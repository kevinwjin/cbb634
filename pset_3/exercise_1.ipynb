      "Episodic memory decline is an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) - a neurodegenerative disease that has a higher prevalence rate in older females compared to older males. However, little is known about why these sex differences in prevalence rate exist. In the current longitudinal task fMRI study, we explored whether there were sex differences in the patterns of memory decline and brain activity during object-location (spatial context) encoding and retrieval in a large sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Novel or Experimental Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (PREVENT-AD) program who are at heightened risk of developing AD due to having a family history (+FH) of the disease. The goal of the study was to gain insight into whether there are sex differences in the neural correlates of episodic memory decline, which may advance knowledge about sex-specific patterns in the natural progression to AD. Our results indicate that +FH females performed better than +FH males at both baseline and follow-up on neuropsychological and task fMRI measures of episodic memory. Moreover, multivariate data-driven task fMRI analysis identified generalized patterns of longitudinal decline in medial temporal lobe activity that was paralleled by longitudinal increases in lateral prefrontal cortex, caudate and midline cortical activity during successful episodic retrieval and novelty detection in +FH males, but not females. Post-hoc analyses indicated that higher education had a stronger effect on +FH females neuropsychological scores compared to +FH males. We conclude that higher educational attainment may have a greater neuroprotective effect in older +FH females compared to +FH males.\n",
      "Human genetic variants that introduce an AG into the intronic region between the branchpoint (BP) and the canonical splice acceptor site (ACC) of protein-coding genes can disrupt pre-mRNA splicing. Using our genome-wide BP database, we delineated the BP-ACC segments of all human introns and found extreme depletion of AG/YAG in the [BP+8, ACC-4] high-risk region. We developed AGAIN as a genome-wide computational approach to systematically and precisely pinpoint intronic AG-gain variants within the BP-ACC regions. AGAIN identified 350 AG-gain variants from the Human Gene Mutation Database, all of which alter splicing and cause disease. Among them, 74% created new acceptor sites, whereas 31% resulted in complete exon skipping. AGAIN also predicts the protein-level products resulting from these two consequences. We performed AGAIN on our exome/genomes database of patients with severe infectious diseases but without known genetic etiology and identified a private homozygous intronic AG-gain variant in the antimycobacterial gene \n",
      "Pareidolias, or the misperception of ambiguous stimuli as meaningful objects, are complex visual illusions thought to be phenomenologically similar to Visual Hallucination (VH). VH are a major predictor of dementia in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and are included as a core clinical feature in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). A newly developed Noise Pareidolia Test (NPT) was proposed as a possible surrogate marker for VH in DLB patients as increased pareidolic responses correlated with informant-corroborated accounts of VH. This association could, however, be mediated by visuoperceptual impairment. To understand the drivers of performance on the NPT, we contrasted performances in patient groups that varied both in terms of visuoperceptual ability and rates of VH. N = 43 patients were studied of whom n = 13 had DLB or PD with Dementia (PDD); n = 13 had PD; n = 12 had typical, memory-onset Alzheimer's Disease (tAD); and n = 5 had Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) due to Alzheimer's disease. All patient groups reported pareidolias. Within the Lewy body disorders (PD, DLB, PDD), there was no significant difference in pareidolic response rates between hallucinating and non-hallucinating patients. Visuoperceptual deficits and pareidolic responses were most frequent in the PCA group-none of whom reported VH. Regression analyses in the entire patient cohort indicated that pareidolias were strongly predicted by visuoperceptual impairment but not by the presence of VH. These findings suggest that pareidolias reflect the underlying visuoperceptual impairment of Lewy body disorders, rather than being a direct marker for VH.\n",
      "Multi-view learning is dedicated to integrating information from different views and improving the generalization performance of models. However, in most current works, learning under different views has significant independency, overlooking common information mapping patterns that exist between these views. This paper proposes a Structure Mapping Generative adversarial network (SM-GAN) framework, which utilizes the consistency and complementarity of multi-view data from the innovative perspective of information mapping. Specifically, based on network-structured multi-view data, a structural information mapping model is proposed to capture hierarchical interaction patterns among views. Subsequently, three different types of graph convolutional operations are designed in SM-GAN based on the model. Compared with regular GAN, we add a structural information mapping module between the encoder and decoder wthin the generator, completing the structural information mapping from the micro-view to the macro-view. This paper conducted sufficient validation experiments using public imaging genetics data in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. It is shown that SM-GAN outperforms baseline and advanced methods in multi-label classification and evolution prediction tasks.\n",
      "Guanine-rich DNA strands can fold into non-canonical four-stranded secondary structures named G-quadruplexes (G4s). G4s folded in proximal promoter regions (PPR) are associated either with positive or negative transcriptional regulation. Given that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) affecting G4 folding (G4-Vars) may alter gene transcription, and that SNVs are associated with the human diseases' onset, we undertook a novel comprehensive study of the G4-Vars genome-wide (G4-variome) to find disease-associated G4-Vars located into PPRs. We developed a bioinformatics strategy to find disease-related SNVs located into PPRs simultaneously overlapping with putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs). We studied five G4-Vars disturbing in vitro the folding and stability of the G4s located into PPRs, which had been formerly associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (GRIN2B), a severe familiar coagulopathy (F7), atopic dermatitis (CSF2), myocardial infarction (SIRT1) and deafness (LHFPL5). Results obtained in cultured cells for these five G4-Vars suggest that the changes in the G4s affect the transcription, potentially contributing to the development of the mentioned diseases. Collectively, data reinforce the general idea that G4-Vars may impact on the different susceptibilities to human genetic diseases' onset, and could be novel targets for diagnosis and drug design in precision medicine.\n",
      "The nervous system is one of the most complicated and enigmatic systems within the animal kingdom. Recently, the emergence and development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have provided an unprecedented ability to systematically decipher the cellular heterogeneity and spatial locations of the nervous system from multiple unbiased aspects. However, efficiently integrating, presenting and analyzing massive multiomic data remains a huge challenge. Here, we manually collected and comprehensively analyzed high-quality scRNA-seq and ST data from the nervous system, covering 10 679 684 cells. In addition, multi-omic datasets from more than 900 species were included for extensive data mining from an evolutionary perspective. Furthermore, over 100 neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome) were systematically analyzed for high-throughput screening of putative biomarkers. Differential expression patterns across developmental time points, cell types and ST spots were discerned and subsequently subjected to extensive interpretation. To provide researchers with efficient data exploration, we created a new database with interactive interfaces and integrated functions called the Spatiotemporal Cloud Atlas for Neural cells (SCAN), freely accessible at http://47.98.139.124:8799 or http://scanatlas.net. SCAN will benefit the neuroscience research community to better exploit the spatiotemporal atlas of the neural system and promote the development of diagnostic strategies for various neurological disorders.\n",
      "Unravelling the network pathobiology in neurodegenerative disorders is a popular and promising field of research. We use a relatively newer network measure of assortativity in metabolic connectivity to understand network differences in patients with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) compared to those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n",
      "83 demographically matched patients with dementia (56 AD and 27 MCI) who underwent PET-MRI study, were recruited for this exploratory study. Global and nodal network measures obtained using the BRAPH toolbox were used to derive group-level differences (corrected p<0.05). The methods were validated in age, and gender matched 23 cognitively normal (CN), 25 MCI, and 53 AD patients from the publicly available ADNI data. Regions that revealed significant differences were correlated with the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) scores.\n",
      "Patients with AD revealed significantly increased global assortativity compared to MCI group. In addition, they also revealed increased modularity and decreased participation coefficient. These findings were validated in the ADNI data. We also found that the regional SUV (standard uptake values) measures of the right superior parietal and left superior temporal lobes were proportional to the ACE-III memory subdomain scores.\n",
      "Global errors associated with network assortativity is found in patients with AD making the networks more regular and less resilient. Since the regional measures of these network errors were proportional to memory deficits, these measures could be useful in understanding the network pathobiology in AD.\n",
      "Apolipoprotein E (APOE)*2 and APOE*4 are, respectively, the strongest protective and risk-increasing, common genetic variants for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), making APOE status highly relevant toward clinical trial design and AD research broadly. The associations of APOE genotypes with AD are modulated by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and ancestry, but these associations remain unclear, particularly among racial and ethnic groups understudied in the AD and genetics research fields.\n",
      "To assess the stratified associations of APOE genotypes with AD risk across sex, age, race and ethnicity, and global population ancestry.\n",
      "This genetic association study included case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts that recruited referred and volunteer participants. Data were analyzed between March 2022 and April 2023. Genetic data were available from high-density, single-nucleotide variant microarrays, exome microarrays, and whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. Summary statistics were ascertained from published AD genetic studies.\n",
      "The main outcomes were risk for AD (odds ratios [ORs]) and risk of conversion to AD (hazard ratios [HRs]), with 95% CIs. Risk for AD was evaluated through case-control logistic regression analyses. Risk of conversion to AD was evaluated through Cox proportional hazards regression survival analyses.\n",
      "Among 68 756 unique individuals, analyses included 21 852 East Asian (demographic data not available), 5738 Hispanic (68.2% female; mean [SD] age, 75.4 [8.8] years), 7145 non-Hispanic Black (hereafter referred to as Black) (70.8% female; mean [SD] age, 78.4 [8.2] years), and 34 021 non-Hispanic White (hereafter referred to as White) (59.3% female; mean [SD] age, 77.0 [9.1] years) individuals. There was a general, stepwise pattern of ORs for APOE*4 genotypes and AD risk across race and ethnicity groups. Odds ratios for APOE*34 and AD risk attenuated following East Asian (OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 3.99-5.17),White (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 3.27-3.65), Black (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.90-2.49) and Hispanic (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.65-2.18) individuals. Similarly, ORs for APOE*22+23 and AD risk attenuated following White (OR, 0.53, 95% CI, 0.48-0.58), Black (OR, 0.69, 95% CI, 0.57-0.84), and Hispanic (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.10) individuals, with no association for Hispanic individuals. Deviating from the global pattern of ORs, APOE*22+23 was not associated with AD risk in East Asian individuals (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.23). Global population ancestry could not explain why Hispanic individuals showed APOE associations with less pronounced AD risk compared with Black and White individuals. Within Black individuals, decreased global African ancestry or increased global European ancestry showed a pattern of APOE*4 dosage associated with increasing AD risk, but no such pattern was apparent for APOE*2 dosage with AD risk. The sex-by-age-specific interaction effect of APOE*34 among White individuals (higher risk in women) was reproduced but shifted to ages 60 to 70 years (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10-2.01) and was additionally replicated in a meta-analysis of Black individuals and Hispanic individuals (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01-2.94).\n",
      "Through recent advances in AD-related genetic cohorts, this study provided the largest-to-date overview of the association of APOE with AD risk across age, sex, race and ethnicity, and population ancestry. These novel insights are critical to guide AD clinical trial design and research.\n",
      "For the Alzheimer disease (AD) therapies to effectively attenuate clinical progression, it may be critical to intervene before the onset of amyloid-associated tau spreading, which drives neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Time points at which amyloid-associated tau spreading accelerates may depend on individual risk factors, such as apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE4) carriership, which is linked to faster disease progression; however, the association of ApoE4 with amyloid-related tau spreading is unclear.\n",
      "To assess if ApoE4 carriers show accelerated amyloid-related tau spreading and propose amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) thresholds at which tau spreading accelerates in ApoE4 carriers vs noncarriers.\n",
      "This cohort study including combined ApoE genotyping, amyloid PET, and longitudinal tau PET from 2 independent samples: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 237; collected from April 2015 to August 2022) and Avid-A05 (n = 130; collected from December 2013 to July 2017) with a mean (SD) tau PET follow-up time of 1.9 (0.96) years in ADNI and 1.4 (0.23) years in Avid-A05. ADNI is an observational multicenter Alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative and Avid-A05 an observational clinical trial. Participants classified as cognitively normal (152 in ADNI and 77 in Avid-A05) or mildly cognitively impaired (107 in ADNI and 53 in Avid-A05) were selected based on ApoE genotyping, amyloid-PET, and longitudinal tau PET data availability. Participants with ApoE ε2/ε4 genotype or classified as having dementia were excluded. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity templates were based on 42 healthy participants in ADNI.\n",
      "Mediation of amyloid PET on the association between ApoE4 status and subsequent tau PET increase through Braak stage regions and interaction between ApoE4 status and amyloid PET with annual tau PET increase through Braak stage regions and connectivity-based spreading stages (tau epicenter connectivity ranked regions).\n",
      "The mean (SD) age was 73.9 (7.35) years among the 237 ADNI participants and 70.2 (9.7) years among the 130 Avid-A05 participants. A total of 107 individuals in ADNI (45.1%) and 45 in Avid-A05 (34.6%) were ApoE4 carriers. Across both samples, we found that higher amyloid PET-mediated ApoE4-related tau PET increased globally (ADNI b, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.28; P = .001 and Avid-A05 b, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.54; P < .001) and in earlier Braak regions. Further, we found a significant association between ApoE4 status by amyloid PET interaction and annual tau PET increases consistently through early Braak- and connectivity-based stages where amyloid-related tau accumulation was accelerated in ApoE4carriers vs noncarriers at lower centiloid thresholds, corrected for age and sex.\n",
      "The findings in this study indicate that amyloid-related tau accumulation was accelerated in ApoE4 carriers at lower amyloid levels, suggesting that ApoE4 may facilitate earlier amyloid-driven tau spreading across connected brain regions. Possible therapeutic implications might be further investigated to determine when best to prevent tau spreading and thus cognitive decline depending on ApoE4 status.\n",
      "Insulin signaling cascade in peripheral insulin sensitive tissues regulates whole-body glucose metabolism. Any deregulation in this pathway leads to insulin resistance, ultimately leading to metabolic diseases like diabetes-I, -II, obesity, etc. Insulin signaling in the brain has also been studied for many decades, and associated with many primary functions like maintaining synaptic plasticity, regulating cognition, circadian rhythm etc. Importantly, neuronal insulin signaling has also been associated with regulating neuronal glucose uptake. Any impairment in neuronal insulin signaling affecting neuronal glucose uptake has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disorder, which is now being termed as type-3 diabetes. Since the criticality lies in proper signaling cascade, determining important points of deregulation is important. In this review, we have discussed some critical points of such deregulation, dividing them into two classes: kinases and phosphatases. We have highlighted their individual roles in neuronal insulin signaling, possible implications in neuronal insulin resistance. Future strategies in targeting these nodes in neuronal insulin signaling might be helpful in potential therapeutic opportunities to overcome neuronal insulin resistance and related neurodegenerative diseases.\n",

Mean (SD) age was 74.0 (7.5) years, and 195 of 345 patients were female (56.5%). Patients receiving brexpiprazole, 2 or 3 mg (n = 225), demonstrated statistically significantly greater improvement than those taking placebo (n = 116) in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total score from baseline to week 12 (brexpiprazole baseline, 80.6, mean change, -22.6; placebo baseline, 79.2, mean change, -17.3; least-squares mean difference, -5.32; 95% CI, -8.77 to -1.87; P = .003; Cohen d effect size, 0.35).

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is traditionally considered as a brain disorder featured by amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition. The current study on whether pathological changes of AD extend to the enteric nervous system (ENS) is still in its infancy. In this study, we found enteric Aβ deposition, intestinal dysfunction, and colonic inflammation in the young APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, these mice exhibited cholinergic and nitrergic signaling pathways damages and enteric neuronal loss. Our data show that Aβ42 treatment remarkably affected the gene expression of cultured myenteric neurons and the spontaneous contraction of intestinal smooth muscles. The intra-colon administration of Aβ42 induced ENS dysfunction, brain gliosis, and β-amyloidosis-like changes in the wild-type mice. Our results suggest that ENS mirrors the neuropathology observed in AD brains, and intestinal pathological changes may represent the prodromal events, which contribute to brain pathology in AD. In summary, our findings provide new opportunities for AD early diagnosis and prevention.\n",

      "Recent research indicates that multiple sclerosis is preceded by a prodromal phase with elevated levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), a marker of axonal injury. The effect of environmental risk factors on the extent of axonal injury during this prodrome is unknown. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study was to determine if HHV-6A serostatus is associated with the level of sNfL in the multiple sclerosis prodrome, which would support a causative role of HHV-6A. A nested case-control study was performed by crosslinking multiple sclerosis registries with Swedish biobanks. Individuals with biobank samples collected before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis were included as cases. Controls without multiple sclerosis were randomly selected, matched for biobank, sex, sampling date and age. Serostatus of HHV-6A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was analysed with a bead-based multiplex assay. The concentration of sNfL was analysed with Single molecule array technology. The association between HHV-6A serology and sNfL was assessed by stratified t-tests and linear regressions, adjusted for EBV serostatus and sampling age. Within-pair ratios of HHV-6A seroreactivity and sNfL were calculated for each case and its matched control. To assess the temporal relationship between HHV-6A antibodies and sNfL, these ratios were plotted against the time to the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis and compared using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing regressions with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Samples from 519 matched case-control pairs were included. In cases, seropositivity of HHV-6A was significantly associated with the level of sNfL (+11%, 95% CI 0.2-24%, P = 0.045), and most pronounced in the younger half of the cases (+24%, 95% CI 6-45%, P = 0.007). No such associations were observed among the controls. Increasing seroreactivity against HHV-6A was detectable before the rise of sNfL (significant within-pair ratios from 13.6 years vs 6.6 years before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis). In this study, we describe the association between HHV-6A antibodies and the degree of axonal injury in the multiple sclerosis prodrome. The findings indicate that elevated HHV-6A antibodies both precede and are associated with a higher degree of axonal injury, supporting the hypothesis that HHV-6A infection may contribute to multiple sclerosis development in a proportion of cases.\n",
      "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a key physiological component of the central nervous system (CNS), maintaining nutrients, clearing waste, and protecting the brain from pathogens. The inherent barrier properties of the BBB pose a challenge for therapeutic drug delivery into the CNS to treat neurological diseases. Impaired BBB function has been related to neurological disease. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the deposition of amyloid in the cerebral vasculature leading to a compromised BBB, is a co-morbidity in most cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that BBB dysfunction or breakdown may be involved in neurodegeneration. Due to limited access to human BBB tissue, the mechanisms that contribute to proper BBB function and BBB degeneration remain unknown. To address these limitations, we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived BBB (iBBB) by incorporating endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes in a 3D matrix. The iBBB self-assembles to recapitulate the anatomy and cellular interactions present in the BBB. Seeding iBBBs with amyloid captures key aspects of CAA. Additionally, the iBBB offers a flexible platform to modulate genetic and environmental factors implicated in cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration, to investigate how genetics and lifestyle affect disease risk. Finally, the iBBB can be used for drug screening and medicinal chemistry studies to optimize therapeutic delivery to the CNS. In this protocol, we describe the differentiation of the three types of cells (endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes) arising from human pluripotent stem cells, how to assemble the differentiated cells into the iBBB, and how to model CAA in vitro using exogenous amyloid. This model overcomes the challenge of studying live human brain tissue with a system that has both biological fidelity and experimental flexibility, and enables the interrogation of the human BBB and its role in neurodegeneration.\n",
      "Primary care clinicians have an important role in the management of dementia and have expressed interest in continuing education. The authors describe a model they used for providing dementia education in primary care, Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes), and an overview of its major features.

A mixed-methods methodology was used for programmatic evaluation. This use of mixed methods adds vital new knowledge and learner perspectives that are key to planning subsequent ECHO courses related to dementia and primary care. The discussion includes an exploration of the significance of these findings for understanding the motivations of primary care providers for participation in the educational program, as well as the limitations of the current study.

Methods and Results Using 2013 to 2017 US Medicare claims linked to Minimum Data Set records, we conducted a retrospective cohort study. We identified DOAC initiators (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban) aged ≥65 years with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation residing in a nursing home. We estimated inverse-probability of treatment weights for DOAC dose using propensity scores. We examined safety (hospitalization for major bleeding) and effectiveness outcomes (all-cause mortality, thrombosis [myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, venous thromboembolism]). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs using cause-specific hazard-regression models. Of 21 878 DOAC initiators, 48% received reduced dosing. The mean age of residents was 82.0 years, 66% were female, and 31% had moderate/severe cognitive impairment. After estimating inverse-probability of treatment weights, standard dosing was associated with a higher rate of bleeding (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.03-1.37]; 9.4 versus 8.0 events per 100 person-years).

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. AD patients usually present symptoms, such as cognitive dysfunction, progressive memory loss, and other manifestations. With the increasing number of AD cases worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop effective drug treatments. Currently, drugs targeting AD symptoms may not change or prevent the progression of the disease. Curcumin, a polyphenol extracted from the turmeric herb, has been used for the treatment of AD. In this review, we summarized both cellular and animal studies and described the mechanism of action of curcumin in altering the pathological features of AD. Curcumin attenuates the formation of amyloid-β plaques and promotes its decomposition, reduces the phosphorylation of tau, improves its clearance rate, and binds with copper to reduce cholesterol. It changes the activity of microglia, suppresses acetylcholinesterase, regulates insulin signal transduction, and exhibits antioxidant properties. Studies have found that curcumin can promote nerve repair and has a significant effect on AD. However, the low bioavailability of curcumin may hinder its use as a therapeutic agent. If this limitation can be overcome, curcumin may emerge as a promising drug for the treatment of AD.\n",

      "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in aging adults across the United States. Prior studies indicate that the presence of atherosclerosis, the pathogenic basis of CVD, is linked with dementias. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias are a major public health challenge in the United States. Recent studies indicate that ≈3.7 million Americans ≥65 years of age had clinical AD in 2017, with projected increases to 9.3 million by 2060. Treatment options for AD remain limited. Development of disease-modifying therapies are challenging due, in part, to the long preclinical window of AD. The preclinical incubation period of AD starts in midlife, providing a critical window for identification and optimization of AD risk factors. Studies link AD with CVD risk factors such as hypertension, inflammation, and dyslipidemia. Both AD and CVD are progressive diseases with decades-long development periods. CVD can clinically manifest several years earlier than AD, making CVD and its risk factors a potential predictor of future AD. The current review focuses on the state of literature on molecular and metabolic pathways modulating the heart-brain axis underlying the potential association of midlife CVD risk factors and their effect on AD and related dementias. Further, we explore potential CVD/dementia preventive strategies during the window of opportunity in midlife and the future of research in the field in the multiomics and novel biomarker use era.\n",

      "It is common for people with Alzheimer’s disease to experience agitation, for example feeling restless or unsettled. If left untreated, agitation can lead to poorer quality of life and increased hospitalisation and strain for family carers. Often these symptoms are treated with medications that are usually used to manage psychosis (antipsychotic drugs), but such medication has limited effectiveness and can cause serious adverse effects to patients, including risk of increased death. Two medications that are already commonly prescribed for other health issues, mirtazapine (an antidepressant) and carbamazepine (a drug used to treat epilepsy), had been identified as a possible alternative way of treating agitation in Alzheimer’s disease that might not have the harms associated with antipsychotic medication. In this study, we compared the effects of giving mirtazapine or carbamazepine with a dummy drug (placebo) in people with Alzheimer’s disease who were experiencing agitation. The results of the study showed that neither medication was any more effective than the placebo in reducing agitation over 12 weeks in terms of improving symptoms, or in economic terms. Mirtazapine may lead to additional carer costs as compared to placebo. The study findings are stronger for mirtazapine than carbamazepine because the carbamazepine arm was stopped when it had recruited less than half the numbers needed. That was done because the study was not recruiting quickly enough to support both the mirtazapine and the carbamazepine arms. The findings from this study show that mirtazapine should not be recommended to treat agitation in Alzheimer’s disease. More work is needed to formulate effective ways and to test new drug and non-drug treatments for agitation in dementia.\n",

      "The structure and function of the brain greatly rely on different signaling pathways. The wide variety of biological processes, including neurogenesis, axonal remodeling, the development and maintenance of pre- and postsynaptic terminals, and excitatory synaptic transmission, depends on combined actions of these molecular pathways. From that point of view, it is important to investigate signaling pathways and their crosstalk in order to better understand the formation of toxic proteins during neurodegeneration. With recent discoveries, it is established that the modulation of several pathological events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Wnt signaling, 5'-adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, silent mating-type information regulator 2 homologue 1) are central to the key findings. These include decreased amyloid formation and inflammation, mitochondrial dynamics control, and enhanced neural stability. This review intends to emphasize the importance of these signaling pathways, which collectively determine the fate of neurons in AD in several ways. This review will also focus on the role of novel synthetic and natural bioactive molecules in balancing the intricate crosstalk among different pathways in order to prolong the longevity of AD patients.\n",

      "Efficient cellular communication is essential for the brain to regulate diverse functions like muscle contractions, memory formation and recall, decision-making, and task execution. This communication is facilitated by rapid signaling through electrical and chemical messengers, including voltage-gated ion channels and neurotransmitters. These messengers elicit broad responses by propagating action potentials and mediating synaptic transmission. Calcium influx and efflux are essential for releasing neurotransmitters and regulating synaptic transmission. Mitochondria, which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and the energy generation process, also interact with the endoplasmic reticulum to store and regulate cytoplasmic calcium levels.

      "SRY-box transcription factor 21 antisense divergent transcript 1 (SOX21-AS1) is a multifaceted long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that plays diverse roles in both neoplastic conditions and Alzheimer's disease. Its aberrant expression intricately regulates a wide spectrum of cellular processes, spanning from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, migration, metastasis, and stemness to drug resistance. SOX21-AS1 achieves these effects through its involvement in the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, modulation of downstream genes, and regulation of critical pathways, including PI3K/AKT, Hippo, Wnt/β-catenin, and ERK signaling. Of significant clinical relevance, SOX21-AS1 expression has shown robust correlations with various clinical-pathological features. Moreover, it has demonstrated promising prognostic and diagnostic potential across a spectrum of tumors, as evidenced by existing literature and TCGA pan-cancer analyses. In Alzheimer's disease, SOX21-AS1 assumes a distinctive role. It influences neuronal viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress by interacting with miR-107 and miR-132, and affecting the PI3K/AKT and Wnt signaling pathways. This comprehensive review sheds light on the functions of SOX21-AS1 and the regulated mechanisms underpinning its impact on neoplastic conditions and Alzheimer's disease. It underscores the clinical significance of SOX21-AS1 and positions it as a promising therapeutic target in both the oncological and neurodegenerative domains.\n",

Files with at least one hit were selected and analyzed with regard to diagnoses, age, age at epilepsy onset, and the question as to whether epilepsy preceded or followed the dementia diagnosis.\n",
      "Among the medical letters of 513 patients, dementia-related terms were found. The letters of 12.7% of these patients stated a dementia diagnosis, 6.6% were suspected of having dementia, 4.9% had mild cognitive impairment, and 6.6% had other neurodegenerative diseases without dementia. Taking all 40,360 patients into account, the prevalence of diagnosed or suspected dementia was 0.25%. An older age (≥60 years) and late-onset epilepsy (≥60 years), but not a longer epilepsy duration, increased the odds of dementia by 6.1 (CI 3.5-10.7) and 2.9 (CI 1.7-4.7), respectively.

However, physicians should be aware that the risk of dementia is higher in the elderly, in late-onset epilepsies, and when comorbid risk factors exist.

      "The severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the сoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have become a global health threat. At the height of the pandemic, major efforts were focused on reducing COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. Now is the time to study the long-term effects of the pandemic, particularly cognitive impairment associated with long COVID. In recent years much attention has been paid to the possible relationship between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease, which is considered a main cause of age-related cognitive impairment. Genetic predisposition was shown for both COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease. However, the analysis of the similarity of the genetic architecture of these diseases is usually limited to indicating a positive genetic correlation between them. In this review, we have described intrinsic linkages between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease, pointed out shared susceptibility genes that were previously identified in genome-wide association studies of both COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease, and highlighted a panel of SNPs that includes candidate genetic risk markers of the long COVID-associated cognitive impairment.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia and is anticipated to impose a substantial economic burden in the future. Over a significant period, the widely accepted amyloid cascade hypothesis has guided research efforts, and the recent FDA approval of an anti- amyloid-beta (Aβ) protofibrils antibody, believed to decelerate AD progression, has further solidified its significance. However, the excessive emphasis placed on the amyloid cascade hypothesis has overshadowed the physiological nature of Aβ and tau proteins within axons. Axons, specialized neuronal structures, sustain damage during the early stages of AD, exerting a pivotal influence on disease progression. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the relationship between axonal damage and AD pathology, amalgamating the physiological roles of Aβ and tau proteins, along with the impact of AD risk genes such as APOE and TREM2. Furthermore, we underscore the exceptional significance of axonal damage in the context of AD.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the leading contributors of dementia globally with approximately 60-70% of its cases. Current research is focused on the mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is associated with cognitive decline but does not disrupt routine activities. Event-related potential (ERP) research is essential in screening patients with MCI. Low-density channel electroencephalography (EEG) is frequently used due to its convenience, portability, and affordability, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. Despite extensive research on neural biomarkers for cognitive impairment, there is a considerable gap in understanding the effects on early stages of cognitive processes, particularly when combining physiological and cognitive markers using portable devices. The present study aimed to examine cognitive shortfalls and behavioral changes in patients with MCI using prefrontal selective attention ERP recorded from a prefrontal two-channel EEG device.\n",
      "We assessed cognitive decline using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB). We administered auditory selective attention tasks to 598 elderly participants, including those with MCI (160) and cognitively normal (CN) individuals (407). We conducted statistical analyses such as independent t-tests, Pearson's correlations, and univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses to assess group differences and associations between neuropsychological tests, ERP measures, behavioral measures, and MCI prevalence.\n",
      "Our findings revealed that patients with MCI demonstrated slower information-processing abilities, and exhibited poorer task execution, characterized by reduced accuracy, increased errors, and higher variability in response time, compared to CN adults. Multiple logistic regression analyses confirmed the association between some ERP and behavioral measures with MCI prevalence, independent of demographic and neuropsychological factors. A relationship was observed between neuropsychological scores, ERP, and behavioral measures.\n",
      "The slower information processing abilities, and poor task execution in the MCI group compared to the CN individuals suggests flawed neurological changes and reduced attentional maintenance during cognitive processing, respectively. Hence, the utilization of portable EEG devices to capture prefrontal selective attention ERPs, in combination with behavioral assessments, holds promise for the identification of mild cognitive deficits and neural alterations in individuals with MCI. This approach could potentially augment the traditional neuropsychological tests during clinical screening for MCI.\n",

Otolith influence on hippocampal volume in preserved semicircular canal function was evaluated (n = 34).\n",
      "Whole-brain and targeted hippocampal approaches using volumetric and surface-based measures yielded no significant differences when comparing BV to controls. Binary support vector machines were unable to classify inner ear health status above chance level. Otolith parameters were not associated with hippocampal volume in preserved semicircular canal function.\n",

      "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a prodromal state of dementia. Abnormal values of cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (CSF-AD-b) have been associated with a higher risk of conversion to dementia (due to Alzheimer's disease), but studies evaluating the ability of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in this task are lacking.\n",
      "This study aims to investigate the relationship between MoCA and CSF-AD-b, as well as the ability of those tools to predict conversion to dementia.\n",
      "Taking advantage of our MCI cohort with biological characterization on longitudinal follow-up (180 patients followed for 62.6 months during which 41.3% converted), we computed MoCA and MMSE z-scores, using Portuguese normative data. The performance in MoCA z-score was correlated with CSF-AD-b and the relative time to conversion and risk according to baseline characteristics were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models.\n",
      "MoCA z-scores were correlated with Aβ42 (p = 0.026), t-tau (p = 0.033), and p-tau (p = 0.01). Impaired MMSE (p < 0.001) and MoCA z-scores (p = 0.019), decreased Aβ42 (p < 0.001) and increased t-tau (p < 0.001) and p-tau (p < 0.001) were associated with shorter estimated time of conversion. Aβ42 (p < 0.001) and MMSE z-scores (p = 0.029) were independent predictors of conversion. For those with at least 9 years of education, MoCA z-score (p = 0.004) (but not MMSE) was an independent predictor of conversion as well as Aβ42.\n",
      "This study confirms the role of CSF-AD-b, namely Aβ42, in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia and suggests the utility of MoCA in predicting conversion in highly educated subjects, supporting its use in the evaluation of MCI patients.\n",
      "Cross-Cultural Dementia Screening (CCD), Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS), and European Cross-cultural Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB) are three novel neuropsychological instruments developed from a cross-cultural perspective to reduce the impact of culture in cognitive assessment and improve the assessment in diverse populations.\n",
      "We aimed to collect and present normative data on these tests in a majority population sample (Spaniards living in Spain) and in a minority population sample (Colombians living in Spain).\n",
      "CCD, RUDAS, and CNTB were administered to a group of 300 cognitively healthy participants (150 Spaniards and 150 Colombians). Linear regression modeling strategy was used to provide adjusted norms for demographic factors and to explore the influence of these factors on test performance.\n",
      "Most of the CCD and CNTB scores were predicted by age and years of education, with some tests only predicted by age or showing a ceiling effect. The comparison of normative data between the two samples confirmed the favorable cross-cultural properties of these instruments, with only some differences in processing speed and executive functioning scores.\n",

      " In 2018, the Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) was established to bring together Australia's leading dementia researchers, people with living experience and clinicians to transform research and clinical care in the field. To address dementia diagnosis, treatment, and care, ADNeT has established three core initiatives: the Clinical Quality Registry (CQR), Memory Clinics, and Screening for Trials. Collectively, the initiatives have developed an integrated clinical and research community, driving practice excellence in this field, leading to novel innovations in diagnostics, clinical care, professional development, quality and harmonization of healthcare, clinical trials, and translation of research into practice. Australia now has a national Registry for Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia with 55 participating clinical sites, an extensive map of memory clinic services, national Memory and Cognition Clinic Guidelines and specialized screening for trials sites in five states. This paper provides an overview of ADNeT's achievements to date and future directions. With the increase in dementia cases expected over coming decades, and with recent advances in plasma biomarkers and amyloid lowering therapies, the nationally coordinated initiatives and partnerships ADNeT has established are critical for increased national prevention efforts, co-ordinated implementation of emerging treatments for Alzheimer's disease, innovation of early and accurate diagnosis, driving continuous improvements in clinical care and patient outcome and access to post-diagnostic support and clinical trials. For a heterogenous disorder such as dementia, which is now the second leading cause of death in Australia following cardiovascular disease, the case for adequate investment into research and development has grown even more compelling.\n",
      "Few studies have examined the relationship between non-cognitive factors and activities of daily living (ADL) according to Alzheimer's disease (AD) stage.\n",
      "We aimed to identify the differences in non-cognitive factors according to AD stages and their involvement in basic and instrumental ADL performance by using intrinsic capacity (IC) in groups with cognition ranging from normal to moderate or severe AD.\n",
      "We enrolled 6397 patients aged≥65 years who visited our memory clinic. Non-cognitive IC was assessed using the locomotion, sensory, vitality, and psychological domains. Multiple logistic regression was performed to identify how non-cognitive IC declines over the AD course and examine the correlation between non-cognitive IC and basic and instrumental ADL performance.\n",
      "Non-cognitive IC declined from the initial AD stage and was significantly correlated with both basic and instrumental ADL performance from the aMCI stage through all AD stages. In particular, the relationship between IC and basic ADL was stronger in mild and moderate to severe AD than in the aMCI stage. On the other hand, the relationship between IC and instrumental ADL was stronger in aMCI than in later AD stages.\n",
      "The results show non-cognitive factors, which decline from the aMCI stage, are correlated with ADL performance from the aMCI stage to almost all AD stages. Considering that the relationship strength varied by ADL type and AD stage, an approach tailored to ADL type and AD stage targeting multiple risk factors is likely needed for effectively preventing ADL performance declines.\n",
      "It remains unclear whether changes in the venous circulation contribute to cognitive decline.\n",
      "This study aimed to clarify whether the spontaneous jugular vein reflux (JVR) is associated with cognitive impairment and incident dementia.\n",
      "Patients with any evidence of cerebral vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were consecutively enrolled between October 2015 to July 2019. We employed carotid duplex sonography to measure the internal jugular vein (IJV). The subjects were classified into two groups based on the degree of JVR on either side: none, mild (JVR(-) group) and moderate, severe (JVR (+) group) JVR. They underwent both the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Japanese (MoCA-J) global tests. Their cognitive status was prospectively assessed until March 2023.\n",
      "302 patients with an MMSE score ≥24 underwent duplex sonography of the IJV. Among them, 91 had spontaneous JVR on either side. Both MMSE and MoCA-J were significantly lower in patients with JVR (+) group than in the JVR (-) group. After the adjustment for risk factors and MRI findings, intergroup differences in MoCA-J remained significant. Among the cognitive subdomains, median executive function and memory scores were significantly lower in the JVR (+) group than in the JVR (-) group. During the median 5.2-year follow-up, 11 patients with incident dementia were diagnosed. Patients with severe JVR were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with dementia (log-rank test, p = 0.031).\n",
      "Spontaneous IJV reflux especially severe JVR, was associated with global cognitive function, and potentially with incident dementia.\n",
      "The approval of lecanemab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States has sparked controversy over issues of safety, cost, and efficacy. Furthermore, the prognostication of cognitive decline is prohibitively difficult with current methods. The inability to forecast incipient dementia in patients with biological AD suggests a prophylactic scenario wherein all patients with cognitive decline are prescribed anti-AD drugs at the earliest manifestations of dementia; however, most patients with mild cognitive impairment (approximately 77.7% ) do not develop dementia over a 3-year period. Prophylactic response therefore constitutes unethical, costly, and unnecessary treatment for these patients.\n",
      "We present a snapshot of the costs associated with the first 3 years of mass availability of anti-AD drugs in a variety of scenarios.\n",
      "We consider multiple prognostication scenarios with varying sensitivities and specificities based on neuroimaging studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment to determine approximate costs for the large-scale use of lecanemab.\n",
      "The combination of fluorodeoxyglucose and magnetic resonance was determined to be the most cost-efficient at $177,000 for every positive outcome every 3 years under an assumed adjustment in the price of lecanemab to $9,275 per year.\n",
      "Imaging-assisted identification of cognitive status in patients with prodromal AD is demonstrated to reduce costs and prevent instances of unnecessary treatment in all cases considered. This highlights the potential of this technology for the ethical prescription of anti-AD medications under a paradigm of imaging-assisted early detection for pharmaceutical intervention in the treatment of AD.\n",
      "Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) bring complexity in the clinical management of people with dementia; therefore, it is important to evaluate different models of care, such as Special Care Units (SCU-B).∥Objective:To evaluate the SCU-B effectiveness toward alleviating BPSD and improving the quality of life (QoL) of patients and their caregivers.∥Methods:ReCAGE was a multicenter, controlled, longitudinal study where 508 patients with BPSD were enrolled in two cohorts: 262 patients from centers endowed with a SCU-B, and 246 from centers without SCU-B. Statistical analyses included factorial ANCOVA for comparison among centers. The primary endpoint was effectiveness of the SCU-B, measured through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) changes. Secondary endpoints were change in QoL of patients and caregivers, and the tertiary endpoint was time to nursing home admission.∥Results:The NPI scores decreased in both arms, with a statistically significant difference from baseline to 36 months (p <  0.0001) in both cohorts. Over time, NPI decreased more steeply during the first year in the SCU-B arm, but in the following two years the slope was clearly in favor of the control arm. This different pattern of the two cohorts reached statistical significance at the interaction \"cohort by time\" (p <  0.0001). Conflicting results were found regarding the outcomes of quality of life, while there were no differences in time to institutionalization in both cohorts.∥Conclusion:The RECage study did not confirm the long-term superiority of the pathway comprising a SCU-B. A post-hoc analysis revealed data supporting their acute effectiveness during behavioral crises.\n",
      "Population-based registries represent a unique sample to estimate survival. The aim of the present study was to assess survival rates and predictors of outcome in incidental frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Incident cases with FTLD, included between January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, have been followed for five years. Median survival was 8.16 years from disease onset and 5.38 years from diagnosis. Survival rates did not differ between phenotypes. Shorter disease duration from onset to diagnosis was associated with poorer outcome (p = 0.01). FTLD is a relatively homogeneous disease in terms of survival. Future multinational population-based studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n",

Articles were excluded if they were published prior to 2018, studied a population without dementia or significant risk factors, or did not include those 65 + . The overall quality of each source was analyzed based on the cognitive test(s) used, the selection of subjects, and the sample size.\n",
      "The search generated 33 papers, which yielded 11 articles after screening. Of these studies, one was conducted on those with mild cognitive impairment, one with AD, two with general dementia, and seven with at-risk individuals. All the studies found a positive correlation between adherence and some form of cognitive functioning, but results were mixed for specific cognitive domains.\n",
      "These findings suggest that the MIND diet may be a useful long-term treatment option for those with various dementia pathologies. However, more research is needed on subjects with onset dementias. Additionally, there is a need for more research into the mechanisms behind the common comorbidities.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in older age. The prevalence of AD is growing worldwide, causing a tremendous burden to societies and families. Due to the complexity of its pathogenesis, the current treatment of AD is not satisfactory, and drugs acting on a single target may not prevent AD progression. This review summarizes the multi-target pharmacological effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) on AD. TZDs act as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family member 4 (ACSL4) inhibitors. TZDs ameliorated neuroinflammation and ferroptosis in preclinical models of AD. Here, we discussed recent findings from clinical trials of pioglitazone in the treatment of AD, ischemic stroke, and atherosclerosis. We also dissected the major limitations in the clinical application of pioglitazone and explained the potential benefit of pioglitazone in AD. We recommend the use of pioglitazone to prevent cognitive decline and lower AD risk in a specific group of patients.\n",

Only preclinical studies exploring the biological links between periodontitis and AD pathology were included. This study was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), and the Syrcle and Camarades protocols were used to assess the risk of bias.\n",
      "After a systematic screening of titles and abstracts (n = 3,307), thirty-six titles were selected for abstract reading, of which 13 were excluded (k = 1), resulting in the inclusion of 23 articles. Oral or systemic exposure to periodontopathogens or their byproducts is responsible for both in situ brain manifestations and systemic effects. Significant elevated rates of cytokines and amyloid peptides (Aβ) and derivate products were found in both serum and brain. Additionally, in infected animals, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, hippocampal microgliosis, and neuronal death were observed. Exposure to periodontal infection negatively impairs cognitive behavior, leading to memory decline.\n",

PM2.5 exposure was associated with altered amino acid metabolism, energy production, and oxidative stress response, pathways also associated with Alzheimer's disease. Three metabolites were associated with PM2.5 exposure through all three approaches: cysteinylglycine disulfide, a diglyceride, and a dicarboxylic acid. The relationship between several features and PM2.5 exposure was modified by diet and metabolic diseases.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of neuronal cells. With the increase in aged population, there is a prevalence of irreversible neurodegenerative changes, causing a significant mental, social, and economic burden globally. The factors contributing to AD are multidimensional, highly complex, and not completely understood. However, it is widely known that aging, neuroinflammation, and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with other free radicals, substantially contribute to oxidative stress and cell death, which are inextricably linked. While oxidative stress is undeniably important in AD, limiting free radicals and ROS levels is an intriguing and potential strategy for deferring the process of neurodegeneration and alleviating associated symptoms. Therapeutic compounds from natural sources have recently become increasingly accepted and have been effectively studied for AD treatment. These phytocompounds are widely available and a multitude of holistic therapeutic efficiencies for treating AD owing to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and biological activities. Some of these compounds also function by stimulating cholinergic neurotransmission, facilitating the suppression of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1, α-synuclein, and monoamine oxidase proteins, and deterring the occurrence of AD. Additionally, various phenolic, flavonoid, and terpenoid phytocompounds have been extensively described as potential palliative agents for AD progression. Preclinical studies have shown their involvement in modulating the cellular redox balance and minimizing ROS formation, displaying them as antioxidant agents with neuroprotective abilities. This review emphasizes the mechanistic role of natural products in the treatment of AD and discusses the various pathological hypotheses proposed for AD.\n",

PRKN is located in FRA6E, which is one of the common fragile sites in the human genome, making this region prone to structural variants. However, complex structural variants such as inversions of PRKN are seldom reported, suggesting that there are potentially unrevealed complex pathogenic PRKN structural variants.\n",

      "We have proposed that cognitive resilience (CR) counteracts brain damage from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related dementias such that older individuals who harbor neurodegenerative disease burden sufficient to cause dementia remain cognitively normal. However, CR traditionally is considered a binary trait, capturing only the most extreme examples, and is often inconsistently defined.\n",
      "This study addressed existing discrepancies and shortcomings of the current CR definition by proposing a framework for defining CR as a continuous variable for each neuropsychological test. The linear equations clarified CR's relationship to closely related terms, including cognitive function, reserve, compensation, and damage. Primarily, resilience is defined as a function of cognitive performance and damage from neuropathologic damage. As such, the study utilized data from 844 individuals (age = 79 ± 12, 44% female) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center cohort that met our inclusion criteria of comprehensive lesion rankings for 17 neuropathologic features and complete neuropsychological test results. Machine learning models and GWAS then were used to identify medical and genetic factors that are associated with CR.\n",
      "CR varied across five cognitive assessments and was greater in female participants, associated with longer survival, and weakly associated with educational attainment or APOE ε4 allele. In contrast, damage was strongly associated with APOE ε4 allele (P value < 0.0001). Major predictors of CR were cardiovascular health and social interactions, as well as the absence of behavioral symptoms.\n",
      "Our framework explicitly decoupled the effects of CR from neuropathologic damage. Characterizations and genetic association study of these two components suggest that the underlying CR mechanism has minimal overlap with the disease mechanism. Moreover, the identified medical features associated with CR suggest modifiable features to counteract clinical expression of damage and maintain cognitive function in older individuals.\n",
      "Little is known about how physical activity influences the relationship between neuroticism and cognitive function and cognitive decline.\n",
      "Data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) was utilized to conduct this study. CHAP is a population-based cohort study of chronic conditions in older adults. Participants completed in-home interviews cycles of three years from 1993-2012. Mixed effects regression models were conducted to test the associations between physical activity, neuroticism, and the interaction between neuroticism and physical activity on outcomes: global cognitive function, global cognitive decline, episodic memory, decline in episodic memory, perceptual speed, and decline in perceptual speed. Stratified mixed effects regression models by physical activity level were conducted to test the associations between neuroticism and global cognitive function and global cognitive decline.\n",
      "A total of 7,685 participants were eligible for this study. Participants were 62% female and 64% African American. We found statistically significant associations for the interaction of high physical activity and neuroticism on baseline global cognitive function (β = 0.017 (SE = 0.007), p = .010) and on the interaction of neuroticism and high physical activity on baseline episodic memory (β = 0.020 (SE = .009), p = .021) and on decline in episodic memory over time (β = -0.003 (SE = .001), p = .039).\n",

      "Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has extended lifespans of people living with HIV (PWH), increasing both the risk for age-related neuropathologies and the importance of distinguishing effects of HIV and its comorbidities from neurodegenerative disorders. The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in hippocampus is a common degenerative change, with specific patterns of hippocampal subfield vulnerability observed in different disease contexts. Currently, associations between chronic HIV, its comorbidities, and p-tau burden and distribution in the hippocampus are unexplored. We used immunohistochemistry with antibody AT8 to analyze hippocampal p-tau in brain tissues of PWH (n = 71) and HIV negative controls (n = 25), for whom comprehensive clinical data were available. Using a morphology-based neuroanatomical segmentation protocol, we annotated digital slide images to measure percentage p-tau areas in the hippocampus and its subfields. Factors predicting p-tau burden and distribution were identified in univariate analyses, and those with significance at p ≤ 0.100 were advanced to multivariable regression. The patient sample had a mean age of 61.5 years. Age predicted overall hippocampal p-tau burden. Subfield p-tau predictors were for Cornu Ammonis (CA)1, age; for CA2 and subiculum, seizure history; for CA3, seizure history and head trauma; and for CA4/dentate, history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In this autopsy sample, hippocampal p-tau burden and distribution were not predicted by HIV, viral load, or immunologic status, with viral effects limited to associations between HCV and CA4/dentate vulnerability. Hippocampal p-tau pathologies in cART-era PWH appear to reflect age and comorbidities, but not direct effects of HIV infection.\n",
      "Healthy lifestyle might alleviate the socioeconomic inequities in health, but the extent of the joint and interactive effects of these two factors on dementia are unclear. This study aimed to detect the joint and interactive associations of socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle factors with incident dementia risk, and the underlying brain imaging alterations. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to test the joint and interactive associations. Partial correlation analysis was performed to reflect the brain imaging alterations. A total of 276,730 participants with a mean age of 55.9 (±8.0) years old from UK biobank were included. Over 8.5 (±2.6) years of follow-up, 3013 participants were diagnosed with dementia. Participants with high SES and most healthy lifestyle had a significantly lower risk of incident dementia (HR=0.19, 95% CI=0.14 to 0.26, P<2×10\n",
      "Disruptions to iron metabolism and iron homeostasis have emerged as significant contributors to the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human transferrin plays a key part in maintaining iron equilibrium throughout the body, highlighting its importance in AD. Many plant-derived compounds and dietary constituents show promise for preventing AD. Polyphenols that are abundant in fruits, vegetables, teas, coffee, and herbs possess neuroprotective attributes. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol present in various plant sources like grapes, berries, peanuts, and red wine that has garnered research interest due to its wide range of biological activities. Notably, resveratrol exhibits neuroprotective effects that may help prevent or treat AD through multiple mechanisms. In the present study, we employed a combination of molecular docking and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (MD) along with experimental approaches to unravel the intricate interactions between transferrin and resveratrol deciphering the binding mechanism. Through molecular docking analysis, it was determined that resveratrol occupies the iron binding pocket of transferrin. Furthermore, MD simulations provided a more profound insight into the stability and conformational dynamics of the complex suggesting that the binding of resveratrol introduced localized flexibility, while maintaining overall stability. The spectroscopic observations yielded clear evidence of substantial binding between resveratrol and transferrin, confirming the computational findings. The identified binding mechanism and conformational stability hold potential for advancing the development of innovative therapeutic approaches targeting AD through resveratrol, particularly concerning iron homeostasis. These insights serve as a platform for considering the natural compounds in the realm of AD therapeutics.\n",

      "Intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated misfolded tau proteins is found in many neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau pathology can impact cerebrovascular physiology and function through multiple mechanisms. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that alterations in the blood brain barrier integrity and function can result in synaptic abnormalities and neuronal damage. In the present article, we will summarize how tau proteostasis dysregulation contributes to vascular dysfunction and conversely, we will examine the factors and pathways leading to tau pathological alterations triggered by cerebrovascular dysfunction. Finally, we will highlight the role epigenetic and epitranscriptomic factors play in regulating the integrity of the cerebrovascular system and the progression of tauopathy including a few remarks on potential therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "Many common neurological disorders are associated with advancing chronological age, but their association with biological age (BA) remains poorly understood.\n",
      "We studied 325 870 participants in the UK Biobank without a diagnosed neurological condition at baseline and generated three previously-described measures of BA based on 18 routinely measured clinical biomarkers (PhenoAge, Klemera-Doubal method age (KDMAge), homeostatic dysregulation age). Using survival models, we assessed the effect of advanced BA on incident neurological diagnoses, including all-cause and cause-specific dementia, ischaemic stroke, Parkinson's disease and motor neuron disease.\n",
      "During a mean follow-up of 9.0 years, there were 1397 incident cases of dementia and 2515 of ischaemic stroke, with smaller case numbers of other diagnoses. The strongest associations with a 1 SD in BA residual were seen for all-cause dementia (KDMAge HR=1.19, 95% CI=1.11 to 1.26), vascular dementia (1.41, 1.25 to 1.60) and ischaemic stroke (1.39, 1.34 to 1.46). Weaker associations were seen for Alzheimer's disease and motor neuron disease, while, in contrast, HRs for Parkinson's disease tended to be <1. Results were largely consistent after adjustment for disease-specific covariates including common cardiometabolic risk factors.\n",

      "Artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize the medical and scientific field, especially with the release of ChatGPT. We assessed whether it provides an accurate interpretation of neuropsychological screening. We provided ChatGPT with the neuropsychological data of a patient with mild Alzheimer's Disease and invited it and two neuropsychologists to interpret the data. While ChatGPT provided an accurate interpretation of scores on each of the neuropsychological tests, it did not use standardized scores and did not specify the cognitive domain that may be most impaired. In contrast, the neuropsychologists used standardized scores to determine that the patient was mainly suffering from memory decline. While ChatGPT may succeed in the general interpretation of neuropsychological testing, at least in patients with Alzheimer's Disease, it still cannot create a pattern of scores across different tests to better specify the nature of cognitive impairment.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD related dementias (ADRD) are complex multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases. The associations between genetic variants obtained from genome wide association studies (GWAS) are the most widely available and well documented variants associated with ADRD. Application of deep learning methods to analyze large scale GWAS data may be a powerful approach to elucidate the biological mechanisms in ADRD compared to penalized regression models that may lead to over-fitting.\n",
      "We developed a deep learning frame work explainable variational autoencoder (E-VAE) classifier model using genotype (GWAS SNPs=5474) data from 2714 study participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to classify ADRD. We validated the generalizability of this model among 234 participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Utilizing a linear decoder approach we have extracted the weights associated with latent features for biological interpretation.\n",
      "We obtained a predictive accuracy of 0.71 (95% CI [0.59, 0.84]) with an AUC of 0.69 in the HRS test dataset and got an accuracy of 0.62 (95% CI [0.56, 0.68]) with an AUC of 0.63 in the ROSMAP dataset.\n",

However, the role of Rlip in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases is not well understood. The purpose of the present study is to determine the role of Rlip in the brains of AD patients and control subjects. To achieve our goals, we used frozen tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded postmortem brains from AD patients of different Braak stages and age-matched control subjects. Our immunohistology and immunoblotting blotting analysis revealed that expression of Rlip protein gradually and significantly decreased (p = 0.0001) with AD progression, being lowest in Braak stage IV-V. Rlip was colocalized with Amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) as observed by IHC staining and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Lipid peroxidation (4-HNE generation) and H\n",
      "Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory cascade involved in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other relevant diseases. The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane immune receptor that is primarily expressed by microglia in the central nervous system (CNS). While TREM2 is initially believed to be an anti-inflammatory factor in the CNS, increasing evidence suggests that TREM2 plays a more complex role in balancing neuroinflammation. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Notably, TREM2 directly regulates microglia inflammation through various signaling pathways. Additionally, studies have suggested that TREM2 mediates microglial phagocytosis, autophagy, metabolism, and microglia phenotypes, which may be involved in the modulation of neuroinflammation. In this review, we aim to discuss the critical role of TREM2 in several microglia functions and the underlying molecular mechanism the modulatory which further mediate neuroinflammation, and elaborate. Finally, we discuss the potential of TREM2 as a therapeutic target in neuroinflammatory disorders.\n",
      "Non-Alzheimer's dementia (NAD) accounts for 30% of all neurodegenerative conditions and is characterized by cognitive decline beyond mere memory dysfunction. Diagnosing NAD remains challenging due to the lack of established biomarkers. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurophysiological tool that enables the investigation of cortical excitability in the human brain. Paired-pulse TMS paradigms include short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI/LICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which can assess neurophysiological functions of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic neural circuits, respectively. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these TMS indices among patients with NAD and healthy controls. Our meta-analyses indicated that TMS neurophysiological examinations revealed decreased glutamatergic function in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and decreased GABAergic function in patients with FTD, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease, cortico-basal syndrome, and multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type. In addition, decreased cholinergic function was found in dementia with Lewy body and vascular dementia. These results suggest the potential of TMS as an additional diagnostic tool to differentiate NAD.\n",

      "A retrospective analysis was conducted on the MRI and clinical data of 121 MCI patients, of whom 32 progressed to AD during a four-year follow-up period. The MCI patients were divided into training and validation sets at a ratio of 7:3. DTI features were extracted from MCI patient data in the training set, and their dimensionality was reduced to construct a radiomics signature (RS). Then, combining the RS with independent predictors of MCI disease progression, a joint model was constructed, and a nomogram was generated. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the diagnostic and clinical efficacy of the nomogram based on the data from the validation set.\n",
      "The AUCs of the RS in the training and validation sets were 0.81 and 0.84, with sensitivities of 0.87 and 0.78 and specificities of 0.71 and 0.81, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the RS, clinical dementia rating scale score, and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale score were the independent predictors of progression and thus used to construct the nomogram. The AUCs of the nomogram in the training and validation sets were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively, with sensitivities of 0.78 and 0.89 and specificities of 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. DCA showed that the nomogram was the most valuable model for predicting the progression of MCI to AD and that it provided greater net benefits than other analysed models.\n",

Accumulation evidence suggests that low toxicity multi-target drugs may play effective roles in AD. Ginseng is the root and rhizome of Panax ginseng Meyer, which can be used not only as herbal medicine but also as a functional food to support body functions. Ginsenoside RK1 (RK1), obtained from ginseng plants through high-temperature treatment, has antiapoptotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects and these events are involved in the development of AD. So, we believe that RK1 may be an effective drug for the treatment of AD.\n",

      "Neuronal damage was detected by MTT assay, LDH assay, immunofluorescence and western blotting. Oxidative stress was measured by JC-1 staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) staining, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malonaldehyde (MDA).

      "RK1 attenuated Aβ-induced apoptosis, restored mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and reduced intracellular levels of ROS in both PC12 cells and primary cultured neurons. In vivo, RK1 significantly improved cognitive deficits and mitigated AD-like pathological features. Notably, RK1 demonstrated superior efficacy compared to the positive control drug, donepezil. Mechanistically, our study elucidates that RK1 modulates the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream target, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), leading to the optimization of mitochondrial membrane potential, reduction of ROS levels, and mitigation of AD-like pathology. It's noteworthy that blocking the AMPK signaling pathway attenuated the protective effects of RK1.\n",

      "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is primarily manifested by a variety of physiological properties of brain endothelial cells (ECs), but the molecular foundation for these properties remains incompletely clear. Here, we generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of adult brain ECs using acutely purified mouse ECs and integrated multi-omics. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics, we identify the transcripts and proteins selectively enriched in brain ECs and demonstrate that they are partially correlated. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we dissect the molecular basis of functional heterogeneity of brain ECs. Using integrative epigenomics and transcriptomics, we determine that TCF/LEF, SOX, and ETS families are top-ranked transcription factors regulating the BBB. We then validate the identified brain-EC-enriched proteins and transcription factors in normal mouse and human brain tissue and assess their expression changes in mice with Alzheimer's disease. Overall, we present a valuable resource with broad implications for regulation of the BBB and treatment of neurological disorders.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible central nervous degenerative disease, while mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor state of AD. Accurate early diagnosis of AD is conducive to the prevention and early intervention treatment of AD. Although some computational methods have been developed for AD diagnosis, most employ only neuroimaging, ignoring other data (e.g., genetic, clinical) that may have potential disease information. In addition, the results of some methods lack interpretability. In this work, we proposed a novel method (called DANMLP) of joining dual attention convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for computer-aided AD diagnosis by integrating multi-modality data of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical data (i.e., demographics, neuropsychology), and APOE genetic data. Our DANMLP consists of four primary components: (1) the Patch-CNN for extracting the image characteristics from each local patch, (2) the position self-attention block for capturing the dependencies between features within a patch, (3) the channel self-attention block for capturing dependencies of inter-patch features, (4) two MLP networks for extracting the clinical features and outputting the AD classification results, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the 5CV test, DANMLP achieves 93% and 82.4% classification accuracy for the AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC tasks on the ADNI database, which is 0.2%∼15.2% and 3.4%∼26.8% higher than that of other five methods, respectively. The individualized visualization of focal areas can also help clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD. These results indicate that DANMLP can be effectively used for diagnosing AD and MCI patients.\n",
      "Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), have the gradual onset of neurobiological changes preceding clinical diagnosis by decades. To elucidate how brain dysfunction proceeds in neurodegenerative disorders, we performed longitudinal characterization of behavioral, morphological, and transcriptomic changes in a tauopathy mouse model, P301S transgenic mice. P301S mice exhibited cognitive deficits as early as 3 months old, and deficits in social preference and social cognition at 5-6 months. They had a significant decrease of arborization in basal dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons from 3 months and apical dendrites of PFC pyramidal neurons at 9 months. Transcriptomic analysis of genome-wide changes revealed the enrichment of synaptic gene upregulation at 3 months of age, while most of these synaptic genes were downregulated in PFC and hippocampus of P301S mice at 9 months. These time-dependent changes in gene expression may lead to progressive alterations of neuronal structure and function, resulting in the manifestation of behavioral symptoms in tauopathies.\n",
      "Traditional and scientific evidence attribute numerous bioactivities of Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn.) in aging-related disorders. In this state-of-art review, an extensive search in several databases was conducted to collect all relevant literature and comprehensively analyze Licorice's pharmacological attributes, neuroprotective properties, safety, and its mechanistic role in treating various neurological conditions. Network pharmacology was employed for the first time exploring the mechanistic role of Licorice in neurological disorders. Its neuroprotective role is attributed to phytoconstituents, including liquiritin, glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritigenin, glabridin, 18ß-glycyrrhetinic acid, quercetin, isoliquiritigenin, paratocarpin B, glycyglabrone, and hispaglabridin B, as evident from in vitro and in vivo studies. Network pharmacology analysis reveals that these compounds protect against long-term depression, aging-associated diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and other addictions through interactions with cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic proteins, validated in animal studies only. Future clinical trials are warranted as Licorice administration has a limiting factor of mild hypertension and hypokalemia. Hopefully, scientific updates on Licorice will propagate a paradigm shift in medicine, research propagation, and development of the central nervous system phytopharmaceuticals.\n",

      "Schizophrenia is associated with increased risk of developing multiple aging-related diseases, including metabolic, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's and related dementias, leading to the hypothesis that schizophrenia is accompanied by accelerated biological aging. This has been difficult to test because there is no widely accepted measure of biological aging. Epigenetic clocks are promising algorithms that are used to calculate biological age on the basis of information from combined cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) across the genome, but they have yielded inconsistent and often negative results about the association between schizophrenia and accelerated aging. Here we test the schizophrenia-aging hypothesis using a DNA methylation measure that is uniquely designed to predict an individual's rate of aging.\n",

      "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is highly prevalent in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The gold standard treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Long-term, well-powered efficacy trials are required to understand whether CPAP could slow cognitive decline in individuals with MCI/AD, but its tolerability in this group remains uncertain. The present review investigates CPAP adherence among individuals with OSA and MCI/AD. Electronic searches were performed on 8 databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Six independent studies and four secondary analyses included 278 unique participants (mean age = 72.1 years). In five of the retained studies, around half of participants (45% N = 85 MCI, 56% N = 22 AD) were adherent to CPAP, where ≥4 h use per night was considered adherent. Three of the retained studies also reported average CPAP use to range between 3.2 and 6.3 h/night. CPAP adherence in individuals with MCI and AD is low, albeit similar to the general elderly population. Reporting adherence in future studies as both average duration as well as using a binary cut-off would improve our understanding of the optimum CPAP use in dementia clinical trials and care.\n",

The University of California, Davis, Health (UCDH) Alzheimer's and Dementia Care (ADC) Program provides care management for PWDs and their FCGs. This pilot study evaluates the program's effect on FCG depression, strain, and distress. Despite an increase in dementia severity in PWDs, FCGs experienced decreased levels of depression, strain, and distress following 12 to 18 months in the UCDH ADC Program. Other findings include PWDs experiencing reductions in severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and remaining at home with FCGs. Despite limitations, such as a relatively small sample size and lack of sample diversity, this pilot study demonstrated positive outcomes to both PWDs and their FCGs and contributes to the literature supporting dementia care management programs. Future projects should address these limitations to understand the experiences of a diverse population and to make dementia care management programs sustainable.\n",
      "To identify trajectories of depressive symptoms in older breast cancer survivors and demographic, psychosocial, physical health, and cancer-related predictors of these trajectories.\n",
      "Recently diagnosed nonmetastatic breast cancer survivors (n = 272), ages 60-98 years, were evaluated for depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, CES-D; scores ≥16 suggestive of clinically significant depressive symptoms). CES-D scores were analyzed in growth-mixture models to determine depression trajectories from baseline (post-surgery, pre-systemic therapy) through 3-year annual follow-up. Multivariable, multinomial logistic regression was used to identify baseline predictors of depression trajectories.\n",
      "Survivors had three distinct trajectories: stable (84.6%), emerging depressive symptoms (10.3%), and recovery from high depressive symptoms at baseline that improved slowly over time (5.1%). Compared to stable survivors, those in the emerging (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.08-1.23) or recovery (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.15-1.38) groups reported greater baseline anxiety. Greater baseline deficit accumulation (frailty composite measure) was associated with emerging depressive symptoms (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.90-7.26). Less social support at baseline (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.15-0.99), but greater improvement in emotional (F = 4.13; p = 0.0006) and tangible (F = 2.86; p = 0.01) social support over time, was associated with recovery from depressive symptoms.\n",
      "Fifteen percent of older breast cancer survivors experienced emerging or recovery depressive symptom trajectories. Baseline anxiety, deficit accumulation, and lower social support were associated with worse outcomes.\n",
      "Our results emphasize the importance of depression screening throughout the course of cancer care to facilitate early intervention. Factors associated with depressive symptoms, including lower levels of social support proximal to diagnosis, could serve as intervention levers.\n",
      "Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), also known as aspirin, was discovered in 1897 as an acetylated form of salicylate. It has been widely used for its anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects. It is commonly used for its cardiovascular benefits and is prescribed as secondary prophylaxis after a heart attack. Furthermore, low-dose, long-term ASA is used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in individuals without prior cardiovascular disease. Acetylsalicylic acid acts as a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX), which inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins and prevents pro-inflammatory cytokines. Findings suggest that targeting cytokines and growth factors could be a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing neuroinflammation and slowing down the progression of dementia. Additionally, prostaglandins contribute to synaptic plasticity and can act as retrograde messengers in synapses. Research has implicated COX-1, one of the isoforms of the enzyme, in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders. The inhibition of COX-1 might potentially prevent impairments in working memory and reduce neuroinflammation caused by beta-amyloid proteins in some conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cyclooxygenase-2, an inducible form of the enzyme, is expressed in cortical and hippocampal neurons and is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. The inhibition or knockout of COX-2 has been shown to decrease long-term potentiation, a process involved in memory formation. Studies have also demonstrated that the administration of COX-2 inhibitors impairs cognitive function and memory acquisition and recall in animal models. There remains a debate regarding the effects of aspirin on dementia and cognitive decline. Although some studies suggest a possible protective effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, against the development of AD, others have shown inconsistent evidence. This review provides an overview of the effects of ASA or its active metabolite salicylate on learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity.\n",
      "The specialised family of triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREMs) plays a pivotal role in causing neurodegenerative disorders and activating microglial anti-inflammatory responses. Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, has been associated with mutations in TREM2, which is also responsible for raising the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we have made an endeavour to differentiate the confirmed pathogenic variants in TREM2 extra-cellular domain (ECD) linked with NHD and AD using mutation-induced fold stability change (∆∆G), with the computation of 12distinct structure-based methods through saturation mutagenesis. Correlation analysis between relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and ∆∆G expresses the discrete distributive behaviour of mutants associated with TREM2 in AD (R\n",
      "ConSurf algorithm and ENDscript were used to determine the position and conservation of each residue in the wild-type ECD of TREM2. The mutation-induced fold stability change (∆∆G) of confirmed pathogenic mutants associated with NHD and AD was estimated using 12 state-of-the-art structure-based protein stability tools. Furthermore, we also computed the effect of random mutation on these sites using computational saturation mutagenesis. Linear regression analysis was performed using mutants ∆∆G and RSA through GraphPad software. In addition, a comprehensive non-bonded residual interaction network (RIN) of wild type and its mutants of TREM2-ECD was enumerated using RING3.0.\n",
      "Non-familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurring before 65 years of age is commonly referred to as early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and constitutes ~ 5-6% of all AD cases (Mendez et al. in Continuum 25:34-51, 2019). While EOAD exhibits the same clinicopathological changes such as amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), brain atrophy, and cognitive decline (Sirkis et al. in Mol Psychiatry 27:2674-88, 2022; Caldwell et al. in Mol Brain 15:83, 2022) as observed in the more prevalent late-onset AD (LOAD), EOAD patients tend to have more severe cognitive deficits, including visuospatial, language, and executive dysfunction (Sirkis et al. in Mol Psychiatry 27:2674-88, 2022). Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been used to model and study penetrative, familial AD (FAD) mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 (Valdes et al. in Research Square 1-30, 2022; Caldwell et al. in Sci Adv 6:1-16, 2020) but have been seldom used for sporadic forms of AD that display more heterogeneous disease mechanisms. In this study, we sought to characterize iPSC-derived neurons from EOAD patients via RNA sequencing. A modest difference in expression profiles between EOAD patients and non-demented control (NDC) subjects resulted in a limited number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Based on this analysis, we provide evidence that iPSC-derived neuron model systems, likely due to the loss of EOAD-associated epigenetic signatures arising from iPSC reprogramming, may not be ideal models for studying sporadic AD.\n",
      "There is a tremendous need for identifying reliable blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that are tied to the biological ATN (amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration) framework as well as clinical assessment and progression.\n",
      "One hundred forty-four elderly participants underwent 18F-AV45 positron emission tomography (PET) scan, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and blood sample collection. The composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was derived from 18F-AV45 PET to assess brain amyloid burden, and the hippocampal volume was determined from structural MRI scans. Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated tau-181 (ptau-181), and neurofilament light (NfL) measured by single molecular array (SIMOA) technology were assessed with respect to ATN framework, genetic risk factor, age, clinical assessment, and future functional decline among the participants.\n",
      "Among the three plasma markers, GFAP best discriminated participants stratified by clinical diagnosis and brain amyloid status. Age was strongly associated with NfL, followed by GFAP and ptau-181 at much weaker extent. Brain amyloid was strongly associated with plasma GFAP and ptau-181 and to a lesser extent with plasma NfL. Moderate association was observed between plasma markers. Hippocampal volume was weakly associated with all three markers. Elevated GFAP and ptau-181 were associated with worse cognition, and plasma GFAP was the most predictive of future functional decline. Combining GFAP and ptau-181 together was the best model to predict brain amyloid status across all participants (AUC = 0.86) or within cognitively impaired participants (AUC = 0.93); adding NfL as an additional predictor only had a marginal improvement.\n",
      "Our findings indicate that GFAP is of potential clinical utility in screening amyloid pathology and predicting future cognitive decline. GFAP, NfL, and ptau-181 were moderately associated with each other, with discrepant relevance to age, sex, and AD genetic risk, suggesting their relevant but differential roles for AD assessment. The combination of GFAP with ptau-181 provides an accurate model to predict brain amyloid status, with the superior performance of GFAP over ptau-181 when the prediction is limited to cognitively impaired participants.\n",
      "The use of mixed effect models with a specific functional form such as the Sigmoidal Mixed Model and the Piecewise Mixed Model (or Changepoint Mixed Model) with abrupt or smooth random change allows the interpretation of the defined parameters to understand longitudinal trajectories. Currently, there are no interface R packages that can easily fit the Sigmoidal Mixed Model allowing the inclusion of covariates or incorporating recent developments to fit the Piecewise Mixed Model with random change.\n",
      "To facilitate the modeling of the Sigmoidal Mixed Model, and Piecewise Mixed Model with abrupt or smooth random change, we have created an R package called nlive. All needed pieces such as functions, covariance matrices, and initials generation were programmed. The package was implemented with recent developments such as the polynomial smooth transition of the piecewise mixed model with improved properties over Bacon-Watts, and the stochastic approximation expectation-maximization (SAEM) for efficient estimation. It was designed to help interpretation of the output by providing features such as annotated output, warnings, and graphs. Functionality, including time and convergence, was tested using simulations. We provided a data example to illustrate the package use and output features and interpretation. The package implemented in the R software is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlive .\n",
      "The nlive package for R fits the Sigmoidal Mixed Model and the Piecewise Mixed: abrupt and smooth. The nlive allows fitting these models with only five mandatory arguments that are intuitive enough to the less sophisticated users.\n",
      "Protein misfolding and aggregation play crucial roles in amyloidogenic diseases through the self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in type II diabetes (T2D), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder after AD, and is associated with the loss of dopaminergic signaling, which causes motor and nonmotor signs and symptoms. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are common pathological hallmarks of PD that are mainly composed of aggregates of disordered α-synuclein (α-Syn). There have been many efforts to develop chemical compounds to prevent aggregation or facilitate disruption of the aggregates. Furthermore, the roles and interactions of many compounds have yet to be revealed at the atomistic level, especially their impacts on the dynamics and chain-chain interactions of the oligomers, which are of interest in this study. The conformational diversity and detailed interactions among homo-oligomer chains of α-Syn are not fully discovered; identifying these might help uncover a practical approach to developing a potent therapy. In this study, we used an in-silico investigation to address the conformational diversity of α-Syn oligomer. The roles of several point mutations in protein aggregation in PD are known; we take this further by evaluating the interaction energies and contributions of all residues in stability and residue-chain interactions. In this study, we docked chemical derivatives of three compounds with high drug-likeness properties to evaluate the roles of our ligands in the conformational dynamicity of the oligomers, with emphasis on intramolecular forces. Free energy evaluation of the modeled inter and intramolecular interactions through MD simulation shows effective interaction and binding between α-Syn and our compounds. However, we find that they do not significantly disrupt the chain-chain interactions, compared to unliganded simulation.\n",
      "Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's are the most common neurodegenerative diseases that are incurable and affect the elderly population. Discovery of effective treatments for these diseases is often difficult, expensive, and serendipitous. Previous comparative studies on different model organisms have revealed that most animals share similar cellular and molecular characteristics. The meta-SNP tool includes four different integrated tools (SIFT, PANTHER, SNAP, and PhD-SNP) was used to identify non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNPs). Prediction of nsSNPs was conducted on three representative proteins for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases; APPl in Drosophila melanogaster, LRRK1 in Aedes aegypti, and VCPl in Tribolium castaneum. With the possibility of using insect models to investigate neurodegenerative diseases. We conclude from the protein comparative analysis between different insect models and nsSNP analyses that D. melanogaster is the best model for Alzheimer's representing five nsSNPs of the 21 suggested mutations in the APPl protein. Aedes aegypti is the best model for Parkinson's representing three nsSNPs in the LRRK1 protein. Tribolium castaneum is the best model for Huntington's disease representing 13 SNPs of 37 suggested mutations in the VCPl protein. This study aimed to improve human neural health by identifying the best insect to model Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's.\n",
      "Identifying circulating proteins associated with cognitive function may point to biomarkers and molecular process of cognitive impairment. Few studies have investigated the association between circulating proteins and cognitive function. We identify 246 protein measures quantified by the SomaScan assay as associated with cognitive function (p < 4.9E-5, n up to 7289). Of these, 45 were replicated using SomaScan data, and three were replicated using Olink data at Bonferroni-corrected significance. Enrichment analysis linked the proteins associated with general cognitive function to cell signaling pathways and synapse architecture. Mendelian randomization analysis implicated higher levels of NECTIN2, a protein mediating viral entry into neuronal cells, with higher Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk (p = 2.5E-26). Levels of 14 other protein measures were implicated as consequences of AD susceptibility (p < 2.0E-4). Proteins implicated as causes or consequences of AD susceptibility may provide new insight into the potential relationship between immunity and AD susceptibility as well as potential therapeutic targets.\n",
      "Emerging evidence shows that the meninges conduct essential immune surveillance and immune defense at the brain border, and the dysfunction of meningeal immunity contributes to aging and neurodegeneration. However, no study exists on the molecular properties of cell types within human leptomeninges. Here, we provide single nuclei profiling of dissected postmortem leptomeninges from aged individuals. We detect diverse cell types, including unique meningeal endothelial, mural, and fibroblast subtypes. For immune cells, we show that most T cells express CD8 and bear characteristics of tissue-resident memory T cells. We also identify distinct subtypes of border-associated macrophages (BAMs) that display differential gene expressions from microglia and express risk genes for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as nominated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We discover cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes in individuals with Alzheimer's dementia, particularly in fibroblasts and BAMs. Indeed, when cultured, leptomeningeal cells display the signature of ex vivo AD fibroblasts upon amyloid-β treatment. We further explore ligand-receptor interactions within the leptomeningeal niche and computationally infer intercellular communications in AD. Thus, our study establishes a molecular map of human leptomeningeal cell types, providing significant insight into the border immune and fibrotic responses in AD.\n",
      "Aβ peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, the normal function of APP and the importance of that role in neurodegenerative disease is less clear. We recover the Drosophila ortholog of APP, Appl, in an unbiased forward genetic screen for neurodegeneration mutants. We perform comprehensive single cell transcriptional and proteomic studies of Appl mutant flies to investigate Appl function in the aging brain. We find an unexpected role for Appl in control of multiple cellular pathways, including translation, mitochondrial function, nucleic acid and lipid metabolism, cellular signaling and proteostasis. We mechanistically define a role for Appl in regulating autophagy through TGFβ signaling and document the broader relevance of our findings using mouse genetic, human iPSC and in vivo tauopathy models. Our results demonstrate a conserved role for APP in controlling age-dependent proteostasis with plausible relevance to Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is frequently misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to similar clinical symptoms. In this study, we constructed frequency-based multilayer resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) networks and extracted representative network features to improve the differentiation between AD and FTD. When compared with healthy controls (HC), AD showed primarily stronger delta-alpha cross-couplings and weaker theta-sigma cross-couplings. Notably, when comparing the AD and FTD groups, we found that the AD exhibited stronger delta-alpha and delta-beta connectivity than the FTD. Thereafter, by extracting the representative network features and then applying these features in the classification between AD and FTD, an accuracy of 81.1% was achieved. Finally, a multivariable linear regressive model was built, based on the differential topologies, and then adopted to predict the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale. Accordingly, the predicted and actual measured scores were indeed significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.274, p = 0.036). These findings consistently suggest that frequency-based multilayer resting-state networks can be utilized for classifying AD and FTD and have potential applications for clinical diagnosis.\n",
      "Cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI), constitute the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Protein-aggregate deposition is a hallmark of aging and neurodegeneration. Our previous study reported that aggregation is strikingly elevated in hearts of hypertensive and aged mice; however, no prior study has addressed MI effects on aggregation in heart or brain. Here, we present novel data on heart and brain aggregation in mice following experimental MI, induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation. Infarcted and peri-infarcted heart tissue, and whole cerebra, were isolated from mice at sacrifice, 7 days following LCA ligation. Sham-MI mice (identical surgery without ligation) served as controls. We purified detergent-insoluble aggregates from these tissues, and quantified key protein constituents by high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Infarct heart tissue had 2.5- to 10-fold more aggregates than non-infarct or sham-MI heart tissue (each P = 0.001). Protein constituents from MI cerebral aggregates overlapped substantially with those from human Alzheimer's disease brain. Prior injection of mice with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) exosomes, shown to limit infarct size after LCA ligation, reduced cardiac aggregation ~ 60%, and attenuated markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in heart and brain (GRP78, ATF6, P-PERK) by 50-75%. MI also elevated aggregate constituents enriched in Alzheimer's disease (AD) aggregates, such as proteasomal subunits, heat-shock proteins, complement C3, clusterin/ApoJ, and other apolipoproteins. These data provide novel evidence that aggregation is elevated in mouse hearts and brains after myocardial ischemia, leading to cognitive impairment resembling AD, but can be attenuated by exosomes or drug (CDN1163) interventions that oppose ER stress.\n",
      "Polyphenols are a class of secondary metabolic products found in plants that have been extensively studied for how well they regulate biological processes, such as the proliferation of cells, autophagy, and apoptosis. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated signaling cascade is currently identified as a crucial pro-inflammatory pathway that plays a significant role in the development of neuroinflammation. This process has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), CNS damage, and cerebral ischemia. Getting enough polyphenols through eating habits has resulted in mitigating the effects of oxidative stress (OS) and lowering the susceptibility to associated neurodegenerative disorders, including but not limited to multiple sclerosis (MS), AD, stroke, and PD. Polyphenols possess significant promise in dealing with the root cause of neurological conditions by modulating multiple therapeutic targets simultaneously, thereby attenuating their complicated physiology. Several polyphenolic substances have demonstrated beneficial results in various studies and are presently undergoing clinical investigation to treat neurological diseases (NDs). The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the different aspects of the MAPK pathway involved in neurological conditions, along with an appraisal of the progress made in using polyphenols to regulate the MAPK signaling system to facilitate the management of NDs.\n",

Astrocyte pyroptosis caused endothelial cell dysfunction and release of large amounts of vasoconstrictors (ET and vWF). Knockdown of GSDMD reduced astrocyte pyroptosis in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal tissue, decreased the release of inflammatory factors IL-1 β and IL-18, reduced Aβ deposition and tau protein, increased the release of peripheral vasodilator substances (eNOS), and decreased the release of vasoconstrictor substances (ET, vWF), thereby reducing brain tissue damage and vascular injury in APP/PS1 mice.\n",

      "A long-standing goal of amyloid research has been to characterize the structural basis of the rate-determining nucleating event. However, the ephemeral nature of nucleation has made this goal unachievable with existing biochemistry, structural biology, and computational approaches. Here, we addressed that limitation for polyglutamine (polyQ), a polypeptide sequence that causes Huntington's and other amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases when its length exceeds a characteristic threshold. To identify essential features of the polyQ amyloid nucleus, we used a direct intracellular reporter of self-association to quantify frequencies of amyloid appearance as a function of concentration, conformational templates, and rational polyQ sequence permutations. We found that nucleation of pathologically expanded polyQ involves segments of three glutamine (Q) residues at every other position. We demonstrate using molecular simulations that this pattern encodes a four-stranded steric zipper with interdigitated Q side chains. Once formed, the zipper poisoned its own growth by engaging naive polypeptides on orthogonal faces, in a fashion characteristic of polymer crystals with intramolecular nuclei. We further show that self-poisoning can be exploited to block amyloid formation, by genetically oligomerizing polyQ prior to nucleation. By uncovering the physical nature of the rate-limiting event for polyQ aggregation in cells, our findings elucidate the molecular etiology of polyQ diseases.\n",
      "Diseases that typically occur later in life, such as Alzheimer’s, are often caused by specific proteins clumping together into structures known as amyloids. Once the process starts, amyloids will continue to form, leading to worse symptoms that cannot be cured. The best way to treat these diseases is therefore to stop amyloids from arising in the first place. Amyloids initially develop by proteins coming together to create an unstable structure referred to as the nucleus. The instability of the nucleus means it cannot be observed directly, making it hard to study this nucleation process. To overcome this, Kandola, Venkatesan et al. investigated the simplest protein known to form an amyloid – polyglutamine, which is made up of a chain of repeating building blocks known as amino acids. Polyglutamine forms only one type of amyloid which is associated with nine neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s disease. However, it only does this when its chain of amino acids exceeds a certain length, suggesting that a specific structure may be required for nucleation to begin. Kandola, Venkatesan et al. made alternative versions of the polyglutamine protein which each contained slightly different sequences of amino acids that will alter the way the protein folds. They then tested how well these different variants could form amyloids in yeast cells. This revealed that in order to join together into a nucleus, polyglutamine needs to be able to fold into a zipper shape made up of four interlocking strands. The length of the protein required to form this shape is also the same length that causes the amyloid associated with neurodegenerative diseases\n",
      "This paper aims to establish a coupling model of neuronal populations and astrocytes and, on this basis, explore the possible mechanism of electroencephalography (EEG) slowing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the viewpoint of dynamical modeling. First and foremost, excitatory and inhibitory time constants are shown to induce the early symptoms of AD. The corresponding dynamic nature is mainly due to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the oscillatory behavior. However, there are also a few cases that can be attributed to the change of the oscillation mode caused by the limit cycle bifurcation and birhythmicity. Then, an improved neural mass model influenced by astrocytes is proposed, considering the important effects of glutamate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by astrocytes on the synaptic transmission process reported in experiments. The results show that a dysfunctional astrocyte disrupts the physiological state, causing three typical EEG slowing phenomena reported clinically: the decreased dominant frequency, the decreased rhythmic activity in the α band, and the increased rhythmic activity in the δ+θ band. In addition, astrocytes may control AD when the effect of ATP on synaptic connections is greater than that of glutamate. The control rate depends on the ratio of the effect of glutamate on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. These modeling results can not only reproduce some experimental and clinical results, but, more importantly, may offer a prediction of some underlying phenomena, helping to inspire the disease mechanisms and therapeutic methods of targeting astrocytes.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease where abnormal amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) occurs and has been linked to neuronal dysfunction. Hypometabolism of glucose in the brain can lead to synaptic loss and neuronal death, which in turn exacerbates energy deficiency and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) accumulation. Lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis serves as an energy substrate supporting neuronal function and facilitating neuronal repair. Vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4) has been recognized as a key regulator of the hypoxia-sensing pathway. However, the role of VGLL4 in AD remains unexplored. Here, we reported that the expression of VGLL4 protein was significantly decreased in the brain tissue of AD model mice and AD model cells. We further found that overexpression of VGLL4 reduced APP amyloidogenic processing and ameliorated neuronal synaptic damage. Notably, we identified a compromised hypoxia-sensitive capability of LDHA regulated by VGLL4 in the context of AD. Upregulation of VGLL4 increased the response of LDHA to hypoxia and enhanced the expression levels of LDHA and lactate by inhibiting the ubiquitination and degradation of LDHA. Furthermore, the inhibition of lactate production by using sodium oxamate, an inhibitor of LDHA, suppressed the neuroprotective function of VGLL4 by increasing APP amyloidogenic processing. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that VGLL4 exerts a neuroprotective effect by upregulating LDHA expression and consequently promoting lactate production. Thus, this study suggests that VGLL4 may be a novel player involved in molecular mechanisms relevant for ameliorating neurodegeneration.\n",

      "Amyloid-like protein assemblies have been associated with toxic phenotypes because of their repetitive and stable structure. However, evidence that cells exploit these structures to control function and activity of some proteins in response to stimuli has questioned this paradigm. How amyloid-like assembly can confer emergent functions and how cells couple assembly with environmental conditions remains unclear. Here, we study Rim4, an RNA-binding protein that forms translation-repressing assemblies during yeast meiosis. We demonstrate that in its assembled and repressive state, Rim4 binds RNA more efficiently than in its monomeric and idle state, revealing a causal connection between assembly and function. The Rim4-binding site location within the transcript dictates whether the assemblies can repress translation, underscoring the importance of the architecture of this RNA-protein structure for function. Rim4 assembly depends exclusively on its intrinsically disordered region and is prevented by the Ras/protein kinase A signaling pathway, which promotes growth and suppresses meiotic entry in yeast. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby cells couple a functional protein assembly with a stimulus to enforce a cell fate decision.\n",

      "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an important index for measuring brain function. Studies have shown that regional CBF changes inconsistently in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is widely used in the study of CBF in patients with MCI. However, alterations in CBF connectivity in these patients remain poorly understood.\n",
      "In this study, 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D-pCASL) technology was used to investigate the changes in regional CBF and CBF connectivity between 32 MCI patients and 32 healthy controls. The normalized CBF was used to reduce inter-subject variations. Both group comparisons in the CBF and correlations between CBF alterations and cognitive scores were assessed. CBF connectivity of brain regions with regional CBF differences was also compared between groups.\n",
      "We found that compared with that in controls, the CBF was significantly reduced in the left superior parietal gyrus in MCI patients, whereas it was increased in the left precentral gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right putamen, and left supplementary motor area.

Importantly, MCI patients exhibited CBF disconnections between the left supplementary motor area and the left superior parietal gyrus.\n",

BDLAS and EDLAS scores at the first and second visits showed significant associations with disease progression, while scores at the third visit did not.

      "This study aimed to understand stigma in relation to people living with dementia in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Critical Narrative Inquiry methodology was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between January and March 2020 with six people living with dementia and 15 family carers. Inductive and deductive techniques were used. The latter was informed by Link and Phelan's (2001) sociological theory of stigma. Dementia was commonly viewed by people living with dementia as part of ageing and carers reported low levels awareness about the condition. To avoid negative reactions from people, people living with dementia managed the negative views of dementia by minimising and normalising the condition, by expressing their ability to live an active life, and by emphasising the positive impacts of dementia in their lives. Fear of negative reactions appeared to lead to a selective disclosure of their diagnosis. Among carers, stigmatising attitudes coincided with a strong willingness to provide good care, to protect the person cared for, as well as to understand and validate their caring experiences, rather than to cause harm. In doing so, however, carers ended up depersonalising and infantilising people living with dementia, underestimating their capacities, demanding 'obedience', and restricting their freedom. There is a need to increase awareness about dementia and to provide support and training on person-centred care for carers in Brazil.\n",

      "The characterization of 12 AD-related CRGs was evaluated in AD, and a diagnostic model for AD showed a satisfying discrimination power based on five CRGs by LASSO regression analysis. The dysregulated CRGs and activated immune responses partially differed between patients with AD and healthy subjects. Furthermore, two molecular subtypes (clusters A and B) with different immune infiltration characteristics in AD were identified. Similarly, a diagnostic model for different AD subtypes was built with nine CRGs, which achieved a good performance. Molecular docking revealed the optimum conformation of CHEMBL261454 and its target gene CSNK1D, which was further validated by MD simulation. The RT-qPCR results were consistent with those of the comprehensive analysis.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis in its early stages remains difficult with current diagnostic approaches. Though tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) generally follow the stereotypical pattern described by the Braak staging scheme, the network degeneration hypothesis (NDH) has suggested that NFTs spread selectively along functional networks of the brain. To evaluate this, we implemented a Bayesian workflow to develop hierarchical multinomial logistic regression models with increasing levels of complexity of the brain from tau-PET and structural MRI data to investigate whether it is beneficial to incorporate network-level information into an ROI-based predictive model for the presence/absence of AD.\n",

      "The Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) estimate of the expected log pointwise predictive density (ELPD) results indicated that models 3 and 4 were substantially better than other models for both tau-PET and structural MRI inputs. For tau-PET data, model 3 was slightly better than 4 with an absolute difference in ELPD of 3.10 ± 1.30. For structural MRI data, model 4 was considerably better than other models with an absolute difference in ELPD of 29.83 ± 7.55 relative to model 3, the second-best model.\n",

      "This study aimed to investigate local and remote functional connectivity in mild Alzheimer's disease patients with sleep disturbances (ADSD) and those without sleep disturbances (ADNSD).\n",
      "Thirty eight mild AD patients with sleep disturbances and 21 mild AD patients without sleep disturbances participated in this study. All subjects underwent neuropsychological assessments and 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance scanning. Static and dynamic regional homogeneity (ReHo) were used to represent the local functional connectivity. Seed-based whole-brain functional connectivity was used to represent the remote functional connectivity. The seed was chosen based on the results of ReHo.\n",
      "Compared to ADNSD, ADSD showed decreased static ReHo in the left posterior central gyrus and the right cuneus and increased dynamic ReHo in the left posterior central gyrus. As for the remote functional connectivity, comparing ADSD to ADNSD, it was found that there was a decreased functional connection between the left posterior central gyrus and the left cuneus as well as the left calcarine.\n",
      "The current study demonstrated that, compared with ADNSD, ADSD is impaired in both local and remote functional connectivity, manifested as reduced functional connectivity involving the primary sensory network and the primary visual network. The abnormality of the above functional connectivity is one of the reasons why sleep disorders promote cognitive impairment in AD. Moreover, sleep disorders change the temporal sequence of AD pathological damage to brain functional networks, but more evidence is needed to support this conclusion.\n",
      "Biological evidence indicewates that the brain atrophy can be involved at the onset of neuropathological pathways of Alzheimer's disease. However, there is lack of formal statistical methods to perform genetic dissection of brain activation phenotypes such as shape and intensity. To this end, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model which consists of two levels of hierarchy. At level 1, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric level set (BNLS) model for studying the brain activation region shape. At level 2, we construct a regression model to select genetic variants that are strongly associated with the brain activation intensity, where a spike-and-slab prior and a Gaussian prior are chosen for feature selection. We develop efficient posterior computation algorithms based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method via extensive simulation studies and analyses of imaging genetics data in the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) study.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that progressively impairs cognitive function and memory. The occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease involves many processes. In response to the complex pathogenesis of AD, the Traditional Chinese medicine formula Liuwei Dihuang Pill (LWD) has been shown to improve the cognitive function of AD animal models. However, the active ingredients and mechanism of action of LWD have not been fully elucidated. In this study, network pharmacological analysis predicted 40 candidate compounds in LWD, acting on 227 potential targets, of which 185 were associated with AD. Through network pharmacological analysis, the mechanism of action of LWD therapy AD is related to the inhibition of inflammatory response, regulation of neuronal state, and autophagy. In this experiment, LWD was detected in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model. The objective was to observe the effects of LWD on hippocampal learning and memory ability, Aβ clearance, autophagy and inflammatory response in APP/PS1 mice. The results showed that LWD improved long-term memory and working memory in APP/PS1 mice compared with the WT group. At the same time, LWD can increase the expression of hippocampal autophagy biomarkers, reduce the precipitation of Aβ, and the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Its mechanism may be related to the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that LWD has a neuroprotective effect on APP/PS1 mice and provide theoretical foundation for the development of a new clinical treatment for AD.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, and its incidence increases yearly. Because AD patients will have cognitive impairment and personality changes, it has caused a heavy burden on the family and society. Image genetics takes the structure and function of the brain as a phenotype and studies the influence of genetic variation on the structure and function of the brain. Based on the structural magnetic resonance imaging data and transcriptome data of AD and healthy control samples in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Disease database, this paper proposed the use of an orthogonal structured sparse canonical correlation analysis for diagnostic information fusion algorithm. The algorithm added structural constraints to the region of interest (ROI) of the brain. Integrating the diagnostic information of samples can improve the correlation performance between samples. The results showed that the algorithm could extract the correlation between the two modal data and discovered the brain regions most affected by multiple risk genes and their biological significance. In addition, we also verified the diagnostic significance of risk ROIs and risk genes for AD. The code of the proposed algorithm is available at https://github.com/Wanguangyu111/OSSCCA-DIF.\n",
      "The subject of hyponatremia is undergoing significant changes after developing a more pathophysiologic approach that is superior to the ineffective volume approach and can more effectively identify the different causes of hyponatremia. This new approach identified cerebral salt wasting (CSW) in 24 (38%) of 62 hyponatremic patients from the medical wards of the hospital with 21 showing no evidence of cerebral disease to support our proposal to change CSW to renal salt wasting (RSW). RSW had to be differentiated from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) because of diametrically opposite therapeutic goals of water-restricting water-logged patients with SIADH or administering salt water to volume-depleted patients with RSW. Both syndromes present with identical clinical parameters that require a difficult protocol to make such a differentiation possible. We describe rat clearance studies demonstrating natriuretic activity in the plasma of patients with neurosurgical and Alzheimer diseases (AD) and eventually identify the protein as haptoglobin-related protein without signal peptide, which can serve as a biomarker to simplify diagnosis of RSW and delivery of the proper management to improve clinical outcomes. We also discuss the introduction of a new syndrome of RSW in AD and its implications. The high prevalence of RSW and identification of the natriuretic factor have created debates over the existence of RSW with none questioning or addressing the pathophysiologic data that identified patients with RSW. We also discuss the potentially large group of patients with RSW who are normonatremic.\n",

Male Wistar rats received streptozotocin (STZ icv, 3 mg/kg diluted in aCFS, 5 µl/ventricle) and were treated for 21 days with EXE-4 (10 µg/kg, ip; saline as the vehicle). Four groups were formed: vehicle, EXE-4, STZ, and STZ + EXE-4. The groups were submitted to Y-Maze (YM), object recognition (ORT), and object displacement tasks (ODT) to assess learning and memory. The brains were used for immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques with antibodies to NeuN, cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), PCNA, doublecortin (DCX), synaptophysin (SYP), and insulin receptor (IR). STZ worsened spatial memory in the YMT, as well as short-term (STM) and long-term (LTM) memories in the ORT and ODT, respectively. EXE-4 protected against memory impairment in STZ animals. STZ reduced mature neuron density (NeuN) and increased cell apoptosis (CC3) in the DG, CA1, and CA3. EXE-4 protected against neuronal death in all regions. EXE-4 increased PCNA\n",
      "Abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule-binding protein tau in the brain is a key pathological marker for Alzheimer's disease and additional neurodegenerative tauopathies. However, how hyperphosphorylated tau causes cellular dysfunction or death that underlies neurodegeneration remains an unsolved question critical for the understanding of disease mechanism and the design of efficacious drugs. Using a recombinant hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) synthesized by the PIMAX approach, we examined how cells responded to the cytotoxic tau and explored means to enhance cellular resistance to tau attack. Upon p-tau uptake, the intracellular calcium levels rose promptly. Gene expression analyses revealed that p-tau potently triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress-associated apoptosis, and pro-inflammation in cells. Proteomics studies showed that p-tau diminished heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an ER stress-associated anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress regulator, while stimulated the accumulation of MIOS and other proteins. p-Tau-induced ER stress-associated apoptosis and pro-inflammation are ameliorated by apomorphine, a brain-permeable prescription drug widely used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, and by overexpression of HO-1. Our results reveal probable cellular functions targeted by hyperphosphorylated tau. Some of these dysfunctions and stress responses have been linked to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The observations that the ill effects of p-tau can be mitigated by a small compound and by overexpressing HO-1 that is otherwise diminished in the treated cells inform new directions of Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.\n",
      "The mechanisms that confer cognitive resilience to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are not fully understood. Here, we describe a neural circuit mechanism underlying this resilience in a familial AD mouse model. In the prodromal disease stage, interictal epileptiform spikes (IESs) emerge during anesthesia in the CA1 and mPFC regions, leading to working memory disruptions. These IESs are driven by inputs from the thalamic nucleus reuniens (nRE). Indeed, tonic deep brain stimulation of the nRE (tDBS-nRE) effectively suppresses IESs and restores firing rate homeostasis under anesthesia, preventing further impairments in nRE-CA1 synaptic facilitation and working memory. Notably, applying tDBS-nRE during the prodromal phase in young APP/PS1 mice mitigates age-dependent memory decline. The IES rate during anesthesia in young APP/PS1 mice correlates with later working memory impairments. These findings highlight the nRE as a central hub of functional resilience and underscore the clinical promise of DBS in conferring resilience to AD pathology by restoring circuit-level homeostasis.\n",
      "Many aging individuals accumulate the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) without evidence of cognitive decline. Here we describe an integrated neurodegeneration checkpoint response to early pathological changes that restricts further disease progression and preserves cognitive function. Checkpoint activation is mediated by the REST transcriptional repressor, which is induced in cognitively-intact aging humans and AD mouse models at the onset of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) deposition and tau accumulation. REST induction is mediated by the unfolded protein response together with β-catenin signaling. A consequence of this response is the targeting of REST to genes involved in key pathogenic pathways, resulting in downregulation of gamma secretase, tau kinases, and pro-apoptotic proteins. Deletion of REST in the 3xTg and J20 AD mouse models accelerates Aβ deposition and the accumulation of misfolded and phosphorylated tau, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Conversely, viral-mediated overexpression of REST in the hippocampus suppresses Aβ and tau pathology. Thus, REST mediates a neurodegeneration checkpoint response with multiple molecular targets that may protect against the onset of AD.\n",
      "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is a rare devastating subclassification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). EOAD affects individuals <65 years old, and accounts for 5%-10% of all AD cases. Previous studies on EOAD primarily focused on familial forms, whereas research on sporadic EOAD (sEOAD), which represents 85%-90% of EOAD cases, is limited. In this prospective cohort study, participants were recruited between 2018 and 2023 and included patients with sEOAD (n = 110), late-onset AD (LOAD, n = 89), young controls (YC, n = 50), and older controls (OC, n = 25). All AD patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria based on biomarker evidence. Familial EOAD patients or non-AD dementia patients were excluded. Single molecule array technology was used to measure fluid biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) 40, Aβ42, phosphorylated tau (P-tau) 181, total tau (T-tau), serum neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Patients with sEOAD exhibited more severe executive function impairment and bilateral precuneus atrophy (P < 0.05, family-wise error corrected) than patients with LOAD. Patients with sEOAD showed elevated CSF and plasma P-tau181 levels (154.0 ± 81.2 pg/mL, P = 0.002; and 6.1 ± 2.3 pg/mL, P = 0.046). Moreover, precuneus atrophy was significantly correlated with serum GFAP levels in sEOAD (P < 0.001). Serum GFAP levels (area under the curve (AUC) = 96.0%, cutoff value = 154.3 pg/mL) displayed excellent diagnostic value in distinguishing sEOAD patients from the control group. These preliminary findings highlight the crucial role of tau protein phosphorylation in the pathogenesis and progression of sEOAD.\n",
      "The presence of protein aggregates is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Traditionally, each disease has been associated with the aggregation of specific proteins, which serve as disease-specific biomarkers. For example, aggregates of α-synuclein (α-syn) are found in α-synucleinopathies such as PD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Similarly, AD is characterized by aggregates of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins. However, it has been observed that these protein aggregates can also occur in other neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to disease progression. For instance, α-syn aggregates have been detected in AD, Down syndrome, Huntington's disease, prion diseases, and various forms of FTLD. Similarly, Aβ aggregates have been found in conditions like DLB and PD. Tau aggregates, in addition to being present in primary tauopathies, have been identified in prion diseases, α-synucleinopathies, and cognitively healthy aged subjects. Finally, aggregates of TDP-43, typically associated with FTLD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have been observed in AD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), MSA, DLB, and other neurodegenerative diseases. These findings highlight the complexity of protein aggregation in neurodegeneration and suggest potential interactions and common mechanisms underlying different diseases. A deeper understating of this complex scenario may eventually lead to the identification of a better elucidation of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these devastating conditions and hopefully new therapeutic stragegies.\n",
      "In the past 10 years, significant progress has been made in understanding the pathogenic chain of events that causes Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to the most widely accepted concept, the production and aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides play a critical role in AD. As a result, therapeutic intervention with these processes is the focus of intense research. The Aβ peptide is cleaved by the α-secretase, β-secretase, and γ-secretase enzymes in a region near the pathogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) and mutations occurring site.\n",
      "In the current review, a complete picture of the risk factors behind AD has been investigated. Mutations involved in AD progression have also been screened in various studies.\n",
      "Most of the mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) can lead to the accumulation of APP oligomers in the brain, leading to AD. Several point mutations in APP can cause familial AD (FAD), including the Swedish mutation (K>M670/671N>L) and the A673>V mutation. The pathogenic A673>V mutation and Swedish mutation (M670>K/N671>L) are present in the same region of amyloid precursor protein (\n",
      "More investigations are needed from geographically distinct regions on mutations associated with AD development and applications of nanomedicines for better management of the disease burden in the future. Nanotechnology-produced metal nanoparticles (NPs) have gotten much attention because of their wide range of uses in the medicinal and agricultural industries. Nanomedicine containing potential phytochemicals, including GX-50 and curcumin conjugated with NPs, maybe a potential candidate for treating AD.\n",
      "Tau PET has enabled the visualization of paired helical filaments of 3 or 4 C-terminal repeat tau in Alzheimer disease (AD), but its ability to detect aggregated tau in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum disorders is uncertain. We investigated 2-(2-([\n",
      "O-GlcNAc is a common modification found on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Determining the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which removes O-GlcNAc from proteins, enabled the creation of potent and selective inhibitors of this regulatory enzyme. Such inhibitors have served as important tools in helping to uncover the cellular and organismal physiological roles of this modification. Additionally, OGA inhibitors have been important for defining the augmentation of O-GlcNAc as a promising disease-modifying approach to combat several neurodegenerative diseases including both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. These studies have led to development and optimization of OGA inhibitors for clinical application. These compounds have been shown to be well tolerated in early clinical studies and are steadily advancing into the clinic. Despite these advances, the mechanisms by which O-GlcNAc protects against these various types of neurodegeneration are a topic of continuing interest since improved insight may enable the creation of more targeted strategies to modulate O-GlcNAc for therapeutic benefit. Relevant pathways on which O-GlcNAc has been found to exert beneficial effects include autophagy, necroptosis, and processing of the amyloid precursor protein. More recently, the development and application of chemical methods enabling the synthesis of homogenous proteins have clarified the biochemical effects of O-GlcNAc on protein aggregation and uncovered new roles for O-GlcNAc in heat shock response. Here, we discuss the features of O-GlcNAc in neurodegenerative diseases, the application of inhibitors to identify the roles of this modification, and the biochemical effects of O-GlcNAc on proteins and pathways associated with neurodegeneration.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, characterized by the presence of plaques of amyloid beta and Tau proteins. There is currently no permanent cure for AD; the only medications approved by the FDA for mild to moderate AD are cholinesterase inhibitors, NMDA receptor antagonists, and immunotherapies against core pathophysiology, that provide temporary relief only. Researchers worldwide have made significant attempts to find new targets and develop innovative therapeutic molecules to treat AD. The FDA-approved drugs are palliative and couldn't restore the damaged neuron cells of AD. Stem cells have self-differentiation properties, making them prospective therapeutics to treat AD. The promising results in pre-clinical studies of stem cell therapy for AD seek attention worldwide. Various stem cells, mainly mesenchymal stem cells, are currently in different phases of clinical trials and need more advancements to take this therapy to the translational level. Here, we review research from the past decade that has identified several hypotheses related to AD pathology. Moreover, this article also focuses on the recent advancement in therapeutic strategies for AD treatment including immunotherapy and stem cell therapy detailing the clinical trials that are currently undergoing development.\n",
      "In humans, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically sporadic in nature, and its pathology is usually influenced by extensive factors. The study established a rat model based on the genetic-environmental interaction.\n",
      "A rat model was established by transduction of an adeno-associated virus combined with acrolein treatment. Rats were assigned to the normal control (NC), acrolein group, AAV (-) group, AAV-APP group, and AAV-APP/acrolein group. The success of model construction was verified in multiple ways, including by assessing cognitive function, examining microstructural changes in the brain in vivo, and performing immunohistochemistry. The contribution of genetic (APP mutation) and environmental (acrolein) factors to AD-like phenotypes in the model was explored by factorial analysis.\n",
      "1) The AAV-APP/acrolein group showed a decline in cognitive function, as indicated by a reduced gray matter volume in key cognition-related brain areas, lower FA values in the hippocampus and internal olfactory cortex, and Aβ deposition in the cortex and hippocampus. 2) The AAV-APP group also showed a decline in cognitive function, although the group exhibited atypical brain atrophy in the gray matter and insignificant Aβ deposition. 3) The acrolein group did not show any significant changes in Aβ levels, gray matter volume, or cognitive function. 4) The genetic factor (APP mutation) explained 39.74% of the AD-like phenotypes in the model factors, and the environmental factor (acrolein exposure) explained 33.3%.\n",
      "The genetic-environmental interaction rat model exhibited a phenotype that resembled the features of human AD and will be useful for research on AD.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks include amyloid-βeta (Aβ) and tau proteins aggregates, neurite degeneration, microglial activation with cognitive impairment. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/Glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (PI3K/AKT/GSK-3) pathway is essential for neuroprotection, cell survival and proliferation by blocking apoptosis. This study aimed to assess protective role of nanocurcumin (NCMN) as strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent with elucidating its synergistic effects with Donepezil as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on AD in rats via modulating PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway. The experiment was performed on 70 male Wistar albino rats divided into seven groups (control, NCMN, Donepezil, AD-model, Donepezil co-treatment, NCMN only co-treatment, and NCMN+Donepezil combined treatment). Behavioral and biochemical investigations as cholinesterase activity, oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, nitric oxide, superoxidedismutase, and catalase), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Tau, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1), Glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK-3β) and toll-like receptor-4 were evaluated. Treatment with NCMN improved memory, locomotion, neuronal differentiation by activating PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway. These results were confirmed by histological studies in hippocampus.\n",
      "Autophagy is a self-degradative process important for balancing the sources of energy and involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, a number of papers have shown that elastin-derived peptides (EDPs) affect the expression and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), which is crucial for the development of AD and autophagy initiation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether EDPs with a Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly (VGVAPG) amino acid sequence activate the autophagic process in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Our study is the first to show that EDPs with the VGVAPG sequence initiate the autophagy process in the undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cell line exhibiting a number of features of normal neuroblasts. In particular, we observed in our study that VGAVPG peptide increased ULK1, AKT, PPARγ, and LC3B protein expression. Moreover, our experiments with the agonist (rosiglitazone) and antagonist (GW9662) of PPARγ confirm that the studied EDP acts through the PPARγ pathway affecting mTOR and finally autophagy. Some studies have shown that autophagy disturbances are involved in the development of AD. Therefore, we believe that our study will provide new evidence of the possible involvement of EDPs (especially VGVAPG) in the development of AD.\n",
      "Fe65 is a brain enriched adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton regulation, DNA repair and transcription. A well-studied interacting partner of Fe65 is the transmembrane amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), which can undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). Following β- and γ-secretase-mediated RIP, the released APP intracellular domain (AICD) together with Fe65 can translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription. In this study, we investigated if Fe65 nuclear localization can also be regulated by different α-secretases, also known to participate in RIP of APP and other transmembrane proteins. We found that in both Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and all-trans retinoic acid differentiated neuroblastoma cells a strong negative impact on Fe65 nuclear localization, equal to the effect observed upon γ-secretase inhibition, could be detected following inhibition of all three (ADAM9, ADAM10 and ADAM17) α-secretases. Moreover, using the comet assay and analysis of Fe65 dependent DNA repair associated posttranslational modifications of histones, we could show that inhibition of α-secretase-mediated Fe65 nuclear translocation resulted in impaired capacity of the cells to repair DNA damage. Taken together this suggests that α-secretase processing of APP and/or other Fe65 interacting transmembrane proteins play an important role in regulating Fe65 nuclear translocation and DNA repair.\n",
      "Maintaining the proteome is crucial to retaining cell functionality and response to multiple intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. Protein misfolding increased the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated the adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore cell homeostasis. Apoptosis occurs when ER stress is prolonged or the adaptive response fails. In healthy young cells, the ratio of protein folding machinery to quantities of misfolded proteins is balanced under normal circumstances. However, the age-related deterioration of the complex systems for handling protein misfolding is accompanied by ageing-related disruption of protein homeostasis, which results in the build-up of misfolded and aggregated proteins. This ultimately results in decreased cell viability and forms the basis of common age-related diseases called protein misfolding diseases. Proteins or protein fragments convert from their ordinarily soluble forms to insoluble fibrils or plaques in many of these disorders, which build up in various organs such as the liver, brain, or spleen. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type II diabetes, and cancer are diseases in this group commonly manifest in later life. Thus, protein misfolding and its prevention by chaperones and different degradation paths are becoming understood from molecular perspectives. Proteodynamics information will likely affect future interventional techniques to combat cellular stress and support healthy ageing by avoiding and treating protein conformational disorders. This review provides an overview of the diverse proteostasis machinery, protein misfolding, and ER stress involvement, which activates the UPR sensors. Here, we will discuss the crosstalk between protein misfolding and ER stress and their role in developing age-related diseases.\n",
      "Commonly occurring dementias include those of Alzheimer's, vascular, and mixtures of these and other pathologies. They are believed to evolve over many years, but that time interval has been difficult to establish. Our objective is to determine how many years in advance of a dementia diagnosis cognitive scores begin to change.\n",
      "14,086 dementia-free ARIC participants underwent a cognitive exam at baseline visit 2 (1990-1992, mean age 57±5.72), and in 11,244 at visit 4 (1996-1998), 5,640 at visit 5 (2011-2013), and 3,574 at visit 6 (2016-2017) with surveillance for dementias of all causes combined. Within 5-year intervals after each visit, we compared performance on the Delayed Word Recall Test (DWRT), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the Word Fluency Test (WFT), and the combined mean of three cognitive tests at baseline in participants who were diagnosed with dementia within each interval versus those who survived the interval without a dementia diagnosis. Z-scores were adjusted for demographics and education in separate regression models for each visit. We plotted adjusted z-score means by time interval following each visit.\n",
      "During follow-up 3,334, 2,821, 1,218, and 329 dementia cases were ascertained after visits 2, 4, 5, and 6 respectively. Adjusted DWRT z-scores were significantly lower 20-25 years before dementia than those who did not experience dementia within 25 years. DSST z-scores were significantly lower at 25-30 years and 3-test combination z-scores were significantly lower as early as 30-31 years before onset. The difference between dementia and non-dementia group in the visit 2 3-test combination z-score was -0.20 at 30-31 years prior to dementia diagnosis. As expected, differences between the dementia and non-dementia groups increased closer to the time of dementia occurrence, up to their widest point at 0-5 years prior to dementia diagnosis. The difference between dementia and non-dementia groups in the visit 2 3-test combination z-score was -0.90. WFT z-score differences were smaller than for the DSST or DWRT and began later. Patterns were similar in Black and White participants.\n",
      "DWRT, DSST and combined 3-test z-scores were significantly lower more than 20 years prior to diagnosis in the dementia group versus the non-dementia group. Findings contribute to our knowledge of the long prodromal period in Blacks and Whites.\n",
      "A peptide composed of a 36 amino acid called Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is employed in a variety of physiological processes to manage and treat conditions affecting the endocrine, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and neurological systems. NPY naturally binds to G-protein coupled receptors, activating the Y-receptors (Y1-Y5 and y6). The findings on numerous therapeutic applications of NPY for CNS disease are presented in this review by the authors. New targets for treating diseases will be revealed by medication combinations that target NPY and its receptors. This review is mainly focused on disorders such as anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Machado Joseph disease, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, depression, migraine, alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorder. The findings from the preclinical studies and clinical studies covered in this article may help create efficient therapeutic plans to treat neurological conditions on the one hand and psychiatric disorders on the other. They may also open the door to the creation of novel NPY receptor ligands as medications to treat these conditions.\n",
      "Mitochondria are the most important energy supply centers in the cell, the changes in function and structure are implicated in many diseases. Among them, Aβ peptide, one of the targets of Alzheimer's disease, is closely related to mitochondrial autophagy, during the process of mitochondrial autophagy, the mitochondrial matrix will undergo acidification and the pH will be obviously reduced. Herein, a quinolinium-based NIR fluorescent probe QM12 was rationally designed and synthesized for the simultaneous imaging of Aβ aggregates and mitochondrial pH with different emission readout. The probe QM12 exhibited excellent selective toward Aβ aggregates, and can also trace the real-time changes of mitochondrial pH, which could serve as a promising tool for the pathological study of Alzheimer's disease, especially the cross talk between different biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "The short association fibers or U-fibers travel in the superficial white matter (SWM) beneath the cortical layer. While the U-fibers play a crucial role in various brain disorders, there is a lack of effective tools to reconstruct their highly curved trajectory from diffusion MRI (dMRI). In this work, we propose a novel surface-based framework for the probabilistic tracking of fibers on the triangular mesh representation of the SWM. By deriving a closed-form solution to transform the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients of 3D fiber orientation distributions (FODs) to local coordinate systems on each triangle, we develop a novel approach to project the FODs onto the tangent space of the SWM. After that, we utilize parallel transport to realize the intrinsic propagation of streamlines on SWM following probabilistically sampled fiber directions. Our intrinsic and surface-based method eliminates the need to perform the necessary but challenging sharp turns in 3D compared with conventional volume-based tractography methods. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we performed quantitative comparisons to demonstrate the proposed algorithm can more effectively reconstruct the U-fibers connecting the precentral and postcentral gyrus than previous methods. Quantitative validations were then performed on post-mortem MRIs to show the reconstructed U-fibers from our method more faithfully follow the SWM than volume-based tractography. Finally, we applied our algorithm to study the parietal U-fiber connectivity changes in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) patients and successfully detected significant associations between U-fiber connectivity and disease severity.\n",
      "There is emerging evidence that amyloid beta protein (Aβ) and tau-related lesions in the retina are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ and hyperphosphorylated (p)-tau deposits have been described in the retina and were associated with small amyloid spots visualized by in vivo imaging techniques as well as degeneration of the retina. These changes correlate with brain amyloid deposition as determined by histological quantification, positron emission tomography (PET) or clinical diagnosis of AD. However, the literature is not coherent on these histopathological and in vivo imaging findings. One important reason for this is the variability in the methods and the interpretation of findings across different studies. In this perspective, we indicate the critical methodological deviations among different groups and suggest a roadmap moving forward on how to harmonize (i) histopathologic examination of retinal tissue; (ii) in vivo imaging among different methods, devices, and interpretation algorithms; and (iii) inclusion/exclusion criteria for studies aiming at retinal biomarker validation.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia associated with amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. Dysfunction of the neuronal clearance pathway promotes the accumulation of Aβ. The plasminogen-activating system (PAS) is controlled by various enzymes like tissue plasminogen activators (tPA). Neuronal tPA enhances the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which cleaves Aβ; this function is controlled by many inhibitors of PAS, including a plasminogen-activating inhibitor (PAI-1) and neuroserpin. Therefore, the objective of the present narrative review was to explore the potential role of tPA/neuroserpin in the pathogenesis of AD. PAI-1 activity is increased in AD, which is involved in accumulating Aβ. Progressive increase of Aβ level during AD neuropathology is correlated with the over-production of PAI-1 with subsequent reduction of plasmin and tPA activities. Reducing plasmin and tPA activities promote Aβ by reducing Aβ clearance. Neuroserpin plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD as it regulates the expression and accumulation of Aβ. Higher expression of neuroserpin inhibits the neuroprotective tPA and the generation of plasmin with subsequent reduction in the clearance of Aβ. These observations raise conflicting evidence on whether neuroserpin is neuroprotective or involved in AD progression. Thus, neuroserpin over-expression with subsequent reduction of tPA may propagate AD neuropathology.\n",
      "Increasing evidence implicates endo-lysosomal dysfunction in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 18 proteins were quantified using a mass spectrometry assay panel in the cerebrospinal fluid of 36 people with the language variant of FTD, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) (including 13 with non-fluent variant (nfvPPA), 11 with semantic variant (svPPA), and 12 with logopenic variant (lvPPA)) and 19 healthy controls. The concentrations of the cathepsins (B, D, F, L1, and Z) as well as AP-2 complex subunit beta, ganglioside GM2 activator, beta-hexosaminidase subunit beta, tissue alpha L-fucosidase, and ubiquitin were decreased in nfvPPA compared with controls. In contrast, the concentrations of amyloid beta A4 protein, cathepsin Z, and dipeptidyl peptidase 2 were decreased in svPPA compared with controls. No proteins were abnormal in lvPPA. These results indicate a differential alteration of lysosomal proteins in the PPA variants, suggesting those with non-Alzheimer's pathologies are more likely to show abnormal lysosomal function.\n",
      "Skull development coincides with the onset of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, brain-CSF perfusion, and meningeal lymphangiogenesis, processes essential for brain waste clearance. How these processes are affected by craniofacial disorders such as craniosynostosis are poorly understood. We report that raised intracranial pressure and diminished CSF flow in craniosynostosis mouse models associates with pathological changes to meningeal lymphatic vessels that affect their sprouting, expansion, and long-term maintenance. We also show that craniosynostosis affects CSF circulatory pathways and perfusion into the brain. Further, craniosynostosis exacerbates amyloid pathology and plaque buildup in Twist1+/-:5xFAD transgenic Alzheimer's disease models. Treating craniosynostosis mice with Yoda1, a small molecule agonist for Piezo1, reduces intracranial pressure and improves CSF flow, in addition to restoring meningeal lymphangiogenesis, drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes, and brain-CSF perfusion. Leveraging these findings, we show Yoda1 treatments in aged mice with reduced CSF flow and turnover improve lymphatic networks, drainage, and brain-CSF perfusion. Our results suggest CSF provides mechanical force to facilitate meningeal lymphatic growth and maintenance. Additionally, applying Yoda1 agonist in conditions with raised intracranial pressure and/or diminished CSF flow, as seen in craniosynostosis or with ageing, is a possible therapeutic option to help restore meningeal lymphatic networks and brain-CSF perfusion.\n",
      "This work reviews the growing body of interdisciplinary research on music cognition, using biomechanical, kinesiological, clinical, psychosocial, and sociological methods. The review primarily examines the relationship between temporal elements in music and motor responses under varying contexts, with considerable relevance for clinical rehabilitation. After providing an overview of the terminology and approaches pertinent to theories of rhythm and meter from the musical-theoretical and cognitive fields, this review focuses on studies on the effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation on gait, rhythmic cues' effect on the motor system, reactions to rhythmic stimuli attempting to synchronize mobility (i.e., musical embodiment), and the application of rhythm for motor rehabilitation for individuals with Parkinson's disease, stroke, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative or neurotraumatic diseases. This work ultimately bridges the gap between the musical-theoretical and cognitive science fields to facilitate innovative research in which each discipline informs the other.\n",
      "The current study analyses metastability, a feature of brain dynamics in subjects experiencing mild cognitive impairment Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) under eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions. Alzheimer's disease is a critically prolonged brain disorder that alters brain connectivity through changes in neural synchronization and desynchronization. Metastable states occur when functional connectivity patterns changes as a consequence of temporal dynamics of brain. Thus, studying metastability under EO and EC would help in understanding the cortical dynamics and its impact in early-stage Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "The study estimated metastability from three methods namely frequency variance analysis, Kuramoto order parameter and through meta-state activation patterns. Frequency variance estimated from 21 EEG channels were clustered into three regions namely anterior, central and posterior to study the regional metastability analysis. Global metastability was assessed from Kuramoto order parameter and meta-state activation patterns by collating the 21 EEG channels.\n",
      "Reduction in metastability was observed in central regions of MCI-AD subjects through the study of frequency variance analysis. There was a marked reduction in global metastability in the patient group under resting EO condition. Reduction in meta-state activation properties such as TAS complexity, modularity and leap size in MCI-AD condition under EO condition indicates an overall reduction in brain flexibility.\n",
      "Taken together, the study infers an underlying structural change in neuronal dynamics influencing the reduction of metastability under MCI-AD condition. The study further revealed that this reduction in metastability is more pronounced in EO condition.\n",

      "Among 274 participants (mean [SD] age, 59.03 [4.34] years; 6 Asian participants [2.2%]; 48 Black participants [17.5%]; 215 White participants [78.5%]; 5 multiracial participants [1.8%]), 64 participants (24.71%) were APOEε4 genotype carriers. Higher PTSD symptoms were associated with greater carotid IMT (multivariable β = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.13]; P = .03). Associations of PTSD symptoms with neurocognitive outcomes significantly varied by APOEε4 status. Among women with APOEε4, PTSD symptoms were associated with greater whole-brain WMHV (β = 0.96 [95% CI, 0.30 to 1.63]; P = .009), periventricular WMHV (β = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.24 to 1.56]; P = .02), deep WMHV (β = 1.21 [95% CI, 0.23 to 2.20]; P = .01), and frontal WMHV (β = 1.25 [95% CI, 0.05 to 2.45]; P = .04), as well as with poorer cognition, specifically attention and working memory (β = -3.37 [95% CI, -6.12 to -0.62]; P = .02), semantic fluency (β = -6.01 [95% CI, -10.70 to -1.31]; P = .01), perceptual speed (β = -12.73 [95% CI, -20.71 to -4.75]; P = .002), and processing speed (β = -11.05 [95% CI, -17.80 to -4.30]; P = .002) in multivariable models.\n",
      "In this cross-sectional study of midlife women, greater PTSD symptoms were associated with higher carotid atherosclerosis and, among women who were APOEε4 carriers, greater brain small vessel disease and poorer cognitive performance. These findings point to the adverse implications of PTSD symptoms for cardiovascular and neurocognitive health among women in midlife, particularly for women who are APOEε4 carriers.\n",
      "This study aimed to investigate the differential expression of serum microRNAs in cognitive normal subjects (NC), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the objective of identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers. A total of 320 clinical samples, including 32 MCI patients, 288 AD patients, and 288 healthy controls, were collected following international standards. The expression of microRNAs in serum was analyzed using the Agilent human microRNA oligonucleotide microarray, and bioinformatics methods were employed to predict target genes and their involvement in AD-related pathways. Among the 122 microRNAs screened, five microRNAs (hsa-miR-208a-5p, hsa-miR-125b-1-3p, hsa-miR-3194-3p, hsa-miR-4652-5p, and hsa-miR-4419a) exhibited differential expression and met quality control standards. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the target genes of these microRNAs were involved in multiple AD-related pathways, which changed with disease progression. These findings demonstrate significant differences in serum microRNA expression between NC, MCI, and AD patients. Three microRNAs were identified as potential candidates for the development of diagnostic models for MCI and AD. The results highlight the crucial role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD and provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and personalized treatment approaches for AD. This study contributes to the understanding of AD at the molecular level and offers potential avenues for early diagnosis and intervention in AD patients.\n",
      "Social cognition (SC) impairments contribute to the dependence of people with Alzheimer disease (AD), influencing their functional disability and the burden on family members and caregivers. Our objective was to longitudinally investigate the relationship between SC and cognitive and clinical variables in persons with AD and their caregivers. We also evaluated the different SC predictors from 3 perspectives: people with AD, caregivers of people with AD, and discrepancy analysis.\n",
      "In all, 137 dyads (people with AD and their caregivers) underwent 2 assessments: at baseline (M1) and after 1 year (M2). During follow-up, 58 dyads were excluded, and the study was thus concluded with 79.\n",
      "Longitudinal analysis of the people with AD showed that while some cognitive functions declined (which is consistent with disease progression), SC impairments showed a more stable pattern. Another interesting result was related to SC predictors. For people with AD, SC was associated with cognition at both time points. For caregivers, besides cognition, other predictors included reduced functional abilities and quality of life in people with AD. These results are consistent with the discrepancy predictors.\n",
      "The stable pattern in SC functioning over 12 months in AD suggests that this neurocognitive domain may be influenced more by emotional processing than by cognitive impairment. In addition, the SC predictors showed that the investigation of different points of view enables a more global understanding, contributing to better and more targeted treatment for the patient.\n",
      "The hunt for new biomarkers - for the diagnosis of subcategories of disease, or for the monitoring of the efficacy of novel therapeutics - is an increasingly relevant challenge in the current era of precision medicine. In neurodegenerative research, the aim is to look for simple tools which can predict cognitive or motor decline early, and to determine whether these can also be used to test the efficacy of new interventions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are thought to play an important role in intercellular communication and have been shown to play a vital role in a number of diseases.\n",
      "The aim of this review is to examine what we know about EVs in neurodegeneration and to discuss their potential to be diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in the future. It will cover the techniques used to isolate and study EVs and what is currently known about their presence in neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we will discuss what is required for standardization in biomarker research, and the challenges associated with using EVs within this framework.\n",
      "The technical challenges associated with isolating EVs consistently, combined with the complex techniques required for their efficient analysis, might preclude 'pure' EV populations from being used as effective biomarkers. Whilst biomarker discovery is important for more effective diagnosis, monitoring, prediction and prognosis in neurodegenerative disease, reproducibility and ease-of-use should be the priorities.\n",
      "Activation of microglia and astrocytes has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is reported to be activated in AD and involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. Moreover, amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation is detected as a characteristic pathology in the AD brain, and is known to be a substrate of TG2. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can modify cell proliferation and differentiation, and is reported to have therapeutic effects on AD pathology.\n",
      "We aimed to assess the effects of ATRA in microglia and astrocytes on TG2 expression and glial functions.\n",
      "After treatment with ATRA, TG2 expression and TG activity were assayed in both murine microglia BV-2 cells and cultured rat brain astrocytes. Endocytosis activity in BV-2 cells and Aβ aggregation by astrocytes conditioned medium were also assessed.\n",
      "In both BV-2 cells and cultured astrocytes, ATRA increased TG2 expression and TG activity. The increase was blocked by AGN194310, an RA receptor antagonist. ATRA enhanced the endocytosis activity in BV-2 cells, and the addition of AGN194310 reversed it. The addition of cystamine, a competitive TG inhibitor, also reduced ATRA-enhanced endocytosis activity. On the other hand, Aβ aggregation was potentiated by ATRA-treated astrocytes conditioned medium compared to control astrocytes conditioned medium.\n",
      "These results suggest that ATRA increased TG2 expression and TG activity via RA receptor in microglia and astrocytes. ATRA-enhanced TGs might be involved in phagocytosis and Aβ aggregation. Adequate control of TGs expression and function in microglia and astrocytes can be an important factor in AD pathology.\n",
      "Many interventions improve care and outcomes for people with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD), yet are never disseminated. Pragmatic trials facilitate the adoption and dissemination of best practices, but gaps in pragmatic outcome measurement are a critical obstacle. Our objectives are (1) to describe the development and structure of the IMbedded Pragmatic ADRD Clinical Trials Collaboratory (IMPACT) iLibrary of potential outcome measures for ADRD pragmatic trials, and (2) to assess their pragmatic characteristics.\n",
      "We identified potential outcome measures from several sources: a database of administrative and clinical outcome measures from ADRD clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, published reviews, and IMPACT pilot pragmatic trial outcome measures. The iLibrary reports (a) number of items, (b) completion time, (c) readability for diverse populations, (d) cost or copyright barriers to use, (e) method of administration, (f) assessor training burden, and (g) feasibility of data capture and interpretation in routine care; a summary of pragmatic characteristics of each outcome measure (high, moderate, low); items or descriptions of items; and links to primary citations regarding development or psychometric properties.\n",
      "We included 140 outcome measures in the iLibrary: 66 administrative (100% were pragmatic) and 74 clinical (52% were pragmatic). The most commonly addressed outcome domains from administrative assessments included physical function, quality of care or communication concerns, and psychological symptoms or distress behaviors. The most commonly addressed outcome domains from clinical assessments were psychological symptoms or distress behaviors, physical function, cognitive function, and health-related quality of life.\n",
      "Pragmatic outcome measures are brief, meaningful to diverse populations, easily scored and interpreted by clinicians, and available in electronic format for analysis. The iLibrary can facilitate the selection of measures for a wide range of outcomes relevant to people with ADRD and their care partners.\n",
      "The aim of this review was to evaluate the relationship between periodontal disease (PD) and the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to determine whether patients with PD would be at greater risk of developing AD compared to periodontally healthy subjects. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. An electronic search for cross-sectional, cohort, or case-control studies was conducted on five databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Scopus). No restrictions were applied to the language and year of publication. Exposure was PD, and the outcome of interest was the onset and/or progression of AD. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) designed for non-randomized studies. Six studies fulfilling the selection criteria were included in this systematic review. Four of the studies were of cohort design and two were of case-control design. All except one showed a significant association between PD and the risk of AD onset and progression. According to the NOS bias risk assessment, three studies were found to be of good quality, and three other cohort studies were of low quality. Data from this systematic review indicate that patients with PD present a significantly higher risk of AD compared to individuals with healthy periodontium. However, results should be interpreted with caution given the methodological limitations found. For future research, powerful and comparable epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between PD and AD.\n",

      "Genome-wide association studies were employed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing significant correlations with osteocalcin. Subsequently, A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted utilizing the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) technique to assess the causal relationship between osteocalcin and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and vascular dementia (VD). This approach aimed to minimize potential sources of confounding bias and provide more robust results. Multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was conducted to adjust for potential genetic pleiotropy.\n",
      "The study employed three SNPs, namely rs71631868, rs9271374, and rs116843408, as genetic tools to evaluate the causal association of osteocalcin with dementia. The IVW analysis indicated that osteocalcin may have a potential protective effect against AD with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.790 (95 % CI: 0.688-0.906; P < 0.001). However, no significant relationship was observed between osteocalcin and other types of dementia. Furthermore, the MVMR analysis indicated that the impact of osteocalcin on AD remained consistent even after adjusting for age-related macular degeneration and Type 2 diabetes with an OR of 0.856 (95 % CI: 0.744-0.985; P = 0.030).\n",

      "Macroautophagy/autophagy is the intracellular degradation process of cytoplasmic content and damaged organelles. Autophagy is strongly associated with the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are brain-resident macrophages, and recent studies indicate that autophagy in microglia protects neurons from neurodegeneration. Postnatal neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons from adult neural stem cells (NSCs), is impaired in AD patients as well as in AD animal models. However, the extent to which microglial autophagy influences adult NSCs and neurogenesis in AD animal models has not been studied. Here, we showed that conditional knock out (cKO) of \n",
      "Parkinson disease (PD) characterized by dopaminergic neuronal loss is caused by aggregation of misfolded SNCA/α-synuclein. We recently developed autophagy-targeting chimera (AUTOTAC), a targeted protein degradation (TPD) technology based on the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). In this study, we employed AUTOTAC to synthesize ATC161, a chimeric compound that adopts Anle138b as target-binding ligand (TBL) for SNCA aggregates. The autophagy-targeting ligand (ATL) of ATC161 was designed to allosterically activate the autophagy receptor SQSTSM1/p62 (sequestosome 1), a key step for targeting SNCA aggregates to the phagophore. The lysosomal degradation of SNCA aggregates by ATC161 acutely occurs at DC50 of 100-500 nM with no significant off-target degradation of monomeric SNCA. ATC161 protects cells from DNA and mitochondrial damage by SNCA aggregates. In PD model mice, oral administration of ATC161 decreases the level of SNCA aggregates and their propagation across brain regions, which mitigates glial inflammatory responses and improves muscle strength and locomotive activity. An Investigational New Drug (IND) was approved by the Korean Food and Drug Administration for a phase 1 clinical trial to treat PD, Alzheimer disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We suggest that AUTOTAC provides a platform for drug discovery in proteinopathies and other diseases.\n",
      "This meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for general cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to investigate the potential influential factors. A systematic literature retrieval until August 2023 was performed by searching the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Therapeutic effects of tDCS were evaluated using standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Pooled effects of tDCS on AD patients were calculated immediately after treatment and at follow-up periods. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify the potential prognostic factors. Eleven studies with 12 trials including 451 cases were included in our systemic review, in which 9 studies with 10 trials using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scales were included in the meta-analysis. tDCS significantly improved global cognition in AD immediately after the treatment (SMD, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.66; P<0.0001), but not at the shorter or longer follow-up period. Subgroup analyses suggested significant global cognitive improvement in patients receiving stimulation on temporal lobes instead of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and in cases receiving tDCS with current density ≥ 0.08 mA/cm\n",
      "Functional output of the hippocampus, a brain region subserving memory function, depends on highly orchestrated cellular and molecular processes that regulate synaptic plasticity throughout life. The structural requirements of such plasticity and molecular events involved in this regulation are poorly understood. Specific molecules, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) have been implicated in plasticity processes in the hippocampus, a role that decreases with brain aging as expression is lost. Here, we report that TIMP2 is highly expressed by neurons within the hippocampus and its loss drives changes in cellular programs related to adult neurogenesis and dendritic spine turnover with corresponding impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory. Consistent with the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the hippocampus we observe with aging, we find that TIMP2 acts to reduce accumulation of ECM around synapses in the hippocampus. Moreover, its deletion results in hindrance of newborn neuron migration through a denser ECM network. A novel conditional TIMP2 knockout (KO) model reveals that neuronal TIMP2 regulates adult neurogenesis, accumulation of ECM, and ultimately hippocampus-dependent memory. Our results define a mechanism whereby hippocampus-dependent function is regulated by TIMP2 and its interactions with the ECM to regulate diverse processes associated with synaptic plasticity.\n",
      "Medin is a common vascular amyloidogenic peptide recently implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia and its pathology remains unknown. We aim to identify changes in transcriptomic profiles and pathways in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs) exposed to medin, compare that to exposure to β-amyloid (Aβ) and evaluate protection by monosialoganglioside-containing nanoliposomes (NL). HBMVECs were exposed for 20 h to medin (5 µM) without or with Aβ(1-42) (2 µM) or NL (300 µg/mL), and RNA-seq with signaling pathway analyses were performed. Separately, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of select identified genes was done in HBMVECs treated with medin (5 µM) without or with NFκB inhibitor RO106-9920 (10 µM) or NL (300 µg/mL). Medin caused upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes that was not aggravated by Aβ42 co-treatment but reversed by NL. Pathway analysis on differentially expressed genes revealed multiple pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the nuclear factor-κB (NFkB) signaling pathways, were affected specifically by medin treatment. RO106-9920 and NL reduced medin-induced pro-inflammatory activation. Medin induced endothelial cell pro-inflammatory signaling in part via NFκB that was reversed by NL. This could have potential implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of vascular aging, AD and vascular dementia.\n",
      "The relationships of Klotho levels with cognition and dementia are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between Klotho levels and cognitive function and to determine causality between Klotho and dementia using Mendelian randomization (MR). Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014, this study consisted of 1875 older adults aged 60-79 years. Cognitive function was assessed by the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). We performed weighted multivariable-adjusted linear regression to assess the association between Klotho concentrations and cognitive function. Then, 2-sample MR was conducted to assess the causal relationship between Klotho and dementia. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis. We observed a positive association between serum Klotho concentrations and the results of the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST) (T2: β 2.16, 95% CI: 0.30-4.01, P = 0.03, T3: β 2.48, 95% CI: 0.38-4.57, P = 0.02) after adjusting for the covariates. Moreover, there was also a potential nonlinear relationship between Klotho and DSST. The IVW method showed that genetically predicted high Klotho levels were not significantly associate with any type of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.96-1.10, P = 0.46), vascular dementia (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.87-1.25, P = 0.66), frontotemporal dementia (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.47-1.14, P = 0.16), or dementia with Lewy bodies (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.87-1.23, P = 0.73). In the cross-sectional observational study, Klotho and cognitive function were significantly correlated; however, findings from MR studies did not indicate a causal relationship between Klotho and dementia.\n",
      "Isoflavones and their derivatives possess neuroprotective activities against neurological disorders. Recently, the active compound SPA1413 (dehydroequol) derived from S-equol, an isoflavone-derived metabolite produced by human intestinal bacteria, was identified as a potent anti-amyloidogenic and neuroinflammatory candidate against Alzheimer's disease. However, its detailed modes of action, associated signaling pathways, and comparison with potential isoflavone derivatives have not yet been studied. Hence, the current study aimed to identify signaling pathways associated with SPA1413 using lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated BV2 cells as the experimental model via biological assays, Western blotting, and quantitative (q)RT-PCR. The results indicate that the SPA1413 anti-neuroinflammatory effect arises due to suppression of the nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling networks, including those of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Interestingly, SPA1413 inhibited IL-11 through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. In addition, SPA1413 inhibited neuronal cell death by reducing LPS-activated microglia in neuronal N2a cells. Our findings suggest that SPA1413 may act as a strong anti-neuroinflammatory candidate by suppressing the MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia represent major public health challenges but effective therapeutic options are limited. Pathological brain aging is associated with microvascular changes and impaired clearance systems. The application of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 or omega-3 PUFAs) is one of the most promising nutritional interventions in neurodegenerative disorders from epidemiological data, clinical and pre-clinical studies. As essential components of neuronal membranes, n-3 PUFAs have shown neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as modulatory effects through microvascular pathophysiology, amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance and glymphatic pathways. This review meticulously explores these underlying mechanisms that contribute to the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs against AD and dementia, synthesizing evidence from both animal and interventional studies.\n",
      "Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) HS72 is a catalytic antibody that specifically degrades amyloid β-protein 1-42 (Aβ42) aggregates in vitro or reduces the level or burden of Aβ42 deposits/plaques in the brains of mice with Alzheimer disease pathology. Its efficacy has been shown in protecting neural cells in vitro and improving the morphology of the cell population in the brain of mice with AD pathology (AD mice). Matrine (Mat) is a natural product capable of binding to Aβ42 or its aggregates and blocking their neurotoxicity at concentrations of at least 10 μM or greater. However, this study revealed a synergistic effect of Mat on the catalytic effect of HS72 at low concentrations (0.01-2.5 μM). This is evidenced by the fact that Mat synergistically enhances HS72's ability to degrade Aβ42 aggregates and protect neural cells (SH-SY5Y and HT22 cells, and brain cells of AD mice). The molecular docking models and characterization of Mat's action both indicated that the mechanism of Mat's synergistic impact on HS72 catalysis is to increase the turnover number (or molecular activity) of HS72 by enhancing the catalytic power of the HS72's catalytic groups and encouraging the release of the degradation products (Aβ fragments). The study's results suggest a natural synergy between Mat-like small molecules and the catalytic anti-oligomeric Aβ42 antibody HS72, enabling more effective reduction or removal of Aβ42 aggregates or plaques than the antibody alone. These findings provide novel insights into the effectiveness of anti-oligomeric Aβ42 antibodies in AD immunotherapy.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in aged populations. Aberrant amyloid-beta accumulation is a common pathological feature in AD patients. Dysfunction of autophagy and impairment of α7nAChR functioning are associated with enhanced amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation in AD patients. Hesperidin, a flavone glycoside found primarily in citrus species, is known to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of hesperidin as an antiaging and anti-Aβ phytochemical were unclear. In this study, we found that hesperidin upregulates the acr-16 expression level in C. elegans as evidenced by increased GFP-tagged ACR-16 and GFP-tagged pmyo-3:ACR-16 expression in muscle and ventral cord. Further, hesperidin upregulates the autophagy genes in wild-type N2, evident by increased GFP-tagged LGG-1 foci. However, hesperidin failed to upregulate the autophagy genes level in acr-16 mutant worms that suggests autophagy activation is mediated through acr-16. In addition, hesperidin showed antiaging and anti-oxidative effects, as evidenced by positive changes in different markers necessary for health span and lifespan. Additionally, hesperidin could upregulate acr-16 and autophagy genes (lgg-1 & bec-1) and ameliorates Aβ-induced toxicity as observed with reduce ROS accumulation, paralysis rate, and enhanced lifespan even in worms AD model CL4176 and CL2006 strain. Our finding suggests that hesperidin significantly enhances oxidative stress resistance, prolongs the lifespan, and protects against Aβ-induced toxicity in C. elegans. acr-16 mediated autophagy and antioxidation is associated with anti-aging and anti-Aβ effect of hesperidin.\n",
      "Beside its involvement in somatic dysfunctions, altered insulin signalling constitutes a risk factor for the development of mental disorders like Alzheimer's disease and obsessive-compulsive disorder. While insulin-related somatic and mental disorders are often comorbid, the fundamental mechanisms underlying this association are still elusive. Studies conducted in rodent models appear well suited to help decipher these mechanisms. Specifically, these models are apt to prospective studies in which causative mechanisms can be manipulated via multiple tools (e.g., genetically engineered models and environmental interventions), and experimentally dissociated to control for potential confounding factors. Here, we provide a narrative synthesis of preclinical studies investigating the association between hyperglycaemia - as a proxy of insulin-related metabolic dysfunctions - and impairments in working and spatial memory, and attention. Ultimately, this review will advance our knowledge on the role of glucose metabolism in the comorbidity between somatic and mental illnesses.\n",
      "With the deepening of population aging, the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia is facing increasing challenges. Vascular dementia (VaD) is a cognitive dysfunction caused by brain blood flow damage and one of the most common causes of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. White matter damage in patients with chronic ischemic dementia often occurs before cognitive impairment, and its pathological changes include leukoaraiosis, myelin destruction and oligodendrocyte death. The pathophysiology of vascular dementia is complex, involving a variety of neuronal and vascular lesions. The current proposed mechanisms include calcium overload, oxidative stress, nitrative stress and inflammatory damage, which can lead to hypoxia-ischemia and demyelination. Oligodendrocytes are the only myelinating cells in the central nervous system and closely associated with VaD. In this review article, we intend to further discuss the role of oligodendrocytes in white matter and myelin injury in VaD and the development of anti-myelin injury target drugs.\n",
      "In aging, olfactory deficits have been associated with lower cognition and motor function. Olfactory dysfunction is also one of the earliest features of neurodegenerative disease. A comprehensive review of the neural correlates of olfactive function may reveal mechanisms underlying the associations among olfaction, cognition, motor function, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we summarize existing knowledge on the relationship between brain structural and functional measures and olfaction in older adults without and with cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's disease. We identified 33 eligible studies (30 MRI/DTI,3 fMRI); 31 were cross-sectional, most assessed odor identification, and few examined multiple brain areas. Lower olfactory function was associated with smaller volumes in the temporal lobe (hippocampus,parahippocampal gyrus,fusiform gyrus), olfactory-related regions (piriform cortex,amygdala,entorhinal cortex), pre- and postcentral gyri, and globus pallidus. During aging, olfactory impairment may be associated with pathology in brain areas important for motor function and cognition, especially memory. Future longitudinal studies that include neuroimaging across different brain areas are warranted to determine the neurobiological changes underlying olfactory changes in the aging brain and the progression of neurodegeneration.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder predominantly affecting the elderly. While conventional pharmacological therapies remain the primary treatment for AD, their efficacy is limited effectiveness and often associated with significant side effects. This underscores the urgent need to explore alternative, non-pharmacological interventions. Oxidative stress has been identified as a central player in AD pathology, influencing various aspects including amyloid-beta metabolism, tau phosphorylation, autophagy, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic dysfunction. Among the emerging non-drug approaches, hydrogen therapy has garnered attention for its potential in mitigating these pathological conditions. This review provides a comprehensively overview of the therapeutic potential of hydrogen in AD. We delve into its mechanisms of action, administration routes, and discuss the current challenges and future prospects, with the aim of providing valuable insights to facilitate the clinical application of hydrogen-based therapies in AD management.\n",
      "Prior work in the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) identified impaired cognition in cross-sectional analyses and more rapid memory decline in individuals with evidence of prior common infectious disease exposures. In this study, we sought to determine the cross-sectional relationship between prior exposure to cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori and three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signatures (whole-brain cortical thickness, a previously validated AD signature, and hippocampal volume) in 455 NOMAS participants. We performed confounder-adjusted linear regression analyses between neuroimaging scores and both continuous serologies and categorical seropositivity of each pathogen, as well as a combined infectious burden index (IBI). We identified that increased serologic titers of herpes simplex virus 2 were associated with reduced whole-brain cortical thickness, and a combined score of HSV-2 and C. pneumoniae displayed an additive effect on reduced cortical thickness. Our findings suggest herpes simplex virus 2 seropositivity may contribute to accelerated brain aging, possibly resulting in an increased vulnerability to cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disease in aging populations.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and functional impairments. Two of 3 patients with AD are biologically female; therefore, the biological underpinnings of this diagnosis disparity may inform interventions slowing the AD progression. To bridge this gap, we conducted analyses of 1078 male and female participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to examine associations between levels of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)/neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive/functional outcomes. The Chow test was used to quantify sex differences by determining if biological sex affects relationships between the studied biomarkers and outcomes. Multiple magnetic resonance imaging (whole brain, entorhinal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, hippocampus), position emission tomography (AV45), and CSF (P-TAU, TAU) biomarkers were differentially associated with cognitive and functional outcomes. Post-hoc bootstrapped and association analyses confirmed these differential effects and emphasized the necessity of using separate, sex-stratified models. The studied imaging/CSF biomarkers may account for some of the sex-based variation in AD pathophysiology. The identified sex-varying relationships between CSF/imaging biomarkers and cognitive/functional outcomes warrant future biological investigation in independent cohorts.\n",
      "Salvianolic acid B (SalB) is a bioactive extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza with the ability to ameliorate amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms of this action have not been elucidated. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether the neuroprotective effect of SalB is attributable to the modulation of microglial polarization and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation.\n",
      "Based on the TMT-labeled proteomics analysis, immunofluorescence, western blot and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were employed to investigate the effects of SalB on neuroinflammation in Aβ1-42-stimulated BV2 microglia cells.\n",
      "At the proteomic level, a total of 6631 proteins were quantified, and of these, 104 were significantly influenced under Aβ1-42 treatment. The expression of 36 Aβ1-42-induced differentially expressed proteins were significantly recovered by SalB treatment (13 upregulated and 23 downregulated). NLRP3 was significantly recovered and was identified as one of the hub proteins. Consistent with the result of the proteomic analysis, western blot and qRT-PCR demonstrated that SalB reduced Aβ1-42-induced NLRP3 upregulation at both the protein and mRNA levels. In addition, SalB significantly blocked M1 microglia polarization, enhanced M2 microglial polarization, and inhibited the production of caspase-1 and interleukin-1β in BV2 microglia cells.\n",
      "our study demonstrated, for the first time, that the anti-inflammatory effects of SalB were mediated by the regulation of NLRP3 activation and promotion of microglial M2 polarization, indicating the potential of SalB as a novel therapeutic candidate for AD.\n",
      "Development of Multitarget-Directed Ligands (MTDLs) is a promising approach to combat the complex etiologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a new series of 1,4-bisbenzylpiperazine-2-carboxylic acid derivatives 3-5(a-g), 7a-f, 8a-s, and their piperazine-2-yl-1,3,4-oxadiazole analogs 6a-g. In vitro inhibitory effect against Electrophorus electricus acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) from Equine serum was evaluated using modified Ellman's method, considering donepezil and tacrine as reference drugs. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis of the results proved competitive inhibition of AChE and BChE with Ki values, in low micromolar range. The free carboxylic acid series 4a-g showed enhanced selectivity for AChE. Hence, 4c, 1,4-bis (4-chlorobenzyl)-piperazinyl-2-carboxylic acid), was the most active member of this series (Ki (AChE) = 10.18 ± 1.00 µM) with clear selectivity for AChE (SI ∼ 17.90). However, the hydroxamic acids 7a-f and carboxamides 8a-s congeners were more potent and selective inhibitors of BChE (SI ∼ 5.38 - 21862.5). Extraordinarily, 1,4-bis (2-chlorobenzyl)-piperazinyl-2-hydroxamic acid 7b showed promising inhibitory activity against BChE enzyme (Ki = 1.6 ± 0.08 nM, SI = 21862.5), that was significantly superior to that elicited by donepezil (Ki = 12.5 ± 2.6 µM) and tacrine (Ki = 17.3 ± 2.3 nM). Cytotoxicity assessment of 4c and 7b, on human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines, revealed lower toxicity than staurosporine and was nearly comparable to that of donepezil. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation afforded unblemished insights into the structure-activity relationships for AChE and BChE inhibition. The results showed stable binding with fair H-bonding, hydrophobic and/or ionic interactions to the catalytic and peripheral anionic sites of the enzymes. In silico predicted ADME and physicochemical properties of conjugates showed good CNS bioavailability and safety parameters. In this regard, compound (7b) might be considered as a promising inhibitor of BChE with an innovative donepezil-based anti-Alzheimer activity. Further assessments of the most potent AChE and BChE inhibitors as potential MTDLs anti-Alzheimer's agents are under investigation with our research group and will be published later.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, disproportionately affecting women in disease prevalence and progression. Comprehensive analysis of the serum proteome in a common AD mouse model offers potential in identifying possible AD pathology- and gender-associated biomarkers. Here, we introduce a multiplexed, nondepleted mouse serum proteome profiling via tandem mass-tag (TMTpro) labeling. The labeled sample was separated into 475 fractions using basic reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), which were categorized into low-, medium-, and high-concentration fractions for concatenation. This concentration-dependent concatenation strategy resulted in 128 fractions for acidic RPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis, collecting ∼5 million MS/MS scans and identifying 3972 unique proteins (3413 genes) that cover a dynamic range spanning at least 6 orders of magnitude. The differential expression analysis between wild type and the commonly used AD model (5xFAD) mice exhibited minimal significant protein alterations. However, we detected 60 statistically significant (FDR < 0.05), sex-specific proteins, including complement components, serpins, carboxylesterases, major urinary proteins, cysteine-rich secretory protein 1, pregnancy-associated murine protein 1, prolactin, amyloid P component, epidermal growth factor receptor, fibrinogen-like protein 1, and hepcidin. The results suggest that our platform possesses the sensitivity and reproducibility required to detect sex-specific differentially expressed proteins in mouse serum samples.\n",
      "Berberis lycium is an indigenous plant of Pakistan that is known for its medicinal properties. In the current study, we investigated the anti-Alzheimer's effect of berberine isolated from Berberis lycium.\n",
      "Root extract of B. lycium was subjected to acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay and column chromatography for bioassays guided isolation of a compound. The neuroprotective and memory improving effects of isolated compound were evaluated by aluminium chloride induced Alzheimer's disease rat model, elevated plus maze (EPM) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests., Levels of dopamine and serotonin in rats brains were determined using HPLC. Moreover, western blot and docking were performed to determine interaction between berberine and β-secretase.\n",
      "During fractionation, ethyl acetate and methanol (3:7) fraction was collected from solvent mixture of ethyl acetate and methanol. This fraction showed the highest anti-acetylcholinesterase activity and was alkaloid positive. The results of TLC and HPLC analysis indicated the presence of the isolated compound as berberine. Additionally, the confirmation of isolated compound as berberine was carried out using FTIR and NMR analysis. In vivo EPM and MWM tests showed improved memory patterns after berberine treatment in Alzheimer's disease model. The levels of dopamine, serotonin and activity of antioxidant enzymes were significantly (p<0.05) enhanced in brain tissue homogenates of berberine treated group. This was supported by decreased expression of β-secretase in berberine treated rat brain homogenates and good binding affinity of berberine with β-secretase in docking studies. Binding energies for interaction of β-secretase with berberine and drug Rivastigmine is -7.0 kcal/mol and -5.8 kcal/mol respectively representing the strong interactions. The results of docked complex of secretase with berberine and Rivastigmine was carried out using Gromacs which showed significant stability of complex in terms of RMSD and radius of gyration. Overall, the study presents berberine as a potential drug against Alzheimer's disease by providing evidence of its effects in improving memory, neurotransmitter levels and reducing β-secretase expression in the Alzheimer's disease model.\n",
      "Natural visual experience involves a continuous series of related images while the subject is immobile. How does the cortico-hippocampal circuit process a visual episode? The hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory, but most rodent single unit studies require spatial exploration or active engagement. Hence, we investigated neural responses to a silent movie (Allen Brain Observatory) in head-fixed mice without any task or locomotion demands, or rewards. Surprisingly, a third (33%, 3379/10263) of hippocampal -dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1 and subiculum- neurons showed movie-selectivity, with elevated firing in specific movie sub-segments, termed movie-fields, similar to the vast majority of thalamo-cortical (LGN, V1, AM-PM) neurons (97%, 6554/6785). Movie-tuning remained intact in immobile or spontaneously running mice. Visual neurons had >5 movie-fields per cell, but only ~2 in hippocampus. The movie-field durations in all brain regions spanned an unprecedented 1000-fold range: from 0.02s to 20s, termed mega-scale coding. Yet, the total duration of all the movie-fields of a cell was comparable across neurons and brain regions. The hippocampal responses thus showed greater continuous-sequence encoding than visual areas, as evidenced by fewer and broader movie-fields than in visual areas. Consistently, repeated presentation of the movie images in a fixed, but scrambled sequence virtually abolished hippocampal but not visual-cortical selectivity. The preference for continuous, compared to scrambled sequence was eight-fold greater in hippocampal than visual areas, further supporting episodic-sequence encoding. Movies could thus provide a unified way to probe neural mechanisms of episodic information processing and memory, even in immobile subjects, across brain regions, and species.\n",
      "Approximately one-third of patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis who are scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have some degree of cognitive impairment. TAVI may have negative cognitive effects due to periprocedural micro-emboli inducing cerebral infarction. On the contrary, TAVI may also have positive cognitive effects due to increases in cardiac output and cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, studies that systematically assess these effects are scarce. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to assess cerebral and cognitive outcomes in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing TAVI.\n",
      "In the prospective CAPITA (CArdiac OutPut, Cerebral Blood Flow and Cognition In Patients With Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) study, cerebral and cognitive outcomes are assessed in patients undergoing TAVI. One day before and 3 months after TAVI, patients will undergo echocardiography (cardiac output, valve function), brain magnetic resonance imaging (CBF, structural lesions) and extensive neuropsychological assessment. To assess longer-term effects of TAVI, patients will again undergo echocardiography and neuropsychological assessment 1 year after the procedure. The co-primary outcome measures are change in CBF (in ml/100 g per min) and change in global cognitive functioning (Z-score) between baseline and 3‑month follow-up. Secondary objectives include change in cardiac output, white matter hyperintensities and other structural brain lesions. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05481008) CONCLUSION : The CAPITA study is the first study designed to systematically assess positive and negative cerebral and cognitive outcomes after TAVI. We hypothesise that TAVI improves cardiac output, CBF and cognitive functioning.\n",

      "Eye movement data of 65 AD patients were compared between the depressed AD (D-AD) and non-depressed AD (nD-AD) groups. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify diagnostic biomarkers and the ROC curve was plotted. The correlation between eye movement and HAMD-17 scores was assessed by partial correlation analysis.\n",
      "The D-AD patients showed longer saccade latency and faster average/peak saccade velocities in the overlap prosaccade test, longer average reaction time and faster average saccade velocity in the gap prosaccade test, longer start-up durations, slower pursuit velocity, more offsets, and larger total offset degrees in the smooth pursuit test, and poorer fixation stability in both the central and lateral fixation tests compared to nD-AD patients. The start-up duration in the smooth pursuit test and the number of offsets in the central fixation test were identified as the diagnostic eye movement parameters for D-AD patients with the area under the ROC curves of 0.8011. Partial correlation analysis revealed that the start-up duration and pursuit velocity in the smooth pursuit test and the total offset degrees in the lateral fixation test were correlated with HAMD-17 scores in D-AD patients.\n",
      "Eye movement differences may help to differentiate D-AD patients from nD-AD patients in a non-invasive and cost-effective manner.\n",
      "Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. This neurodegenerative disease is characterized by progressive and irreversible damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerves, which can lead to permanent loss of peripheral and central vision. To date, maintaining long-term survival of RGCs using traditional treatments, such as medication and surgery, remains challenging, as these do not promote optic nerve regeneration. Therefore, it is of great clinical and social significance to investigate the mechanisms of optic nerve degeneration in depth and find reliable targets to provide pioneering methods for the prevention and treatment of glaucoma. Regulated necrosis is a form of genetically programmed cell death associated with the maintenance of homeostasis and disease progression in vivo. An increasing body of innovative evidence has recognized that aberrant activation of regulated necrosis pathways is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and glaucoma, resulting in unwanted loss of neuronal cells and function. Among them, ferroptosis and pyroptosis are newly discovered forms of regulated cell death actively involved in the pathophysiological processes of RGCs loss and optic nerve injury. This was shown by a series of in vivo and in vitro studies, and these mechanisms have been emerging as a key new area of scientific research in ophthalmic diseases. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and pyroptosis and their regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, with the aim of exploring their implications as potential therapeutic targets and providing new perspectives for better clinical decision-making in glaucoma treatment.\n",

      "Despite advances toward understanding the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it remains unclear which aspects of this disease are affected by environmental factors. Chronic life stress increases risk for aging-related diseases including AD. The impact of stress on tauopathies remains understudied. We examined the effects of stress elicited by social (chronic subordination stress, CSS) or psychological/physical (chronic restraint stress, CRS) factors - on the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy.\n",
      "Male PS19 mice (average age 6.3 months) were randomized to receive CSS, CRS, or to remain as singly-housed controls. Behavioral tests were used to assess anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive functions. Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting analysis were used to measure levels of astrogliosis, microgliosis and tau burden. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess glucocorticoid receptor expression.\n",
      "PS19 mice exhibit neuroinflammation (GFAP, t-tests; p = 0.0297; Iba1, t-tests; p = 0.006) and tau hyperphosphorylation (t-test, p = 0.0446) in the hippocampus, reduced anxiety (post hoc, p = 0.046), and cognitive deficits, when compared to wild type mice. Surprisingly, CRS reduced hippocampal levels of both total tau and phospho-tauS404 (t-test, p = 0.0116), and attenuated some aspects of both astrogliosis and microgliosis in PS19 mice (t-tests, p = 0.068 to p = 0.0003); however, this was not associated with significant changes in neurodegeneration or cognitive function. Anxiety-like behaviors were increased by CRS (post hoc, p = 0.046). Conversely, CSS impaired spatial learning in Barnes Maze without impacting tau phosphorylation or neurodegeneration and having a minimal impact on gliosis.\n",

      "A progressive aggregation of misfolded proteins is a hallmark of numerous pathologies including diabetes Type 2, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. As a result, highly toxic protein aggregates, which are known as amyloid fibrils, are formed. A growing body of evidence suggests that phospholipids can uniquely alter the secondary structure and toxicity of amyloid aggregates. However, the role of phosphatidic acid (PA), a unique lipid that is responsible for cell signaling and activation of lipid-gated ion channels, in the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of the length and degree of unsaturation of fatty acids (FAs) in PA in the structure and toxicity of lysozyme fibrils formed in the presence of this lipid. We found that both the length and saturation of FAs in PA uniquely altered the secondary structure of lysozyme fibrils. However, these structural differences in PA caused very little if any changes in the morphology of lysozyme fibrils. We also utilized cell toxicity assays to determine the extent to which the length and degree of unsaturation of FAs in PA altered the toxicity of lysozyme fibrils. We found that amyloid fibrils formed in the presence of PA with C18:0 FAs exerted significantly higher cell toxicity compared to the aggregates formed in the presence of PA with C16:0 and C18:1 FAs. These results demonstrated that PA can be an important player in the onset and spread of amyloidogenic diseases.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, demands effective medication to alleviate symptoms. This study focused on sleep impairment as an overt clinical symptom and tauopathy as a prominent molecular symptom of this disease. Multiple compounds from three biomolecule libraries (719 compounds; ChemDiv:366 - ChEMBL:180 - PubChem:173) were evaluated for potential binding affinity and safety using AutoDock Vina and pkCSM, respectively, resulting in the selection of four candidate compounds (Lestaurtinib, Repotrectinib, Bemcentinib, and Zotiraciclib). Due to the similarity of Repotrectinib and Bemcentinib binding sites to ATP, 300 ns Martini 3 coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) was performed on these two molecules and ATP by NAMD. The stability of tau protein in the presence of drugs was assessed using a 200 ns Martini 3 MD simulation. Binding site analysis discloses Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib as two inhibitors occupying most amino acids in binding with ATP. The RMSD and RMS average correlation results revealed protein containing Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib to have a more stable state compared to ATP in the first 220 ns simulation. There was only a single detachment of Bemcentinib, while Repotrictinib detached twice at the end of the simulation. Eventually, adding Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib to the enzyme-tau complex significantly increased the number of tau detachments during the 200 ns simulation. We report Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib, formerly prescribed for cancer, as potential inhibitors of the CK1 δ. Besides their high binding affinity compared to ATP, they can inhibit all ATP-binding sites and alter the tau binding stability.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.\n",

      "Brain disorders comprise several psychiatric and neurological disorders which can be characterized by impaired cognition, mood alteration, psychosis, depressive episodes, and neurodegeneration. Clinical diagnoses primarily rely on a combination of life history information and questionnaires, with a distinct lack of discriminative biomarkers in use for psychiatric disorders. Symptoms across brain conditions are associated with functional alterations of cognitive and emotional processes, which can correlate with anatomical variation; structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the brain are therefore an important focus of research, particularly for predictive modelling. With the advent of large MRI data consortia (such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) facilitating a greater number of MRI-based classification studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-deep learning models well suited to image processing tasks-have become increasingly popular for research into brain conditions. This has resulted in a myriad of studies reporting impressive predictive performances, demonstrating the potential clinical value of deep learning systems. However, methodologies can vary widely across studies, making them difficult to compare and/or reproduce, potentially limiting their clinical application. Here, we conduct a qualitative systematic literature review of 55 studies carrying out CNN-based predictive modelling of brain disorders using MRI data and evaluate them based on three principles-modelling practices, transparency, and interpretability. We propose several recommendations to enhance the potential for the integration of CNNs into clinical care.\n",
      "White matter abnormalities, related to poor cerebral perfusion, are a core feature of small vessel cerebrovascular disease, and critical determinants of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Despite this importance there is a lack of treatment options. Proliferation of microglia producing an expanded, reactive population and associated neuroinflammatory alterations have been implicated in the onset and progression of cerebrovascular white matter disease, in patients and in animal models, suggesting that targeting microglial proliferation may exert protection. Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) is a key regulator of microglial proliferation. We found that the expression of CSF1R/Csf1r and other markers indicative of increased microglial abundance are significantly elevated in damaged white matter in human cerebrovascular disease and in a clinically relevant mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular cognitive impairment. Using the mouse model, we investigated long-term pharmacological CSF1R inhibition, via GW2580, and demonstrated that the expansion of microglial numbers in chronic hypoperfused white matter is prevented. Transcriptomic analysis of hypoperfused white matter tissue showed enrichment of microglial and inflammatory gene sets, including phagocytic genes that were the predominant expression modules modified by CSF1R inhibition. Further, CSF1R inhibition attenuated hypoperfusion-induced white matter pathology and rescued spatial learning impairments and to a lesser extent cognitive flexibility. Overall, this work suggests that inhibition of CSF1R and microglial proliferation mediates protection against chronic cerebrovascular white matter pathology and cognitive deficits. Our study nominates CSF1R as a target for the treatment of vascular cognitive disorders with broader implications for treatment of other chronic white matter diseases.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative sickness and increasing with age throughout the world. A substantial body of evidence suggests the role of exosomal noncoding ribonucleic acids in the development of Alzheimer's disease, but the regulatory mechanisms mediated by these noncoding ribonucleic acids remain extensively unknown. Using plasma samples from Alzheimer's disease patients, this study explored the exosomal circular ribonucleic acid-microribonucleic acid profiles.\n",
      "The ArrayExpress platform was used to convey data from 3 samples from each group (healthy, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease). Using plasma exosomes, differentially expressed microribonucleic acids and differentially expressed circular ribonucleic acids were compared between the Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment groups. Afterward, to define pathways, gene ontologies, and networks, differentially expressed microribonucleic acids and differentially expressed circular ribonucleic acids common to both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups were analyzed. Eventually, the selection of hub genes and protein-protein interaction network was analyzed.\n",
      "A total of common 19 (7 upregulated and 12 downregulated) differentially expressed microribonucleic acids and 24 differentially expressed circular ribonucleic acids were recognized. A total of 4559 target genes were predicted for upregulated differentially expressed microribonucleic acids, while 6504 target genes were identified for downregulated differentially expressed microribonucleic acids, and most of the target genes involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinases-Akt pathway and that were mostly regulated by hsa-mir-374a-3p, mir-196a-5p, let-205-5p, mir-185-3p, mir-374a-5p, mir-615-3p, let-7c-5p, mir-185-5p. Additionally, 9 hub genes (HSP90AA, ACTB, MAPK1, GSK3B, CCNE2, CDK6, AKT1, IGF1R, CCND1) were revealed as the genes considerably related to Alzheimer's disease by a protein-protein interaction network using the cytohubba in Cytoscape software.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical cognitive disorder with an increasing incidence in recent years. AD is also one of the main causes of disability and death of the elderly in current aging society. One of the most common symptoms of AD is spatial memory impairment, which occurs in more than 60% of patients. This memory loss is closely related to the impairment of cognitive maps in the brain. The entorhinal grid cells and the hippocampal place cells are important cellular basis for spatial memory and navigation functions in the brain. Understanding the abnormal firing pattern of these neurons and their impaired coordination to neural oscillations in transgenic rodents is crucial for identifying the therapeutic targets for AD. In this article, we review recent studies on neural activity based on transgenic rodent models of AD, with a focus on the changes in the firing characteristics of neurons and the abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. We also discuss potential cell-network mechanism of spatial memory disorders caused by AD, so as to provide a scientific basis for the diagnosis and treatment of AD in the future.\n",

We found that performance in a hippocampus-dependent memory task was impaired in young adult and aged mutant mice. In both age groups, we then recorded from the CA1 region, which receives inputs from APP-expressing CA3 cells. We observed that theta oscillation frequency in CA1 was reduced along with disrupted relative timing of principal cells. Highly localized pathology limited to the presynaptic CA3 cells is thus sufficient to cause aberrant firing patterns in postsynaptic neuronal networks, which indicates that disease progression is not only from spreading pathology but also mediated by progressively advancing physiological dysfunction.\n",
      "Studies have shown a close relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the causal relationship between them remains unclear.\n",
      "We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using publicly available summary statistics data for GM and AD. We extracted independent genetic loci significantly associated with GM relative abundances as instrumental variables based on predefined thresholds (\n",

      "This study provided a comprehensive analysis of the causal relationship between 211 GM taxa and AD. It discerned distinct GM taxa linked to the susceptibility of AD, thereby providing novel perspectives on the genetic mechanisms governing AD via the GM. Additionally, these discoveries held promise as valuable biomarkers, enabling the identification of potential therapeutic targets and guiding forthcoming AD investigations.\n",
      "Recent clinical data with three therapeutic anti-Aβ antibodies have demonstrated that removal of Aβ-amyloid plaques in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) can attenuate disease progression. This ground-breaking progress in AD medicine has validated both the amyloid cascade hypothesis and Aβ-amyloid as therapeutic targets. These results also strongly support therapeutic approaches that aim to reduce the production of amyloidogenic Aβ to prevent the formation of Aβ-pathology. One such strategy, so-called gamma-secretase modulators (GSM), has been thoroughly explored in preclinical settings but has yet to be fully tested in clinical trials. Recent scientific progress has shed new light on the role of Aβ in Alzheimer's disease and suggests that GSMs exhibit specific pharmacological features that hold great promise for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In this short review, we discuss the data that support why it is important to continue to progress in this class of compounds.\n",
      "To reduce demands on expert time and improve clinical efficiency, we developed a framework to evaluate whether inexpensive, accessible data could accurately classify Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical diagnosis and predict the likelihood of progression.\n",
      "We stratified relevant data into three tiers: obtainable at primary care (low-cost), mostly available at specialty visits (medium-cost), and research-only (high-cost). We trained several machine learning models, including a hierarchical model, an ensemble model, and a clustering model, to distinguish between diagnoses of cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia due to AD.\n",
      "All models showed viable classification, but the hierarchical and ensemble models outperformed the conventional model. Classifier \"error\" was predictive of progression rates, and cluster membership identified subgroups with high and low risk of progression within 1.5 to 3 years.\n",
      "Accessible, inexpensive clinical data can be used to guide AD diagnosis and are predictive of current and future disease states.\n",
      "Classification performance using cost-effective features was accurate and robustHierarchical classification outperformed conventional multinomial classificationClassification labels indicated significant changes in conversion risk at follow-upA clustering-classification method identified subgroups at high risk of decline.\n",
      "BrainAge models based on neuroimaging data have diagnostic classification power but have replicability issues due to site and patient variability. BrainAge models trained on neuropsychological tests could help distinguish stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) from progressive MCI (pMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n",
      "A linear regressor BrainAge model was trained on healthy controls using neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging features separately. The BrainAge delta, predicted age minus chronological age, was used to distinguish between sMCI and pMCI.\n",
      "The cross-validated area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for sMCI versus pMCI was 0.91 for neuropsychological features in contrast to 0.68 for neuroimaging features. The BrainAge delta was correlated with the time to conversion, the time taken for a pMCI subject to convert to AD.\n",
      "The BrainAge delta from neuropsychological tests is a good biomarker to distinguish between sMCI and pMCI. Other neurological and psychiatric disorders could be studied using this strategy.\n",
      "BrainAge models based on neuropsychological tests outperform models based on neuroimaging features when distinguishing between stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) from progressive MCI (pMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).The combination of neuropsychological tests with neuroimaging features does not lead to an improvement in sMCI versus pMCI classification compared to using neuropsychological tests on their own.BrainAge delta of both neuroimaging and neuropsychological models was correlated with the time to conversion, the time taken for a pMCI subject to convert to AD.\n",

      "The TDP43-SAA was optimized using frontal cortex samples from 16 post mortem cases with FTLD-TDP, FTLD with tau inclusions, and controls. Subsequently, olfactory mucosa samples were collected from 17 patients with FTLD-TDP, 15 healthy controls, and three patients carrying MAPT variants.\n",
      "TDP43-SAA discriminated with 100% accuracy post mortem cases presenting or lacking TDP-43 neuropathology. TDP-43 seeding activity was detectable in the olfactory mucosa, and 82.4% of patients with FTLD-TDP tested positive, whereas 86.7% of controls tested negative (P < 0.001). Two out of three patients with MAPT mutations tested negative. In TDP43-SAA positive samples, cytoplasmatic deposits of phosphorylated TDP-43 in the olfactory neural cells were detected.\n",

      "Identifying circulating metabolites associated with dementia, cognition, and brain volume may improve the understanding of dementia pathogenesis and provide novel insights for preventive and therapeutic interventions. This cohort study included a total of 87 885 participants (median follow-up of 9.1 years, 54% female) without dementia at baseline from the UK Biobank. A total of 249 plasma metabolites were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline. Cox proportional regression was used to examine the associations of each metabolite with incident dementia (cases = 1134), Alzheimer's disease (AD; cases = 488), and vascular dementia (VD; cases = 257) during follow-up. Dementia-associated metabolites were further analyzed for association with cognitive deficits (N = 87 885) and brain volume (N = 7756) using logistic regression and linear regression. We identified 26 metabolites associated with incident dementia, of which 6 were associated with incident AD and 5 were associated with incident VD. These 26 dementia-related metabolites were subfractions of intermediate-density lipoprotein, large low-density lipoprotein (L-LDL), small high-density lipoprotein (S-HDL), very-low-density lipoprotein, fatty acids, ketone bodies, citrate, glucose, and valine. Among them, the cholesterol percentage in L-LDL (L-LDL-C%) was associated with lower risk of AD (HR [95% CI] = 0.92 [0.87-0.97], p = 0.002), higher brain cortical (β = 0.047, p = 3.91 × 10\n",
      "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in the regulation of brain health and disease. Microglia perform multiple functions in the central nervous system, including surveillance, phagocytosis and release of a variety of soluble factors. Importantly, a majority of their functions are closely related to changes in their metabolism. This natural inter-dependency between core microglial properties and metabolism offers a unique opportunity to modulate microglial activities via nutritional or metabolic interventions. In this review, we examine the existing scientific literature to synthesize the hypothesis that microglial phagocytosis of amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be selectively enhanced via metabolic interventions. We first review the basics of microglial metabolism and the effects of common metabolites, such as glucose, lipids, ketone bodies, glutamine, pyruvate and lactate, on microglial inflammatory and phagocytic properties. Next, we examine the evidence for dysregulation of microglial metabolism in AD. This is followed by a review of in vivo studies on metabolic manipulation of microglial functions to ascertain their therapeutic potential in AD. Finally, we discuss the effects of metabolic factors on microglial phagocytosis of healthy synapses, a pathological process that also contributes to the progression of AD. We conclude by enlisting the current challenges that need to be addressed before strategies to harness microglial phagocytosis to clear pathological protein deposits in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders can be widely adopted.\n",
      "The function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is impaired in late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), but the associated molecular mechanisms, particularly with respect to the high-risk APOE4/4 genotype, are not well understood. For this purpose, we developed a multicellular isogenic model of the neurovascular unit (NVU) based on human induced pluripotent stem cells.\n",
      "The human NVU was modeled in vitro using isogenic co-cultures of astrocytes, brain capillary endothelial-like cells (BCECs), microglia-like cells, neural stem cells (NSCs), and pericytes. Physiological and pathophysiological properties were investigated as well as the influence of each single cell type on the characteristics and function of BCECs. The barriers established by BCECs were analyzed for specific gene transcription using high-throughput quantitative PCR.\n",
      "Co-cultures were found to tighten the barrier of BCECs and alter its transcriptomic profile under both healthy and disease conditions. In vitro differentiation of brain cell types that constitute the NVU was not affected by the LOAD background. The supportive effect of NSCs on the barrier established by BCECs was diminished under LOAD conditions. Transcriptomes of LOAD BCECs were modulated by different brain cell types. NSCs were found to have the strongest effect on BCEC gene regulation and maintenance of the BBB. Co-cultures showed cell type-specific functional contributions to BBB integrity under healthy and LOAD conditions.\n",
      "Cell type-dependent transcriptional effects on LOAD BCECs were identified. Our study suggests that different brain cell types of the NVU have unique roles in maintaining barrier integrity that vary under healthy and LOAD conditions. .\n",
      "With the increase in the aging population, informal caregivers have become an essential pillar for the long-term care of older individuals. However, providing care can have a negative impact and increase the burden on caregivers, which is a cause for concern.\n",
      "This study aimed to comprehensively depict the concept of \"informal caregiver burden\" through bibliometric and content analyses.\n",
      "We searched the Web of Science (WoS) database to obtain bibliometric data and included only papers published between 2013 and 2022. We used content analysis to extract and identify the core concepts within the text systematically.\n",
      "Altogether, 934 papers were included in the bibliometric analysis, from which we selected 19 highly impactful papers for content analysis. The results indicate that researchers have focused on exploring the factors that impact informal caregiver burden. Meanwhile, there has been a widespread discussion regarding the caregiver burden among those caring for recipients with specific illnesses, such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, as these illnesses can contribute to varying levels of burden on informal caregivers. In addition, questionnaires and interviews emerged as the predominant methods for data collection in the realm of informal caregiver research. Furthermore, we identified 26 distinct assessment tools specifically tailored for evaluating burden, such as caregiver strain index (CSI).\n",
      "For future studies, we suggest considering the intersectionality of factors contributing to the burden on informal caregivers. This approach could enhance the well-being of both caregivers and older care recipients.\n",

      "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs). Although PD is primarily considered a gray matter (GM) disease, alterations in white matter (WM) have gained increasing attention in PD research recently. Here we review evidence collected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques which indicate WM abnormalities in PD, and discuss the correlations between WM changes and specific PD symptoms. Then we summarize transcriptome and genome studies showing the changes of oligodendrocyte (OLs)/myelin in PD. We conclude that WM abnormalities caused by the changes of myelin/OLs might be important for PD pathology, which could be potential targets for PD treatment.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) protein accumulation in the brain. Passive immunotherapies using monoclonal antibodies for targeting Aβ have shown promise for AD treatment. Indeed, recent US FDA approval of aducanumab and lecanemab, alongside positive donanemab Phase III results demonstrated clinical efficacy after decades of failed clinical trials for AD. However, the pharmacological basis distinguishing clinically effective from ineffective therapies remains unclear, impeding development of potent therapeutics. This study aimed to provide a quantitative perspective for effectively targeting Aβ with antibodies. We first reviewed the contradicting results associated with amyloid hypothesis and the pharmacological basis of Aβ immunotherapy. Subsequently, we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model that describes the non-linear progression of Aβ pathology and the pharmacologic actions of the Aβ-targeting antibodies. Using the QSP model, we analyzed various scenarios for effective passive immunotherapy for AD. The model revealed that binding exclusively to the Aβ monomer has minimal effect on Aβ aggregation and plaque reduction, therefore antibody affinity towards Aβ monomer is unwanted, as it could become a distractive mechanism for plaque reduction. Neither early intervention, high brain penetration, nor increased dose alone could yield significant improvement of clinical efficacy for antibodies targeting solely monomers. Antibodies that bind all Aβ species but lack effector function exhibited moderate effects in plaque reduction. Our model highlights the importance of binding aggregate Aβ species and incorporating effector functions for efficient and early plaque reduction, guiding the development of more effective therapies for this devastating disease. \n",

      "The regression model with both vCSF and DTI-ALPS is better associated with brain Aβ deposition. These two independent brain clearance measures may better explain the variation in Aβ deposition than either term individually. Our results suggest that vCSF and DTI-ALPS reflect complementary aspects of brain clearance functions.\n",
      "Cytokines, particularly IL-6, play a crucial role in modulating immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS). Elevated IL-6 levels have been observed in neuroinflammatory conditions, as well as in the sera and brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Multiple Sclerosis, and Alzheimer's. Additionally, alterations in regional brain pH have been noted in these conditions. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), including ASIC1a, activated by low pH levels, are highly abundant in the CNS and have recently been associated with various neurological disorders. Our study examined the impact of IL-6 on ASIC1a channels in cell cultures, demonstrating IL-6-induced the redistribution of cytosolic ASIC1a channels to the cell membrane. This redistribution was accompanied by increased ASIC1a current amplitude upon activation, as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated CaMKII and ERK kinases. Additionally, we observed posttranslational modifications on the ASIC1a channel itself. These findings provide insight into a potential link between inflammatory processes and neurodegenerative mechanisms, highlighting ASIC1a channels as promising therapeutic targets in these conditions.\n",
      "The risk of neurodegeneration was found to be increased among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and others are considered neurodegenerative diseases and can be characterized by progressive loss of neurons. The deficiency of insulin, impaired signaling, and its resistance lead to alteration in the neuronal functioning of the brain. Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a significant role in the amyloid β metabolism, aggregation, and deposition of misfolded proteins in the brain's hippocampal and cortical neuronal regions. The insulin signaling via IP3 activation upregulates the IDE and could be a promising approach to regulate neurodegeneration. The repurposing of existing antidiabetic drugs such as Metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1), sodium-glucose co-transport-2 (SGCT-2) inhibitors, and insulin could be an alternative and effective strategy to treat neurodegeneration via modulating insulin signaling, insulin resistance, IDE activity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, serum lipid profile and neuroinflammation in the brain. Antidiabetic medications reduce the risk of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and Aβ deposition by enhancing their clearance rate. The downregulation of IDE alters the degradation of Aβ monomers in the Tg2576 APP mice. Also, the treatment with metformin activated the AMPK pathway and suppressed mTOR and BACE-1 protein expression in the APP/PS1-induced mice model. Thus, the primary intention of this review is to explore the link between T2DM and neurodegenerative disorders, and the possible role of various antidiabetic drugs in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.\n",

However, the limited toolbox of pharmacological assays hampers the development of advanced ligands. Here, we developed a signaling pathway-independent readout of compound-GPR3 interaction. Starting from computational binding pose predictions of the most potent GPR3 ligand, we designed a series of fluorescent AF64394 analogues and assessed their suitability for BRET-based binding studies.

      "Regulatory T (Treg) cells interact with a variety of resident cells and infiltrated immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) to modulate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition and secondary persistent inflammation due to activation of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrated immune cells contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neurodegeneration. The majority of evidence supports the neuroprotective effects of Treg cells in AD. In the early stages of AD, appropriate Treg cell activity is required for the induction of microglia and astrocyte phagocytic activity in order to clear A deposits and prevent neuroinflammation. Such neuroprotective impacts were in part attributed to the ability of Treg cells to suppress deleterious and/or boost beneficial functions of microglia/astrocytes. In the later stages of AD, an effective Treg cell activity needs to prevent neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Treg cells can exert preventive effects on Th1-, and Th17 cell-related pathologic responses, whilst potentiating Th2-mediated protective activity. The impaired Treg cell-related immunomodulatory mechanisms have been described in AD patients and in related animal models which can contribute to the onset and progression of AD. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive figure regarding the role of Treg cells in AD while highlighting potential therapeutic approaches.\n",
      "Many neurodegenerative diseases involve amyloidogenic proteins forming surface-bound aggregates on anionic membranes, and the peptide amyloid β (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease is one prominent example of this. Curcumin is a small polyphenolic molecule that provides an interesting opportunity to understand the fundamental mechanisms of membrane-mediated aggregation because it embeds into membranes to alter their structure while also altering Aβ aggregation in an aqueous environment. The purpose of this work was to understand interactions among curcumin, β-sheet-rich Aβ fibrillar oligomers (FO), and a model anionic membrane. From a combination of liquid surface X-ray scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we found that curcumin embedded into an anionic 1,2-dimyristoyl-\n",
      "Higher coffee consumption has been associated with reduced dementia risk, yet with inconsistencies across studies. CYP1A2 polymorphisms, which affects caffeine metabolism, may modulate the association between coffee and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We included 5964 participants of the Three-City Study (mean age 74 years-old), free of dementia at baseline when they reported their daily coffee consumption, with available genome-wide genotyping and followed for dementia over a median of 9.0 (range 0.8-18.7) years. In Cox proportional-hazards models, the relationship between coffee consumption and dementia risk was modified by CYP1A2 polymorphism at rs762551 (p for interaction = 0.034). In multivariable-adjusted models, coffee intake was linearly associated with a decreased risk of dementia among carriers of the C allele only (\"slower caffeine metabolizers\"; HR for 1-cup increased [95% CI] 0.90 [0.83-0.97]), while in non-carriers (\"faster caffeine metabolizers\"), there was no significant association but a J-shaped trend toward a decrease in dementia risk up to 3 cups/day and increased risk beyond. Thus, compared to null intake, drinking ≥ 4 cups of coffee daily was associated with a reduced dementia risk in slower but not faster metabolizers (HR [95% CI] for ≥ 4 vs. 0 cup/day = 0.45 [0.25-0.80] and 1.32 [0.89-1.96], respectively). Results were similar when studying AD and another CYP1A2 candidate polymorphism (rs2472304), but no interaction was found with CYP1A2 rs2472297 or rs2470893. In this cohort, a linear association of coffee intake to lower dementia risk was apparent only among carriers of CYP1A2 polymorphisms predisposing to slower caffeine metabolism.\n",
      "Image harmonization has been proposed to minimize heterogeneity in brain PET scans acquired in multi-center studies. However, standard validated methods and software tools are lacking. Here, we assessed the performance of a framework for the harmonization of brain PET scans in a multi-center European clinical trial.\n",
      "Hoffman 3D brain phantoms were acquired in 28 PET systems and reconstructed using site-specific settings. Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the Effective Image Resolution (EIR) and harmonization kernels were estimated for each scan. The target EIR was selected as the coarsest EIR in the imaging network. Using \"Hoffman 3D brain Analysis tool,\" indicators of image quality were calculated before and after the harmonization: The Coefficient of Variance (COV%), Gray Matter Recovery Coefficient (GMRC), Contrast, Cold-Spot RC, and left-to-right GMRC ratio. A COV% ≤ 15% and Contrast ≥ 2.2 were set as acceptance criteria. The procedure was repeated to achieve a 6-mm target EIR in a subset of scans. The method's robustness against typical dose-calibrator-based errors was assessed.\n",
      "The EIR across systems ranged from 3.3 to 8.1 mm, and an EIR of 8 mm was selected as the target resolution. After harmonization, all scans met acceptable image quality criteria, while only 13 (39.4%) did before. The harmonization procedure resulted in lower inter-system variability indicators: Mean ± SD COV% (from 16.97 ± 6.03 to 7.86 ± 1.47%), GMRC Inter-Quartile Range (0.040-0.012), and Contrast SD (0.14-0.05). Similar results were obtained with a 6-mm FWHM target EIR. Errors of ± 10% in the DRO activity resulted in differences below 1 mm in the estimated EIR.\n",
      "Harmonizing the EIR of brain PET scans significantly reduced image quality variability while minimally affecting quantitative accuracy. This method can be used prospectively for harmonizing scans to target sharper resolutions and is robust against dose-calibrator errors. Comparable image quality is attainable in brain PET multi-center studies while maintaining quantitative accuracy.\n",
      "Here, we review recent progress in the diagnosis and management of primary progressive aphasia-the language-led dementias. We pose six key unanswered questions that challenge current assumptions and highlight the unresolved difficulties that surround these diseases. How many syndromes of primary progressive aphasia are there-and is syndromic diagnosis even useful? Are these truly 'language-led' dementias? How can we diagnose (and track) primary progressive aphasia better? Can brain pathology be predicted in these diseases? What is their core pathophysiology? In addition, how can primary progressive aphasia best be treated? We propose that pathophysiological mechanisms linking proteinopathies to phenotypes may help resolve the clinical complexity of primary progressive aphasia, and may suggest novel diagnostic tools and markers and guide the deployment of effective therapies.\n",
      "Sacubitril acts to inhibit neprilysin and as neprilysin is involved in amyloid-beta degradation in the central nervous system, and there is concern that sacubitril/valsartan may increase the risk of dementia.

      "During a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, 526 (2.6%) patients were newly diagnosed with dementia: Alzheimer dementia in 282, vascular dementia in 8, and other dementia in 236. There was no significant difference in the risk of overall dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.01), Alzheimer dementia (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.10), vascular dementia (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.23-4.11), and all other dementias (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62-1.07) between sacubitril/valsartan users and ARB users. These results were consistent regardless of initial sacubitril/valsartan dose and subgroups including old age, previous mild cognitive impairment, previous stroke, and concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation.

      "The aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide and tau protein dysregulation are implicated to play key roles in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and are considered the main pathological hallmarks of this devastating disease. Physiologically, these two proteins are produced and expressed within the normal human body. However, under pathological conditions, abnormal expression, post-translational modifications, conformational changes, and truncation can make these proteins prone to aggregation, triggering specific disease-related cascades. Recent studies have indicated associations between aberrant behavior of amyloid-beta and tau proteins and various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as retinal neurodegenerative diseases like Glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Additionally, these proteins have been linked to cardiovascular disease, cancer, traumatic brain injury, and diabetes, which are all leading causes of morbidity and mortality. In this comprehensive review, we provide an overview of the connections between amyloid-beta and tau proteins and a spectrum of disorders.\n",
      "The study of modified RNA known as epitranscriptomics has become increasingly relevant in our understanding of disease-modifying mechanisms. Methylation of N6 adenosine (m6A) and C5 cytosine (m5C) bases occur on mRNAs, tRNA, mt-tRNA, and rRNA species as well as non-coding RNAs. With emerging knowledge of RNA binding proteins that act as writer, reader, and eraser effector proteins, comes a new understanding of physiological processes controlled by these systems. Such processes when spatiotemporally disrupted within cellular nanodomains in highly specialized tissues such as the brain, give rise to different forms of disease. In this review, we discuss accumulating evidence that changes in the m6A and m5C methylation systems contribute to neurocognitive disorders. Early studies first identified mutations within FMR1 to cause intellectual disability Fragile X syndromes several years before FMR1 was identified as an m6A RNA reader protein. Subsequently, familial mutations within the m6A writer gene METTL5, m5C writer genes NSUN2, NSUN3, NSUN5, and NSUN6, as well as THOC2 and THOC6 that form a protein complex with the m5C reader protein ALYREF, were recognized to cause intellectual development disorders. Similarly, differences in expression of the m5C writer and reader effector proteins, NSUN6, NSUN7, and ALYREF in brain tissue are indicated in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, individuals with a high neuropathological load or have suffered traumatic brain injury. Likewise, an abundance of m6A reader and anti-reader proteins are reported to change across brain regions in Lewy bodies diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with high cognitive reserve. m6A-modified RNAs are also reported significantly more abundant in dementia with Lewy bodies brain tissue but significantly reduced in Parkinson's disease tissue, whilst modified RNAs are misplaced within diseased cells, particularly where synapses are located. In parahippocampal brain tissue, m6A modification is enriched in transcripts associated with psychiatric disorders including conditions with clear cognitive deficits. These findings indicate a diverse set of molecular mechanisms are influenced by RNA methylation systems that can cause neuronal and synaptic dysfunction underlying neurocognitive disorders. Targeting these RNA modification systems brings new prospects for neural regenerative therapies.\n",
      "Cellular senescence and chronic inflammation in response to aging are considered to be indicators of brain aging; they have a great impact on the aging process and are the main risk factors for neurodegeneration. Reviewing the microglial response to aging and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases will help understand the importance of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases. This review describes the origin and function of microglia and focuses on the role of different states of the microglial response to aging and chronic inflammation on the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, and Parkinson's disease. This review also describes the potential benefits of treating neurodegenerative diseases by modulating changes in microglial states. Therefore, inducing a shift from the neurotoxic to neuroprotective microglial state in neurodegenerative diseases induced by aging and chronic inflammation holds promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in the future.\n",
      "Cerebral small vessel disease is a neurological disease that affects the brain microvasculature and which is commonly observed among the elderly. Although at first it was considered innocuous, small vessel disease is nowadays regarded as one of the major vascular causes of dementia. Radiological signs of small vessel disease include small subcortical infarcts, white matter magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensities, lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, cerebral microbleeds, and brain atrophy; however, great heterogeneity in clinical symptoms is observed in small vessel disease patients. The pathophysiology of these lesions has been linked to multiple processes, such as hypoperfusion, defective cerebrovascular reactivity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Notably, studies on small vessel disease suggest that blood-brain barrier dysfunction is among the earliest mechanisms in small vessel disease and might contribute to the development of the hallmarks of small vessel disease. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide a new foundation in the study of small vessel disease pathology. First, we discuss the main structural domains and functions of the blood-brain barrier. Secondly, we review the most recent evidence on blood-brain barrier dysfunction linked to small vessel disease.

Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, especially specific proteolysis, could be a driving force for Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration. Tau physiologically promotes the assembly and stabilization of microtubules, whereas specific truncated fragments are sufficient to induce abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregate into toxic oligomers, resulting in them gaining prion-like characteristics. In addition, Tau truncations cause extensive impairments to neural and glial cell functions and animal cognition and behavior in a fragment-dependent manner. This review summarizes over 60 proteolytic cleavage sites and their corresponding truncated fragments, investigates the role of specific truncations in physiological and pathological states of Alzheimer's disease, and summarizes the latest applications of strategies targeting Tau fragments in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "Recently, with the advent of high-resolution and high-throughput sequencing technologies, an increasing number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to be involved in the regulation of neuronal function in the central nervous system with specific spatiotemporal patterns, across different neurodegenerative diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of lncRNAs during neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the biology of lncRNAs and focuses on introducing the latest identified roles, regulatory mechanisms, and research status of lncRNAs in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Finally, this review discusses the potential values of lncRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases, hoping to provide broader implications for developing effective treatments.\n",
      "Neuroinflammation is widely recognized as a significant hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To combat neuroinflammation, the inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme has been demonstrated crucial. Importantly, sEH inhibition could be related to other neuroprotective pathways described in AD.\n",
      "The aim of the study was to unveil new molecular pathways driving neuroprotection through sEH, we used an optimized, potent, and selective sEH inhibitor (sEHi, UB-SCG-51).\n",
      "UB-SCG-51 was tested in neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, in primary mouse and human astrocytes cultures challenged with proinflammatory insults and in microglia cultures treated with amyloid oligomers, as well as in mice AD model (5XFAD).\n",
      "UB-SCG-51 (10 and 30 μM) prevented neurotoxic reactive-astrocyte conversion in primary mouse astrocytes challenged with TNF-α, IL-1α, and C1q (T/I/C) combination for 24 h. Moreover, in microglial cultures, sEHi reduced inflammation and glial activity. In addition, UB-SCG-51 rescued 5XFAD cognitive impairment, reducing the number of Amyloid-β plaques and Tau hyperphosphorylation accompanied by a reduction in neuroinflammation and apoptotic markers. Notably, a transcriptional profile analysis revealed a new pathway modulated by sEHi treatment. Specifically, the eIF2α/CHOP pathway, which promoted the endoplasmic reticulum response, was increased in the 5XFAD-treated group. These findings were confirmed in human primary astrocytes by combining sEHi and eIF2α inhibitor (eIF2αi) treatment. Besides, combining both treatments resulted in increased in C3 gene expression after T/I/C compared with the group treated with sEHi alone in cultures.\n",
      "Therefore, sEHi rescued cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in AD mice model, based on the reduction of inflammation and eIF2α/CHOP signaling pathway.\n",
      "In whole, our results support the concept that targeting neuroinflammation through sEH inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy to fight against Alzheimer's disease with additive and/or synergistic activities targeting neuroinflammation and cell stress.\n",
      "Mothers transmit Alzheimer's disease (AD) more frequently than fathers. Factors other than female longevity may be at work to promote maternal transmission of AD. Among these are the X chromosome, mitochondrial DNA, and AD comorbidities, especially depression. A recent study associated mitochondrial SNP rs2853499 with AD.\n",
      "We used UK Biobank (UKBB) data to investigate the relation of mitochondrial SNP rs2853499, with AD. To identify cases of AD we used ICD10 code G30.9. Data processing was performed on Minerva, a Linux mainframe with Centos 7.6, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We used PLINK, a whole-genome association analysis toolset, to analyze the UKB22418 mitochondrial hard-called chromosome file.\n",
      "Of 953 AD cases, 493 were male (51.7%) and 460 were female (48.3%). Mothers were twice as likely to transmit AD compared to fathers. We found that in individuals with AD, 22.3% (n=201) carried the A allele of SNP rs2853499, 77.7% (n=700) carried the G allele. In individuals without AD, 22.2% (n=10,7726) carried the A allele of SNP rs2853499, 77.8% (n=378,535) carried the G allele. This difference was not significant (p=0.91, two-tailed Fisher exact test). Therefore, factors other than mitochondrial SNP rs2853499 may be at work to promote maternal transmission of AD.\n",
      "We conclude that depression, a multigenic illness, in the mother is most likely the basis for the fact that mothers transmit AD twice as often as fathers.\n",
      "Many studies indicate that smaller life space is related to worse cognitive and motor function. It is plausible that cognitive and motor function also predict life space constriction, thus long-term, prospective studies are needed of cognitive and motor function as predictors of life space.\n",
      "A total of 1246 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project, who reported initial maximal life space and at least one follow-up assessment were included in this prospective study, with up to 19 years follow-up. The outcome of interest was the Modified version of the Life Space Questionnaire; which we categorized into large (beyond community), medium (neighborhood/community), and small (home/yard) life space. Participants also had detailed composite measures of global cognition and motor function as predictors and available at the first life space assessment. Life space transitions over one-year periods were modeled using multistate Markov modeling, including confounders and both predictors simultaneously.\n",
      "Better cognitive and motor function were broadly associated with lower odds of life space constriction (Cognitive: Large ➔ medium: OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00; Large ➔ small: OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97; Medium ➔ small: OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.82-1.22.

      "Combined with previous literature that life space predicts function, these results support the notion of complex inter-relations of cognitive function, motor function, and life space.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a biologically heterogenous disease. In a previous study, we classified 245 patients with probable AD into the typical AD (TAD), limbic-predominant (LP), hippocampal-sparing (HS) and minimal-change (MC) subtypes based on their medial temporal lobe atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging and posterior hypoperfusion on single-photon emission computed tomography, and described differences in clinical features among the patients with different AD subtypes. This study aimed to clarify the longitudinal patterns of changes in patients with the various AD subtypes by follow-up brain imaging analyses.\n",
      "Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging or single-photon emission computed tomography data obtained 12-48 months after the first brain imaging were investigated in 79 patients with probable AD, comprising 25 of the TAD subtype, 19 of the LP subtype, 17 of the HS subtype and 18 of the MC subtype.\n",
      "All patients of the TAD subtype remained as the same subtype at follow up. Approximately 37% of patients of the LP subtype and 29% of patients of the HS subtype progressed to the TAD subtype, and 17%, 33% and 6% of the MC subtype progressed to the TAD, LP and HS subtypes, respectively. The group of patients showing subtype progression was associated only with a longer follow-up duration.\n",
      "There might be different progression patterns and progression rates of changes among the atypical AD subtypes. Further longitudinal brain imaging studies might provide information regarding the pathophysiological association between the various AD subtypes, and might be helpful for determining appropriate therapies and management methods.

      "Age-related alterations in physiology lead to declines in physical function that are associated with numerous adverse outcomes among older adults. Utilizing a hybrid design, we aimed to understand whether both long-term and short-term Tai Chi (TC) training are associated with age-related decline in physical function in healthy older adults. We first conducted cross-sectional comparisons among TC-naïve older adults (n = 60, 64.2 ± 7.7 years), TC-expert older adults (n = 27, 62.8 ± 7.6 years, 24.5 ± 12 years experience), and TC-naïve younger adults (n = 15, 28.7 ± 3.2 years) to inform long-term effects of TC training on physical function, including single leg stance time with eyes closed, grip strength, Timed Up and Go, maximum walking speed, functional reach, and vertical jump for lower-extremity power. There were significant differences among the three groups on all the six tests. For most functional tests, TC-experts performed better than age-matched TC-naïve controls and were statistically indistinguishable from young healthy adult controls. Long-term TC training was associated with higher levels of physical function in older adults, suggesting a potential preventative healthy aging effect. In the randomized longitudinal trial, TC-naïve subjects were randomized (n = 31 to Tai Chi group, n = 29 to usual care control group) to evaluate the short-term effects of TC over 6 months on all outcomes. TC's short-term impacts on physical function were small and not statistically significant. The impact of short-term training in healthy adults is less clear. Both potential longer-term preventive effects and shorter-term restorative effects warrant further research with rigorous, adequately powered controlled clinical trials.\n",
      "Microglia are closely linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) many years ago; however, the pathological mechanisms of AD remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether leptin affected microglia in the hippocampus of young and aged male APP/PS1 mice.\n",
      "In a transgenic model of AD, we investigated the association between intraperitoneal injection of leptin and microglia.\n",
      "We intraperitoneal injection of leptin (1mg/kg) every day for one week and analyzed inflammatory markers in microglia in the hippocampus of adult (6 months) and aged (12 months) APP/PS1 mice.\n",
      "In all leptin treatment group, the brain Aβ levels were decrease. We found increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and microglial activation in the hippocampus of adult mice. Using aged mice as an experimental model for chronic neuroinflammation and leptin resistance, the number of Iba-1+ microglia and the levels of IL-1β/IL-6 in the hippocampus were greatly increased as compared to the adult. But between the leptin treatment and un-treatment, there were no difference.\n",
      "Leptin signaling would regulate the activation of microglia and the release of inflammatory factors, but it is not the only underlying mechanism in the neuroprotective effects of AD pathogenesis.\n",
      "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is recognized as a preclinical indicator of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this stage provides a valuable time window for ultra-early intervention in AD. The aim of this study was to investigate the neurocognitive characteristics of SCD and its correlation with objective cognition, negative emotion and sleep quality in Chinese elderly.\n",

      "Diffusion tensor imaging has been used to assess white matter (WM) changes in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the tensor model is necessarily limited by its assumptions. Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) can offer insights into microstructural features of WM change. We assessed whether NODDI more sensitively detects AD-related changes in medial temporal lobe WM than traditional tensor metrics.\n",
      "Standard diffusion and NODDI metrics were calculated for medial temporal WM tracts from 199 older adults drawn from ADNI3 who also received PET to measure pathology and neuropsychological testing.\n",
      "NODDI measures in medial temporal tracts were more strongly correlated to cognitive performance and pathology than standard measures. The combination of NODDI and standard metrics exhibited the strongest prediction of cognitive performance in random forest analyses.\n",
      "NODDI metrics offer additional insights into contributions of WM degeneration to cognitive outcomes in the aging brain.\n",
      "Neuroinflammation, impaired metabolism, and hypoperfusion are fundamental pathological hallmarks of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous studies have asserted a close association between neuroinflammation and disrupted cerebral energetics. During AD progression and other neurodegenerative disorders, a persistent state of chronic neuroinflammation reportedly exacerbates cytotoxicity and potentiates neuronal death. Here, we assessed the impact of a neuroinflammatory challenge on metabolic demand and microvascular hemodynamics in the somatosensory cortex of an AD mouse model. We utilized in vivo 2-photon microscopy and the phosphorescent oxygen sensor Oxyphor 2P to measure partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and capillary red blood cell flux in cortical microvessels of awake mice. Intravascular pO2 and capillary RBC flux measurements were performed in 8-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and wildtype littermates on days 0, 7, and 14 of a 14-day period of lipopolysaccaride-induced neuroinflammation. Before the induced inflammatory challenge, AD mice demonstrated reduced metabolic demand but similar capillary red blood cell flux as their wild type counterparts. Neuroinflammation provoked significant reductions in cerebral intravascular oxygen levels and elevated oxygen extraction in both animal groups, without significantly altering red blood cell flux in capillaries. This study provides evidence that neuroinflammation alters cerebral oxygen demand at the early stages of AD without substantially altering vascular oxygen supply. The results will guide our understanding of neuroinflammation's influence on neuroimaging biomarkers for early AD diagnosis.\n",
      "The PINK1-PRKN pathway mediates a critical quality control to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for \n",
      "The development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex process that can change over time, during which genetic influences on phenotypes may also fluctuate. Incorporating longitudinal phenotypes in genome wide association studies (GWAS) could help unmask genetic loci with time-varying effects. In this study, we incorporated a varying coefficient test in a longitudinal GWAS model to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may have time- or age-dependent effects in AD.\n",
      "Genotype data from 1,877 participants in the Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Data Initiative (ADNI) were imputed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel, resulting in 9,573,130 SNPs. Subjects' longitudinal impairment status at each visit was considered as a binary and clinical phenotype. Participants' composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) derived from each longitudinal amyloid PET scan was considered as a continuous and biological phenotype. The retrospective varying coefficient mixed model association test (RVMMAT) was used in longitudinal GWAS to detect time-varying genetic effects on the impairment status and SUVR measures. Post-hoc analyses were performed on genome-wide significant SNPs, including 1) pathway analyses; 2) age-stratified genotypic comparisons and regression analyses; and 3) replication analyses using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC).\n",
      "Our model identified 244 genome-wide significant SNPs that revealed time-varying genetic effects on the clinical impairment status in AD; among which, 12 SNPs on chromosome 19 were successfully replicated using data from NACC. Post-hoc age-stratified analyses indicated that for most of these 244 SNPs, the maximum genotypic effect on impairment status occurred between 70 to 80 years old, and then declined with age. Our model further identified 73 genome-wide significant SNPs associated with the temporal variation of amyloid accumulation. For these SNPs, an increasing genotypic effect on PET-SUVR was observed as participants' age increased. Functional pathway analyses on significant SNPs for both phenotypes highlighted the involvement and disruption of immune responses- and neuroinflammation-related pathways in AD.\n",
      "We demonstrate that longitudinal GWAS models with time-varying coefficients can boost the statistical power in AD-GWAS. In addition, our analyses uncovered potential time-varying genetic variants on repeated measurements of clinical and biological phenotypes in AD.\n",
      "Almost every recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) genome-wide association study (GWAS) has performed meta-analysis to combine studies with clinical diagnosis of AD with studies that use proxy phenotypes based on parental disease history. Here, we report major limitations in current GWAS-by-proxy (GWAX) practices due to uncorrected survival bias and non-random participation of parental illness survey, which cause substantial discrepancies between AD GWAS and GWAX results. We demonstrate that current AD GWAX provide highly misleading genetic correlations between AD risk and higher education which subsequently affects a variety of genetic epidemiologic applications involving AD and cognition. Our study sheds important light on the design and analysis of mid-aged biobank cohorts and underscores the need for caution when interpreting genetic association results based on proxy-reported parental disease history.\n",

      "Peptides and proteins containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are a large and important class of biopolymers. They include non-ribosomally synthesised peptides, post-translationally modified proteins, expressed or synthesised proteins containing unnatural amino acids, and peptides and proteins that are chemically modified. Here, we describe a general procedure for generating atomic descriptions required to incorporate ncAAs within popular NMR structure determination software such as CYANA, CNS, Xplor-NIH and ARIA. This procedure is made publicly available via the existing Automated Topology Builder (ATB) server (https://atb.uq.edu.au, last access: 17 February 2023) with all submitted ncAAs stored in a dedicated database. The described procedure also includes a general method for linking of side chains of amino acids from CYANA templates. To ensure compatibility with other systems, atom names comply with IUPAC guidelines. In addition to describing the workflow, 3D models of complex natural products generated by CYANA are presented, including vancomycin. In order to demonstrate the manner in which the templates for ncAAs generated by the ATB can be used in practice, we use a combination of CYANA and CNS to solve the structure of a synthetic peptide designed to disrupt Alzheimer-related protein-protein interactions. Automating the generation of structural templates for ncAAs will extend the utility of NMR spectroscopy to studies of more complex biomolecules, with applications in the rapidly growing fields of synthetic biology and chemical biology. The procedures we outline can also be used to standardise the creation of structural templates for any amino acid and thus have the potential to impact structural biology more generally.\n",

Gem is used to lower the levels of triglycerides and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in patients. Experimental studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that Gem can prevent or slow the progression of neurological disorders (NDs), including cerebral ischemia (CI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Neuroinflammation is known to play a significant role in these disorders.\n",

Disulfidptosis is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death that holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for various disorders. However, the functional roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in AD remain unknown.\n",
      "Microarray data and clinical information from patients with AD and healthy controls were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. A thorough examination of DRG expression and immune characteristics in both groups was performed. Based on the identified DRGs, we performed an unsupervised clustering analysis to categorize the AD samples into various disulfidptosis-related molecular clusters. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to select hub genes specific to disulfidptosis-related AD clusters. The performances of various machine learning models were compared to determine the optimal predictive model. The predictive ability of the optimal model was assessed using nomogram analysis and five external datasets.\n",
      "Eight DRGs showed differential expression between the AD and control samples. Two different molecular clusters were identified. The immune cell infiltration analysis revealed distinct differences in the immune microenvironment of the two clusters. The support vector machine model showed the highest performance, and a panel of five signature genes was identified, which showed excellent performance on the external validation datasets. The nomogram analysis also showed high accuracy in predicting AD.\n",

Amyloid beta (Aβ)- accumulating macromolecules in the brain are the primary cause of the disease's chronic symptoms, according to analysis carried out during the last 20 years. Plaques and clumps of amyloid- build up in the brain, obstructing neuronal signals and destroying neural connections. Tau, a protein that results in the formation of \"neurofibrillary tangles\" in the brain, another hallmark of neuronal death, has been the focus of a lot of research. Dendrimers Delivery (DDs) is one of the most promising advancements in nanotechnology for biomedical applications, particularly drug delivery. Some of the main categories of dendrimers employed in the successful management of neurodegenerative illnesses are polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM) dendrimers, polypropylenimine dendrimers (PPI), Poly-l-lysine dendrimers (PLL), and carbosilane dendrimers. The tight blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the entry of medications or therapeutic agents, makes it difficult to treat central nervous system disorders. Dendrimers have attracted the attention of scientists more than other non-invasive methods of drug delivery across the BBB and improve the uptake of medicines in the brain's target tissues. The major benefits of dendrimers include their adaptability, biocompatibility, ability to load pharmaceuticals into the core and surface, and nanosize.

The traditional Chinese medicine, Corididius chinensis (Cc) has been proven to have a certain curative effect on Mn poisoning. Therefore, network pharmacology was performed to explore potential therapeutic targets and pharmacological mechanisms of Cc. We found ingredients by building our own database through literature, (which is the first to screen traditional Chinese medicine without traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform databases and it is applicable whenever a Chinese medicine is not found in the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform database) and potential targets of Mn-induced nervous system diseases from the OMIM, GeneCards, and DrugBank database were identified. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape. Gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment analysis was performed for the treatment of Mn-induced nervous system disease, and molecular docking was carried out to verify the results of network pharmacology analysis. After screening disease-related genes, 12 intersecting genes overlapped between 284 target proteins of the active compound and 195 potential disease targets. The pathways of neurodegeneration_multiple diseases and Alzheimer disease pathway may be the most potential pathway of Cc treating Mn-induced nervous system diseases.

This review critically examines the current evidence regarding the intricate relationship between diabetes and cognitive decline. It highlights the existing knowledge on the impact of diabetes on cognitive function, spanning from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, including vascular and Alzheimer dementia. The review underscores the need for a standardized diagnostic paradigm and explores research gaps, such as the implications of cognitive impairment in younger populations and various diabetes types. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the relevance of diabetes-related comorbidities, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, in influencing cognitive decline. It advocates for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from neuroscience, endocrinology, and immunology to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of diabetes-related cognitive impairment. The second part of this review outlines prospective research directions and opportunities. It advocates for longitudinal studies to understand disease progression better and identifies critical windows of vulnerability.

      "To investigate the effect of survivin on neurogenesis in neural stem cells (NSCs), we treated mouse embryonic NSCs with a survivin inhibitor (YM155) and adeno-associated viral survivin (AAV-Survivin). To explore the potential role of survivin expression in AD, AAV9-Survivin or AAV9-GFP were injected into the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus of 7-month-old wild-type and 5XFAD mice. Cognitive function was measured by the Y maze and Morris water maze. Neurogenesis was investigated by BrdU staining, immature, and mature neuron markers.\n",
      "Our results indicate that suppression of survivin expression resulted in decreased neurogenesis. Conversely, overexpression of survivin using AAV-Survivin restored neurogenesis in NSCs that had been suppressed by YM155 treatment. Furthermore, the expression level of survivin decreased in the 9-month-old 5XFAD compared with that in wild-type mice. AAV-Survivin-mediated overexpression of survivin in the DG in 5XFAD mice enhanced neurogenesis and cognitive function.\n",

      "Light triggers numerous non-image-forming, or non-visual, biological effects. The brain correlates of these non-image-forming effects have been investigated, notably using magnetic resonance imaging and short light exposures varying in irradiance and spectral quality. However, it is not clear whether non-image-forming responses estimation may be biased by having light in sequential blocks, for example, through a potential carryover effect of one light onto the next. We reasoned that pupil light reflex was an easy readout of one of the non-image-forming effects of light that could be used to address this issue. We characterised the sustained pupil light reflex in 13-16 healthy young individuals under short light exposures during three distinct cognitive processes (executive, emotional and attentional). Light conditions pseudo-randomly alternated between monochromatic orange light (0.16 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux) and polychromatic blue-enriched white light of three different levels (37, 92, 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux). As expected, higher melanopic irradiance was associated with larger sustained pupil light reflex in each cognitive domain. This result was stable over the light sequence under higher melanopic irradiance levels compared with lower ones. Exploratory frequency-domain analyses further revealed that sustained pupil light reflex was more variable under lower melanopic irradiance levels. Importantly, sustained pupil light reflex varied across tasks independently of the light condition, pointing to a potential impact of light history and/or cognitive context on sustained pupil light reflex. Together, our results emphasise that the distinct contribution and adaptation of the different retinal photoreceptors influence the non-image-forming effects of light and therefore potentially their brain correlates.\n",
      "The results of the CLARITY-AD, GRADUATE I and II, and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trials have rekindled discussion on the impact of amyloid-targeting drugs. We use a Bayesian approach to quantify how rational observers would have updated their prior beliefs based on new trial results.\n",
      "We used publicly available data from the CLARITY-AD, GRADUATE I and II, and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trials to estimate the effect of reducing amyloid on the clinical dementia rating scale, sum of boxes (CDR-SB) score. A range of prior positions were then updated according to Bayes' theorem using these estimates.\n",
      "After updating with new trial data, a wide range of starting positions resulted in credible intervals that did not include no effect of amyloid reduction on CDR-SB score.\n",
      "For a range of starting beliefs and assuming the veracity of the underlying data, rational observers would conclude there is a small benefit of amyloid reductions on cognition. This benefit must be weighed against opportunity cost and side-effect risk.\n",
      "The results of recent trials of amyloid-targeting drugs have rekindled discussion on the impact of amyloid reductions achieved with amyloid-targeting drugs on cognition. Prior to the announcement of trial results, beliefs about the effects of altering amyloid levels varied. For a range of starting beliefs, one would conclude there is a small benefit of amyloid reductions due to amyloid-targeting drugs on cognition. The perceived value of individual drugs must balance the magnitude of this benefit against opportunity cost and risk of side effects.\n",

      "The high mutation rate throughout the entire melanoma genome presents a major challenge in stratifying true driver events from the background mutations. Numerous recurrent non-coding alterations, such as those in enhancers, can shape tumor evolution, thereby emphasizing the importance in systematically deciphering enhancer disruptions in melanoma.\n",
      "Here, we leveraged 297 melanoma whole-genome sequencing samples to prioritize highly recurrent regions. By performing a genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen on highly recurrent region-associated enhancers in melanoma cells, we identified 66 significant hits which could have tumor-suppressive roles. These functional enhancers show unique mutational patterns independent of classical significantly mutated genes in melanoma. Target gene analysis for the essential enhancers reveal many known and hidden mechanisms underlying melanoma growth. Utilizing extensive functional validation experiments, we demonstrate that a super enhancer element could modulate melanoma cell proliferation by targeting MEF2A, and another distal enhancer is able to sustain PTEN tumor-suppressive potential via long-range interactions.\n",

      "Pathological tau accumulates in the brain in tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration, and forms amyloid-like filaments incorporating various post-translational modifications (PTMs). Cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) studies have demonstrated that tau filaments extracted from tauopathy brains are characteristic of the disease and share a common fold(s) in the same disease group. Furthermore, the tau PTM profile changes during tau pathology formation and disease progression, and disease-specific PTMs are detected in and around the filament core. In addition, templated seeding has been suggested to trigger pathological tau amplification and spreading in vitro and in vivo, although the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Recently, we reported that the cryo-EM structures of tau protofilaments in SH-SY5Y cells seeded with patient-derived tau filaments show a core structure(s) resembling that of the original seeds. Here, we investigated PTMs of tau filaments accumulated in the seeded cells by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and compared them with the PTMs of patient-derived tau filaments. Examination of insoluble tau extracted from SH-SY5Y cells showed that numerous phosphorylation, deamidation and oxidation sites detected in the fuzzy coat in the original seeds were well reproduced in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, templated tau filament formation preceded both truncation of the N-/C-terminals of tau and PTMs in and around the filament core, indicating these PTMs may predominantly be introduced after the degradation of the fuzzy coat.\n",
      "Genotypes are strongly associated with disease phenotypes, particularly in brain disorders. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind this association remain elusive. With emerging multimodal data for these mechanisms, machine learning methods can be applied for phenotype prediction at different scales, but due to the black-box nature of machine learning, integrating these modalities and interpreting biological mechanisms can be challenging. Additionally, the partial availability of these multimodal data presents a challenge in developing these predictive models.\n",
      "To address these challenges, we developed DeepGAMI, an interpretable neural network model to improve genotype-phenotype prediction from multimodal data. DeepGAMI leverages functional genomic information, such as eQTLs and gene regulation, to guide neural network connections. Additionally, it includes an auxiliary learning layer for cross-modal imputation allowing the imputation of latent features of missing modalities and thus predicting phenotypes from a single modality. Finally, DeepGAMI uses integrated gradient to prioritize multimodal features for various phenotypes.\n",
      "We applied DeepGAMI to several multimodal datasets including genotype and bulk and cell-type gene expression data in brain diseases, and gene expression and electrophysiology data of mouse neuronal cells. Using cross-validation and independent validation, DeepGAMI outperformed existing methods for classifying disease types, and cellular and clinical phenotypes, even using single modalities (e.g., AUC score of 0.79 for Schizophrenia and 0.73 for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease).\n",
      "We demonstrated that DeepGAMI improves phenotype prediction and prioritizes phenotypic features and networks in multiple multimodal datasets in complex brains and brain diseases. Also, it prioritized disease-associated variants, genes, and regulatory networks linked to different phenotypes, providing novel insights into the interpretation of gene regulatory mechanisms. DeepGAMI is open-source and available for general use.\n",
      "Pets play very important roles for older adults. However, whether the same roles apply to pets of care clients receiving long-term care at home (LTCH) is unclear. This study aimed primarily to explore whether the roles of pets for LTCH-clients who own pets are comparable to the roles of pets for older adults in the general population. Furthermore, we explored potential pet-related problems that might be encountered in LTCH in practice, and the potential influences of pet ownership on caregiving relationships. These insights may help improve long-term care services in LTCH.\n",
      "This project started with a study using the Consensual Qualitative Research method (CQR). We conducted semi-structured interviews based on themes from our previous review (e.g., Relational Aspects, Emotional Aspects, and Social Aspects). Secondly, an online survey was used to confirm the findings from the CQR study by calculating Content Validity Index scores (in SPSS 26) regarding contents, relevance, and clarity. The survey also included open-ended questions on potential pet-related problems and their impact on caregiving relationships for LTCH-clients, family caregivers, and professional caregivers.\n",
      "The CQR study found that the roles pets play for LTCH-clients (N = 8), family caregivers (N = 10), and professional caregivers (N = 10) were similar to the roles pets play for older adults in the general population. The online survey confirmed most of the CQR findings. In the survey, LTCH-clients (N = 4), family caregivers (N = 8), professional caregivers (N = 8), and researchers in human-animal studies and in geriatric care (N = 5) reported various potential problems that could arise from pet ownership by LTCH-clients, such as clients with deteriorating health being forced to part with their pets. Participants also reported potential positive and negative effects of pet ownership on caregiving relationships, such as pets being a nice topic of conversation, or, conversely, a source of disagreement in the LTCH context.\n",
      "The roles pets play for LTCH-clients seem comparable to the roles pets play for older adults in the general population. In addition, LTCH-clients might experience pet-related problems specific to the LTCH context. Pets may influence caregiving relationships, either positively or negatively. Therefore, instruments and guidelines are needed to account for pets in LTCH.\n",
      "Early prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a feasible way to delay AD onset and progression. Information on AD prediction at the individual patient level will be useful in AD prevention. In this study, we aim to develop risk models for predicting AD onset at individual level using optimal set of predictors from multiple features.\n",
      "A total of 487 cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 796 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients were included from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. All the participants were assessed for clinical, cognitive, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers and followed for mean periods of 5.6 years for CN individuals and 4.6 years for MCI patients to ascertain progression from CN to incident prodromal stage of AD or from MCI to AD dementia. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Cox regression was applied for predictors selection and model construction.\n",
      "During the follow-up periods, 139 CN participants had progressed to prodromal AD (CDR ≥ 0.5) and 321 MCI patients had progressed to AD dementia. In the prediction of individual risk of incident prodromal stage of AD in CN individuals, the AUC of the final CN model was 0.81 within 5 years. The final MCI model predicted individual risk of AD dementia in MCI patients with an AUC of 0.92 within 5 years. The models were also associated with longitudinal change of Mini-Mental State Examination (p < 0.001 for CN and MCI models). An Alzheimer's continuum model was developed which could predict the Alzheimer's continuum for individuals with normal AD biomarkers within 3 years with high accuracy (AUC = 0.91).\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of senile plaques composed of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) aggregates with toxic effects that are still not fully understood. Recently, it was discovered that Aβ(1-42) fibrils possess catalytic activity on acetylcholine hydrolysis. Catalytic amyloids are an emerging and exciting field of research. In this study, we examined the catalytic activity of the fibrils formed by Aβ(1-40), the most abundant Aβ variant, on acetylcholine hydrolysis. Our findings reveal that Aβ(1-40) fibrils exhibit moderate enzymatic activity, indicating that natural peptide aggregates could serve as biocatalysts and provide new insights into the potential role of Aβ in neurological disorders.\n",
      "Prior evidence suggests that Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals differ in potential risk factors for the development of dementia. Here we determine whether specific brain regions are associated with cognitive performance for either ethnicity along various stages of Alzheimer's disease. For this cross-sectional study, we examined 108 participants (61 Hispanic vs. 47 Non-Hispanic individuals) from the 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (1Florida ADRC), who were evaluated at baseline with diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid imaging. We used FreeSurfer to segment 34 cortical regions of interest. Baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used as measures of cognitive performance. Group analyses assessed free-water measures (FW) and volume. Statistically significant FW regions based on ethnicity x group interactions were used in a stepwise regression function to predict total MMSE and MoCA scores. Random forest models were used to identify the most predictive brain-based measures of a dementia diagnosis separately for Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups. Results indicated elevated FW values for the left inferior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left banks of the superior temporal sulcus, left supramarginal gyrus, right amygdala, and right entorhinal cortex in Hispanic AD subjects compared to non-Hispanic AD subjects. These alterations occurred in the absence of different volumes of these regions in the two AD groups. FW may be useful in detecting individual differences potentially reflective of varying etiology that can influence cognitive decline and identify MRI predictors of cognitive performance, particularly among Hispanics.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, causes short-term memory and cognition declines. It is estimated that one in three elderly people die from AD or other dementias. Chinese herbal medicine as a potential drug for treating AD has gained growing interest from many researchers. Moschus, a rare and valuable traditional Chinese animal medicine, was originally documented in Shennong Ben Cao Jing and recognized for its properties of reviving consciousness/resuscitation. Additionally, Moschus has the efficacy of \"regulation of menstruation with blood activation, relief of swelling and pain\" and is used for treating unconsciousness, stroke, coma, and cerebrovascular diseases. However, it is uncertain whether Moschus has any protective effect on AD patients. We explored whether Moschus could protect glutamate (Glu)-induced PC12 cells from cellular injury and preliminarily explored their related action mechanisms. The chemical compounds of Moschus were analyzed and identified by GC-MS. The Glu-induced differentiated PC12 cell model was thought to be the common AD cellular model. The study aims to preliminarily investigate the intervention effect of Moschus on Glu-induced PC12 cell damage as well as their related action mechanisms. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cell apoptosis, autophagic vacuoles, autolysosomes or autophagosomes, proteins related to apoptosis, and the proteins related to autophagy were examined and analyzed. Seventeen active compounds of the Moschus sample were identified based on GC-MS analysis. In comparison to the control group, Glu stimulation increased cell viability loss, LDH release, mitochondrial damage, loss of MMP, apoptosis rate, and the number of cells containing autophagic vacuoles, and autolysosomes or autophagosomes, while these results were decreased after the pretreatment with Moschus and 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Furthermore, Glu stimulation significantly increased cleaved caspase-3, Beclin1, and LC3II protein expression, and reduced B-cell lymphoma 2/BAX ratio and p62 protein expression, but these results were reversed after pretreatment of Moschus and 3-MA. Moschus has protective activity in Glu-induced PC12 cell injury, and the potential mechanism might involve the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. Our study may promote research on Moschus in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, and Moschus may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a physical illness, which damages a person's brain; it is the most common cause of dementia. AD can be characterized by the formation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposits. They exhibit diverse morphologies that range from diffuse to dense-core plaques. Most of the histological images cannot be described precisely by traditional geometry or methods. Therefore, this study aims to employ multifractal geometry in assessing and classifying amyloid plaque morphologies. The classification process is based on extracting the most descriptive features related to the amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposits using the Naive Bayes classifier. To eliminate the less important features, the Random Forest algorithm has been used. The proposed methodology has achieved an accuracy of 99%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 98.5%. This study employed a new dataset that had not been widely used before.\n",
      "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic illness wherein relapses contribute to significant patient morbidity and mortality. Near-term prediction of relapses in MDD patients has the potential to improve outcomes by helping implement a 'predict and preempt' paradigm in clinical care. In this study, we developed a novel personalized (N-of-1) encoder-decoder anomaly detection-based framework of combining anomalies in multivariate actigraphy features (passive) as triggers to utilize an active concurrent self-reported symptomatology questionnaire (core symptoms of depression and anxiety) to predict near-term relapse in MDD. The framework was evaluated on two independent longitudinal observational trials, characterized by regular bimonthly (every other month) in-person clinical assessments, weekly self-reported symptom assessments, and continuous activity monitoring data with two different wearable sensors for ≥ 1 year or until the first relapse episode. This combined passive-active relapse prediction framework achieved a balanced accuracy of ≥ 71%, false alarm rate of ≤ 2.3 alarm/patient/year with a median relapse detection time of 2-3 weeks in advance of clinical onset in both studies. The study results suggest that the proposed personalized N-of-1 prediction framework is generalizable and can help predict a majority of MDD relapses in an actionable time frame with relatively low patient and provider burden.\n",

      "Apathy is a pervasive clinical syndrome in neurocognitive disorders, characterized by a quantitative reduction in goal-directed behaviors. The brain structures involved in the physiopathology of apathy have also been connected to the brain structures involved in probabilistic reward learning in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This dilemma in question involves the challenge of selecting between a familiar option with a more predictable outcome, and another option whose outcome is uncertain and may yield potentially greater rewards compared to the known option. The aim of this study was to combine experimental procedures and computational modeling to examine whether, in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorders, apathy affects performance in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Through using a four-armed bandit reinforcement-learning task, we showed that apathetic older adults explored more and performed worse than non-apathetic subjects. Moreover, the mental flexibility assessed by the Trail-making test-B was negatively associated with the percentage of exploration. These results suggest that apathy is characterized by an increased explorative behavior and inefficient decision-making, possibly due to weak mental flexibility to switch toward the exploitation of the more rewarding options. Apathetic participants also took longer to make a choice and failed more often to respond in the allotted time, which could reflect the difficulties in action initiation and selection. In conclusion, the present results suggest that apathy in participants with neurocognitive disorders is associated with specific disturbances in the exploration-exploitation trade-off and sheds light on the disturbances in reward processing in patients with apathy.\n",
      "Plaque formation, microglial activation, and synaptic loss are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, however, removing plaques have had little clinical benefit. Here, we show that neuregulin-1, a glial growth factor, induces inflammatory cytokines and promotes phagocytic activity in vitro and augments microglial activation and plaque formation in 5XFAD Alzheimer's mice. Brain-specific targeting of neuregulin-1 by intraventricular delivery of a novel neuregulin-1 fusion protein antagonist GlyB4 significantly alters microglial morphology and function to a non-pathogenic morphology in early-stage 5XFAD mice and prevents plaques from forming. Once plaques have already formed, GlyB4 reduces new plaque formation and prevents synaptic loss. Selective, targeted disruption of neuregulin-1 signaling on brain microglia with GlyB4 could be a novel 'upstream' approach to slow or stop disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.\n",

Eligible participants are randomly allocated to one of two intervention arms for 12 weeks: (1) the MyCOACH intervention programme or (2) email bulletins with general healthy ageing information (active control). The MyCOACH intervention programme provides participants with information about memory impairments and dementia, memory strategies and different lifestyle factors associated with brain ageing as well as practical support including goal setting, motivational interviewing, brain training, dietary and exercise consultations, and a 26-week post-intervention booster session. Follow-up assessments are conducted for all participants at 13, 39 and 65 weeks from baseline, with the primary outcome being exposure to dementia risk factors measured using the Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index.

In front of this important achievement, so far, (i) CSF AD biomarkers have not yet been adopted for routine clinical use in all Centers dedicated to AD, mainly due to inter-lab variation and lack of internationally accepted cutoff values; (ii) we do need to add other biomarkers more suitable to correlate with the clinical stage and disease monitoring; (iii) we also need to detect the co-presence of other 'non-AD' pathologies.\n",

The magnitude of the group difference depended on region, with largest group differences in TSPO in cingulate and frontal cortices as well as hippocampus. Compared with noncollision sport athletes, former NFL players performed worse in learning (mean difference [MD], -0.70; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.25; P = .003) and memory (MD, -0.77; 95% CI, -1.24 to -0.30; P = .002), with no correlation between total gray matter TSPO and these cognitive domains.\n",

      "Neurodevelopment can be precisely regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylations, noncoding RNAs, and histone modifications. Histone methylation was a reversible modification, catalyzed by histone methyltransferases and demethylases. So far, dozens of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) have been discovered, and they (members from KDM1 to KDM7 family) are important for neurodevelopment by regulating cellular processes, such as chromatin structure and gene transcription. The role of KDM5C and KDM7B in neural development is particularly important, and mutations in both genes are frequently found in human X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Functional disorders of specific KDMs, such as KDM1A can lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several KDMs can serve as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. At present, the function of KDMs in neurodegenerative diseases is not fully understood, so more comprehensive and profound studies are needed. Here, the role and mechanism of histone demethylases were summarized in neurodevelopment, and the potential of them was introduced in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "A series of salicylidene uracil (1-18) derived from 5-aminouracil and substituted salicylaldehydes were analyzed for cytotoxic activity and enzyme inhibitory potency. Nine out of eighteen derivatives (6-8, 10, 12-15, 18) are novel molecules synthesized for the first time in this work, and other derivatives were previously synthesized by our group. The compounds were characterized by Proton nuclear magnetic resonance, carbon nuclear magnetic resonance, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for their in vitro cytotoxicity against PC-3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma), A549 (human alveolar adenocarcinoma), and SHSY-5Y (human neuroblastoma) cancer cell lines and the nontumorigenic HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells) cell line.

      "Spatial navigation is a complex function involving the integration and manipulation of multisensory information. Using different navigation tasks, many promising results have been achieved on the specific functions of various brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal place area). Recently, it has been suggested that a non-aggregate network process involving multiple interacting brain regions may better characterize the neural basis of this complex function. This paper presents an integrative approach for constructing and analyzing the functionally-specific network for spatial navigation in the human brain. Briefly, this integrative approach consists of three major steps: 1) to identify brain regions important for spatial navigation (nodes definition); 2) to estimate functional connectivity between each pair of these regions and construct the connectivity matrix (network construction); 3) to investigate the topological properties (e.g., modularity and small worldness) of the resulting network (network analysis). The presented approach, from a network perspective, could help us better understand how our brain supports flexible navigation in complex and dynamic environments, and the revealed topological properties of the network can also provide important biomarkers for guiding early identification and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice.\n",
      "Early identification of cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial. Neurofilament, a potential biomarker for neurological disorders, has gained attention. Our study aims to investigate the relationship between serum neurofilament light (sNfL) levels and cognitive function in elderly individuals in the United States.\n",
      "This cross-sectional study analyzed data from participants aged 60 and above in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2014). We collected sNfL levels, cognitive function tests, sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and other variables. Weighted multiple linear regression models examined the relationship between ln(sNfL) and cognitive scores. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) visualization explored nonlinear relationships. The stratified analysis examined subgroups' ln(sNfL) and cognitive function association.\n",
      "The study included 446 participants (47.73% male). Participants with ln(sNfL) levels between 2.58 and 2.81 pg/mL (second quintile) performed relatively well in cognitive tests. After adjusting for multiple factors, ln(sNfL) levels were negatively correlated with cognitive function, with adjusted β (95% CI) as follows: immediate recall test (IRT): -0.763 (-1.301 to -0.224), delayed recall test (DRT): -0.308 (-0.576 to -0.04), animal fluency test (AFT): -1.616 (-2.639 to -0.594), and digit symbol substitution test (DSST): -2.790 (-4.369 to -1.21). RCS curves showed nonlinear relationships between ln(sNfL) and DRT, AFT, with inflection points around 2.7 pg/mL. The stratified analysis revealed a negative correlation between ln(sNfL) and cognition in specific subgroups with distinct features, with an interaction between diabetes and ln(sNfL).\n",

This article aims to provide a systematic review of the efficacy, and safety of lecanemab in slowing clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "A comprehensive search of various databases, including the National Institute of Health clinical trials registry, PubMed, and the Cochrane library, was conducted until July 2023 using the keywords lecanemab, BAN2401, and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, conference abstracts listed in the Cochrane database (including Embase) and drug information from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label were examined. Only clinical trials published in the English language were considered. In total, 107 articles were retrieved, and after thorough evaluation, three randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trials involving 2729 participants were included in the analysis.\n",
      "The FDA approved lecanemab for Alzheimer's disease in January 2023 which acts as a novel disease-modifying anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) human monoclonal antibody and is administered intravenously. Based on the clinical trials included in this review, lecanemab was found efficacious in reducing the accumulation of beta-amyloid and slowing down the cognitive decline and it was well tolerated. Lecanemab had a statistically significant change from baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAScog14), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL), and reductions in brain amyloid burden.

      "The Family-centered Function Focused Care (Fam-FFC) intervention, is a nurse-family care partnership model aimed to improve the physical and cognitive recovery in hospitalized persons living with Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) while improving the care partner's experiences. Discussions of patients' needs and preferences between nurses and the patient's close family members have been found to be useful in preventing excessive stress in persons with dementia, while lessening the anxiety of care partners. However, the efficacy of dementia-specific interventions is influenced in part by the degree to which the interventions are flexible and sensitive to the patient's and care-partner's condition, needs, and preferences, including cultural preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the cultural appropriateness of Fam-FFC using the Ecological Validity Model (EVM). This qualitative, descriptive study included 28 consented care partners drawn from a sample of 455 dyads enrolled in the Fam-FFC intervention. An interview guide was created based on the EVM. Participants provided demographic data. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyze transcribed interviews. The majority of the sample was female (79%), Non-Hispanic (96%) and half were married. One-half of the sample represented Black care partners and one-half were White. Seventy-nine percent lived with their family member with ADRD. Three major themes were identified from the thematic analysis including Care Partner Identity, Care Partner Preferences, and Goals of Care for functional recovery of their family member living with dementia. In this study care partners wanted more social services as well as home care that supported not just physical needs but also social and recreational needs. Findings from the study offer guidance on improving the Fam-FFC intervention including strengthening education and resources on partner self-care.\n",
      "Early postnatal life is a sensitive period of development that shapes brain structure and function later in life. Exposure to stress during this critical time window can alter brain development and may enhance the susceptibility to psychopathology and neurodegenerative disorders later in life. The developmental effects of early life stress (ELS) on synaptic function are not fully understood, but could provide mechanistic insights into how ELS modifies later brain function and disease risk. We here assessed the effects of ELS on synaptic function and composition in the hippocampus of male mice. Mice were subjected to ELS by housing dams and pups with limited bedding and nesting material from postnatal days (P) 2-9. Synaptic strength was measured in terms of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus at three different developmental stages: the early postnatal phase (P9), preadolescence (P21, at weaning) and adulthood at 3 months of age (3MO). Hippocampal synaptosome fractions were isolated from P9 and 3MO tissue and analyzed for protein content to assess postsynaptic composition. Finally, dendritic spine density was assessed in the DG at 3MO. At P9, ELS increased mEPSC frequency and amplitude. In parallel, synaptic composition was altered as PSD-95, GluA3 and GluN2B content were significantly decreased. The increased mEPSC frequency was sustained up to 3MO, at which age, GluA3 content was significantly increased. No differences were found in dendritic spine density. These findings highlight how ELS affects the development of hippocampal synapses, which could provide valuable insight into mechanisms how ELS alters brain function later in life.\n",

      "Addressing the seminal pathophysiology in Alzheimer disease (AD) is the next logical focus for effective intervention, given the initial disappointing and more recent possibly encouraging results of monoclonal antibody trials. Endothelial cell dysfunction-induced blood-brain barrier leak with associated prolonged capillary mean transit time (cMTT) and glymphatic outflow dysfunction is the most proximal events in the degeneration cascade. Sensitive and reproducible markers are required to both identify early disease and assess future treatment trial outcomes. Two participants, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and one with AD, were evaluated clinically prior to MRI in this small case series report. From seven 3D turbo gradient and spin echo (TGSE) pulsed arterial spin echo (PASL) MRI sequences six homologous region of interest in bitemporal, bifrontal, and biparietal lobes for each sequence were examined and plotted against time.

      "Blood-based analysis of amyloid-β is increasingly applied to incrementally establish diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's disease. To this aim, it is necessary to determine factors that can alter blood-based concentrations of amyloid-β. We cross-sectionally analysed amyloid-β-40 and amyloid-β-42 concentrations and the 40/42 ratio in 440 community-dwelling adults and associations with body mass index, waist-to-height ratio and body composition assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Body mass index and waist-to-height ratio were inversely associated with plasma amyloid-β-42 concentrations. Body fat mass, but not body cell mass and extracellular mass, was inversely associated with amyloid-β-42 levels. The results indicate that plasma concentrations of amyloid-β-42 are lower in those with increased body mass index and body fat, and associations with amyloid-β-40 did not reach significance after controlling for multiple testing. The findings support the use of body mass index as an easy-to-measure factor that should be accounted for in diagnostic models for plasma amyloid-β.\n",

      "Amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) are Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers that interact in a complex manner to induce most of the cognitive and brain alterations observed in this disease. Since the neuronal cytoskeleton is a common downstream pathological target of tau and Aβ, which mostly lead to augmented microtubule instability, the administration of microtubule stabilizing agents (MSAs) can protect against their pathological actions. However, the effectiveness of MSAs is still uncertain due to their state-dependent negative effects; thus, evaluating their specific actions in different pathological or physiological conditions is required. We evaluated whether epothilone-D (Epo-D), a clinically used MSA, rescues from the functional and behavioral alterations produced by intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ, the presence of P-tau, or their combination in rTg4510 mice. We also explored the side effects of Epo-D. To do so, we evaluated hippocampal-dependent spatial memory with the Hebb-Williams maze, hippocampal CA1 integrity and the intrinsic and synaptic properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons with the patch-clamp technique. Aβ and P-tau mildly impaired memory retrieval, but produced contrasting effects on intrinsic excitability. When Aβ and P-tau were combined, the alterations in excitability and spatial reversal learning (i.e., cognitive flexibility) were exacerbated. Interestingly, Epo-D prevented most of the impairments induced Aβ and P-tau alone and combined. However, Epo-D also exhibited some side effects depending on the prevailing pathological or physiological condition, which should be considered in future preclinical and translational studies. Although we did not perform extensive histopathological evaluations or measured microtubule stability, our findings show that MSAs can rescue the consequences of AD-like conditions but otherwise be harmful if administered at a prodromal stage of the disease.\n",

      "Macroautophagy/autophagy receptors are essential for the recognition and clearance of specific cargos by selective autophagy, which is essential for maintaining MAPT proteostasis. Previous studies have implicated different autophagy receptors in directing distinct species of MAPT to autophagy, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Here we examine how the autophagy receptors NBR1 and SQSTM1 differentially associate with specific forms of MAPT. In primary neurons depletion of NBR1, unlike depletion of SQSTM1, significantly increased phosphorylated MAPT levels. The specificity of the interactions was confirmed using in vitro binding assays with purified proteins. We provide direct evidence that the co-chaperone BAG3 promotes the preferential association of NBR1 with monomeric MAPT and SQSTM1 with oligomeric MAPT. Using an in vitro affinity-isolation assay, we show that SQSTM1 only binds to monomeric MAPT when BAG3 is absent and fails to bind when BAG3 is present. The opposite is true of NBR1; its association with monomeric MAPT was dependent on the presence of BAG3. Interestingly, in Alzheimer disease brain the association of NBR1 with BAG3 was significantly decreased. In a mouse model, ablation of BAG3 in neural cells disrupted the association of NBR1 with phosphorylated MAPT and led to increased levels of phosphorylated and oligomeric MAPT. Overall, our results uncover a novel role for BAG3 in regulating the specificity of selective autophagy receptors in targeting different species of MAPT and provide compelling evidence that BAG3 plays a key role in maintaining MAPT proteostasis.\n",
      "Multiple-cause-of-death data have not yet been applied to the study of racial/ethnic differences in causal chains of events leading to death, nor they have been used to examine racial/ethnic disparities in cause-of-death certification. We use publicly available 2019 US death certificate data to reassemble chains of morbid events leading to death. From them, we construct and analyze directed multiple cause of death networks by race and sex of deaths aged 60+. Three perspectives to measure disparities are employed: (i) relative prevalence of cause-of-death-pairs, (ii) strength of associations between diseases, (iii) similarities in transition matrices. Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) had overall lower prevalence of cause of death pairs, Hispanics (HIS) were burdened more by alcohol-related mortality and Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) exceeded in transitions to cerebrovascular diseases. Lower similarity was observed in transitions to external causes of death, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, pulmonary heart diseases, interstitial respiratory diseases, and diseases of the liver. After excluding rare diseases, the similarity further decreased for ill-defined conditions, diabetes mellitus, other cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the pleura, and anemia.

      "Cognitive deficits are a common comorbidity with neurological disorders and normal aging. Inflammation is associated with multiple diseases including classical neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which over half of all patients experience some form of cognitive deficits. Other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) including frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and psychological disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), and even normal aging all have cytokine-associated reductions in cognitive function. Thus, there is likely commonality between these secondary cognitive deficits and inflammation. Neurological disorders are increasingly associated with substantial neuroinflammation, in which CNS-resident cells secrete cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α and interleukins (ILs) including IL-1β and IL-6. CNS-resident cells also respond to a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines, which can have both direct effects on neurons by changing the expression of ion channels and perturbing electrical properties, as well as indirect effects through glia-glia and immune-glia cross-talk. There is significant overlap in these cytokine and chemokine expression profiles across diseases, with TNFα and IL-6 strongly associated with cognitive deficits in multiple disorders. Here, we review the involvement of various cytokines and chemokines in AD, MS, FTLD, PD, TBI, MDD, and normal aging in the absence of dementia. We propose that the neuropsychiatric phenotypes observed in these disorders may be at least partially attributable to a dysregulation of immunity resulting in pathological cytokine and chemokine expression from both CNS-resident and non-resident cells.\n",

The participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging using a three-dimensional multi-dynamic multi-echo sequence on a 3-T scanner. We employed a deep neural network (QSMnet+) and used automatic segmentation software based on FreeSurfer v6.0 to extract anatomical labels and volumes of interest in the cortex.

      "Various diseases, including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, have been reported to be linked to amyloid. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish amyloid from non-amyloid proteins or peptides. While experimental approaches are typically preferred, they are costly and time-consuming. In this study, we have developed a machine learning framework called iAMY-RECMFF to discriminate amyloidgenic from non-amyloidgenic peptides. In our model, we first encoded the peptide sequences using the residue pairwise energy content matrix. We then utilized Pearson's correlation coefficient and distance correlation to extract useful information from this matrix. Additionally, we employed an improved similarity network fusion algorithm to integrate features from different perspectives. The Fisher approach was adopted to select the optimal feature subset. Finally, the selected features were inputted into a support vector machine for identifying amyloidgenic peptides. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the identification of amyloidgenic peptides compared to existing predictors. This suggests that our method may serve as a powerful tool in identifying amyloidgenic peptides.

The last follow-up information on dementia was available from October 2021.\n",
      "The age at the end of the follow-up was 61.7 ± 17.1 years, and 53% were women. Overall, we observed 9701 (4.4%) dementia, 6323 (2.9%) AD and 1918 (0.7%) VD cases. Individuals with CVD had a higher risk of developing dementia than unexposed individuals. In the multivariable-adjusted Cox models, stroke was most strongly associated with dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-1.8). CVD was more strongly associated with VD than with AD. Individuals with HF and MI had an increased risk of AD (HF: HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.19; MI: HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18). AF was associated with VD (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.42-1.77), but not with AD (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-1.09). Clinical characteristics, such as diabetes, smoking and alcohol abuse, were associated with both types of dementia.\n",

Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pooled RR and 95% CIs were generated using random-effect models.\n",
      "The meta-analysis included 18 cohort studies conducted in 8 countries and involving 4,975,325 individuals. The pooled RR for the association between glaucoma and all-cause dementia was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.10 - 1.57; I2 = 95%). The pooled RRs for the associations of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and Parkinson's disease were 1.29 (95% CI, 1.01 - 1.65; I2 = 96%) and 1.23 (95% CI, 0.68 - 2.24; I2 = 73%), respectively.

Data were analyzed using linear and logistic regression models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\n",
      "Across the AD clinical spectrum, plasma Aβ40 and NfL increased, whereas Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio decreased. Plasma t-tau was higher in people with AD dementia than those with MCI or normal cognition. Plasma NfL outperformed other biomarkers in differentiating AD from normal cognition (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.75), but all plasma biomarkers performed poorly to distinguish MCI from normal cognition (AUC <0.60). Plasma NfL in combination with age, sex, education, and APOE genotype yielded the AUC of 0.87 for differentiating between AD and normal cognition, 0.79 between AD and MCI, and 0.64 between MCI and normal cognition.\n",
      "In this Chinese population, AD plasma biomarkers vary by age, sex, and APOE genotype. Plasma Aβ, t-tau, and NfL differ across the AD clinical spectrum, and plasma NfL appears to be superior to plasma Aβ and t-tau for defining the clinical spectrum.\n",

Sarcopenia was defined according to diagnostic algorithm recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Components of sarcopenia were grip strength, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and gait speed. They were further aggregated into a score (0-3 points) by counting the numbers of limited components. Multi-nominal logistic regression was applied.\n",
      "Probable sarcopenia (i.e., reduced grip strength) was observed in 9.6% of the patients, and 3.5% were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Patients with faster gait speed showed less likelihood of MCI (odds ratio [OR]: 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.90) and AD (OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.60). One or more limited sarcopenia components was associated with worse cognitive function. After adjusting for potential confounders, the association remained significant only for AD (OR 4.29, 95% CI 1.45-11.92).\n",

      "Neurodegenerative disease (ND) incidence has recently increased due to improved life expectancy. Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most prevalent NDs. Both diseases are poly genetic, multifactorial and heterogenous. Preventive medicine, a healthy diet, exercise, and controlling comorbidities may delay the onset. After the diseases are diagnosed, therapy is needed to slow progression. Recent studies show that local, peripheral and age-related inflammation accelerates NDs' onset and progression. Patients with autoimmune disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) could be at higher risk of developing AD or PD. However, no increase in ND incidence has been reported if the patients are adequately diagnosed and treated. Autoantibodies against abnormal tau, β amyloid and α- synuclein have been encountered in AD and PD and may be protective. This discovery led to the proposal of immune-based therapies for AD and PD involving monoclonal antibodies, immunization/ vaccines, pro-inflammatory cytokine inhibition and anti-inflammatory cytokine addition. All the different approaches have been analysed here. Future perspectives on new therapeutic strategies for both disorders are concisely examined.\n",

      "The metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Alzheimer's disease share several pathological features, including insulin resistance, abnormal protein processing, mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated inflammation and oxidative stress. The MetS constitutes elevated fasting glucose, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension and increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, but the precise mechanism remains elusive. Insulin resistance, which develops from a diet rich in sugars and saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, is shared by the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are also a point of convergence, with altered dynamics in both the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of palmitate- and glucose-induced insulin resistance in the brain and its potential link through EVs to Alzheimer's disease is unknown. We demonstrate that palmitate and high glucose induce insulin resistance and amyloid precursor protein phosphorylation in primary rat embryonic cortical neurons and human cortical stem cells. Palmitate also triggers insulin resistance in oligodendrocytes, the supportive glia of the brain. Palmitate and glucose enhance amyloid precursor protein secretion from cortical neurons via EVs, which induce tau phosphorylation when added to naïve neurons. Additionally, EVs from palmitate-treated oligodendrocytes enhance insulin resistance in recipient neurons. Overall, our findings suggest a novel theory underlying the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in MetS mediated by EVs, which spread Alzheimer's pathology and insulin resistance.\n",

      "The main role of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. There is a long history of investigations regarding the inhibition of CETP as a target for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Initially, the potential effect on cardiovascular events of CETP inhibitors was hypothesized to be mediated by their ability to increase HDL cholesterol, but, based on evidence from anacetrapib and the newest CETP inhibitor, obicetrapib, it is now understood to be primarily due to reducing LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Nevertheless, evidence is also mounting that other roles of HDL, including its promotion of cholesterol efflux, as well as its apolipoprotein composition and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-diabetic properties, may play important roles in several diseases beyond cardiovascular disease, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and sepsis. Furthermore, although Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that higher HDL cholesterol is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), excess risk of AMD was absent in all CETP inhibitor randomized controlled trial data comprising over 70,000 patients. In fact, certain HDL subclasses may, in contrast, be beneficial for treating the retinal cholesterol accumulation that occurs with AMD. This review describes the latest biological evidence regarding the relationship between HDL and CETP inhibition for Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sepsis, and AMD.\n",
      "Actin cytoskeleton is critical for neuronal shape and function. Drebrin and formins are key regulators of neuronal actin networks. Neuron-specific drebrin A is highly enriched in dendritic spines (postsynaptic terminals) of mature excitatory neurons. Decreased levels of drebrin in dendritic spines is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and other complex disorders, which calls for better understanding of its regulatory functions. Drebrin A was previously shown to inhibit actin nucleation and bundling by the diaphanous formin-2 (mDia2) - an actin nucleator that is involved in the initiation of dendritic spines. Characterization of the molecular binding interface between mDia2 and drebrin is necessary to better understand the functional consequences of this interaction and its biological relevance. Prior work suggested a multi-pronged interface between mDia2 and drebrin, which involves both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the drebrin molecule. Here we used mass spectrometry analysis, deletion mutagenesis, and an array of synthetic peptides of neuronal drebrin A to map its formin-binding interface. The mDia2-interacting interface on drebrin was narrowed down to three highly conserved 9-16 residue sequences that were used to identify some of the key residues involved in this interaction. Deletion of the C-terminal region of drebrin greatly reduces its binding to mDia2 and the extent of its inhibition of formin-driven actin assembly. Moreover, our experiments with formins from different subfamilies showed that drebrin is a specific rather than general inhibitor of these proteins. This work contributes to a molecular level understanding of the formin-drebrin interaction and will help to unravel its biological significance.\n",
      "Disco Interacting Protein 2 Homolog A (DIP2A) is expressed throughout the body and abundantly expressed in the brain tissue. It is activated by Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1). Activated DIP2A interacts with several pathways, such as AMPK/mTOR and AKT pathways, to contribute to many biological processes, such as oxidative stress, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis. Dysregulated DIP2A activation has been implicated in numerous processes in the brain. If the upstream pathways of DIP2A remain globally unexplored, many proteins, including cortactin, AMPK, and AKT, have been identified as its downstream targets in the literature. Recent studies have linked DIP2A to a variety of mechanisms in many types of brain disorders, suggesting that regulation of DIP2A could provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for brain disorders. In this review, we comprehensively summarized and discussed the current research on DIP2A in various brain disorders, such as stroke, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), dyslexia, and glioma.\n",

      "The molecular mechanisms that trigger Tau aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain elusive. Fungi, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), can be found in brain samples from patients with AD. Here, we show that the yeast protein Ure2p from S. cerevisiae interacts with Tau and facilitates its aggregation. The Ure2p-seeded Tau fibrils are more potent in seeding Tau and causing neurotoxicity in vitro. When injected into the hippocampus of Tau P301S transgenic mice, the Ure2p-seeded Tau fibrils show enhanced seeding activity compared with pure Tau fibrils. Strikingly, intracranial injection of Ure2p fibrils promotes the aggregation of Tau and cognitive impairment in Tau P301S mice. Furthermore, intranasal infection of S. cerevisiae in the nasal cavity of Tau P301S mice accelerates the aggregation of Tau. Together, these observations indicate that the yeast protein Ure2p initiates Tau pathology. Our results provide a conceptual advance that non-mammalian prions may cross-seed mammalian prion-like proteins.\n",

Fourteen brains were obtained over 2 years from women with documented IPV (aged 3rd-8th decade; median, 4th) and complex histories including prior TBI in 6, nonfatal strangulation in 4, cerebrovascular, neurological, and/or psychiatric conditions in 13, and epilepsy in 7. At autopsy, all had TBI stigmata (old and/or recent). In addition, white matter regions vulnerable to diffuse axonal injury showed perivascular and parenchymal iron deposition and microgliosis in some subjects. Six cases had evidence of cerebrovascular disease (lacunes and/or chronic infarcts). Regarding neurodegenerative disease pathologies, Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change was present in a single case (8th decade), with no chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathologic change (CTE-NC) identified in any. Findings from this initial series then prompted similar exploration in an expanded case series of 70 archival IPV cases (aged 2nd-9th decade; median, 4th) accrued from multiple international institutions. In this secondary case series, we again found evidence of vascular and white matter pathologies. However, only limited neurodegenerative proteinopathies were encountered in the oldest subjects, none meeting consensus criteria for CTE-NC. These observations from this descriptive exploratory study reinforce a need to consider broad co-morbid and neuropathological substrates contributing to brain health outcomes in the context of IPV, some of which may be potentially modifiable.\n",

      "Aberrant protein aggregation jeopardizes cellular functionality and underlies the development of a myriad of late-onset maladies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Accordingly, molecules that mitigate the toxicity of hazardous protein aggregates are of great interest as potential future therapeutics. Here we asked whether a small peptide, composed of five amino acids (5MER peptide) that was derived from the human pro-inflammatory CD44 protein, could protect model nematodes from the toxicity of aggregative proteins that underlie the development of neurodegenerative disorders in humans. We found that the 5MER peptide mitigates the toxicity that stems from both; the AD-causing Aβ peptide and a stretch of poly-glutamine that is accountable for the development of several disorders including HD, while minimally affecting lifespan. This protection was dependent on the activity of aging-regulating transcription factors and associated with enhanced Aβ and polyQ35-YFP aggregation. A transcriptomic analysis unveiled that the peptide modifies signaling pathways, thereby modulating the expression of various genes, including these, which are known as protein homeostasis (proteostasis) regulators such as txt-13 and modifiers of proteasome activity. The knockdown of txt-13 protects worms from proteotoxicity to the same extent as the 5MER peptide, suggesting that the peptide activates the transcellular chaperone signaling to promote proteostasis. Together, our results propose that the 5MER peptide should be considered as a component of future therapeutic cocktails for the treatment of neurodegenerative maladies.\n",
      "Neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging are often accompanied by cognitive decline and gut microbiota disorder. But the impact of gut microbiota on these cognitive disturbances remains incompletely understood. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are major metabolites produced by gut microbiota during the digestion of dietary fiber, serving as an energy source for gut epithelial cells and/or circulating to other organs, such as the liver and brain, through the bloodstream. SCFAs have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and played crucial roles in brain metabolism, with potential implications in mediating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanisms that SCFAs might influence psychological functioning, including affective and cognitive processes and their neural basis, have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the dietary sources which determine these SCFAs production was not thoroughly evaluated yet. This comprehensive review explores the production of SCFAs by gut microbiota, their transportation through the gut-brain axis, and the potential mechanisms by which they influence age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Also, the review discusses the importance of dietary fiber sources and the challenges associated with harnessing dietary-derived SCFAs as promoters of neurological health in elderly individuals. Overall, this study suggests that gut microbiota-derived SCFAs and/or dietary fibers hold promise as potential targets and strategies for addressing age-related neurodegenerative disorders.\n",
      "The multifactorial nature of some diseases, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, frequently requires the use of several drugs. These drug cocktails are not without drawbacks in terms of increased adverse effects, drug-drug interactions or low adherence to treatment. The use of pleiotropic drugs, which combine, within a single molecule, several activities directed against distinct therapeutic targets, makes it possible to overcome some of these problems. In addition, these pleiotropic drugs generally lead to the expression of a synergy of effects, sometimes greater than that observed with a combination of drugs. This article will review, through recent examples, the different kinds of pleiotropic drugs being studied or already present on the market of medicines, with a focus on the structural aspect of such drug design.\n",

Despite some pan-JNK inhibitors reaching clinical trials, no JNK-targeted therapies have achieved market approval. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a sophisticated virtual screening approach. We begin with an energy-based screening, subsequently integrating a variety of rescoring techniques. These encompass glide docking scores, MM/GBSA, and artificial scoring mechanisms such as DeepDock and advanced Graph Neural Networks. This virtual screening workflow is designed to evaluate and identify potential small-molecule inhibitors with high binding affinity. We have implemented a virtual screening workflow to identify potential candidate molecules. This process has resulted in the selection of ten molecules.

      "Psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders are amongst the most prevalent and debilitating diseases, but current treatments either have low success rates, greatly due to the low permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and/or are connected to severe side effects. Hence, new strategies are extremely important, and here is where liposome-derived nanosystems come in. Niosomes, transfersomes, and ethosomes are nanometric vesicular structures that allow drug encapsulation, protecting them from degradation, and increasing their solubility, permeability, brain targeting, and bioavailability. This review highlighted the great potential of these nanosystems for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. Studies regarding the encapsulation of synthetic and natural-derived molecules in these systems, for intravenous, oral, transdermal, or intranasal administration, have led to an increased brain bioavailability when compared to conventional pharmaceutical forms. Moreover, the developed formulations proved to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, including brain neurotransmitter level restoration and brain oxidative status improvement, and improved locomotor activity or enhancement of recognition and working memories in animal models. Hence, albeit being relatively new technologies, niosomes, transfersomes, and ethosomes have already proven to increase the brain bioavailability of psychoactive drugs, leading to increased effectiveness and decreased side effects, showing promise as future therapeutics.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorders worldwide. Its pathologic features include massive neuroinflammation with abnormal deposition of β-amyloid peptide in the cerebral tissues leading to degeneration of the brain neurons. Adverse effects associated with the traditional drugs used for the treatment of this pathological condition have directed the research efforts towards searching for alternative effective agents with minimal adverse effects. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential ameliorative effects of dapagliflozin and/or hesperidin on Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in rats. In a rodent model of AD, the effect of dapagliflozin with or without hesperidin on the biochemical parameters and the behavioral tests as well as the histopathological parameters was determined. Each of dapagliflozin and hesperidin restored the behavioral tests to the reference values, augmented the antioxidant defense mechanisms, ameliorated the neuronal inflammatory responses, combatted the changes in Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)/High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein signaling and receptors of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) levels, and restored the balance between the apoptotic signals and autophagy in the hippocampal tissues. Additionally, both agents exhibited an outstanding ability to combat LPS-induced perturbations in the histopathological and electron microscopic image of the brain tissues. These favorable effects were significantly encountered in the group treated with dapagliflozin/hesperidin combination when compared versus animals treated with either dapagliflozin or hesperidin. In conclusion, inhibition of the hippocampal HMGB1/TLR4/RAGE signaling, the pro-inflammatory axis, and apoptosis alongside augmentation of the antioxidant defenses and autophagy can be regarded as beneficial effects by which dapagliflozin/hesperidin combination may combat LPS-triggered AD.\n",

      "The investigation of monoterpenes as natural products has gained significant attention in the search for new pharmacological agents due to their ability to exhibit a wide range in biological activities, including antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, antispasmodic, hypotensive, and vasodilating properties. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal their antidepressant, anxiolytic, and memory-enhancing effects in experimental dementia and Parkinson's disease. Chemical modification of natural substances by conjugation with various synthetic components is a modern method of obtaining new biologically active compounds. The discovery of new potential drugs among monoterpene derivatives is a progressive avenue within experimental pharmacology, offering a promising approach for the therapy of diverse pathological conditions. Biologically active substances such as monoterpenes, for example, borneol, camphor, geraniol, pinene, and thymol, are used to synthesize compounds with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsive, antidepressant, anti-Alzheimer's, antiparkinsonian, antiviral and antibacterial (antituberculosis) properties. Myrtenal is a perspective monoterpenoid with therapeutic potential in various fields of medicine. Its chemical modifications often lead to new or more pronounced biological effects. As an example, the conjugation of myrtenal with the established pharmacophore adamantane enables the augmentation of several of its pivotal properties. Myrtenal-adamantane derivatives exhibited a variety of beneficial characteristics, such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, anxiolytic, and neuroprotective properties, which are worth examining in more detail and at length.\n",
      "The human brain is composed of nearly one hundred billion neurons and an equal number of glial cells, including macroglia, i.e., astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain. In the last few decades, compelling evidence has revealed that glial cells are far more active and complex than previously thought. In particular, astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell population, not only take part in brain development, metabolism, and defense against pathogens and insults, but they also affect sensory, motor, and cognitive functions by constantly modulating synaptic activity. Not surprisingly, astrocytes are actively involved in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and other neurological disorders like brain tumors, in which they rapidly become reactive and mediate neuroinflammation. Reactive astrocytes acquire or lose specific functions that differently modulate disease progression and symptoms, including cognitive impairments. Astrocytes express several types of ion channels, including K\n",

      "The monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4; Slc16a3) is expressed in the central nervous system, notably by astrocytes. It is implicated in lactate release and the regulation of glycolytic flux. Whether its expression varies during normal and/or pathological aging is unclear. As the presence of its mature transcript in the brain of young and old mice was determined, an unexpectedly longer RT-PCR fragment was detected in the mouse frontal cortex and hippocampus at 12 vs. 3 months of age. Cultured astrocytes expressed the expected 516 base pair (bp) fragment but treatment with IL-1β to mimic inflammation as can occur during aging led to the additional expression of a 928 bp fragment like that seen in aged mice. In contrast, cultured pericytes (a component of the blood-brain barrier) only exhibited the 516 bp fragment. Intriguingly, cultured endothelial cells constitutively expressed both fragments. When RT-PCR was performed on brain subregions of an Alzheimer mouse model (APPswePS1dE9), no fragment was detected at 3 months, while only the 928 bp fragment was present at 12 months. Sequencing of MCT4 RT-PCR products revealed the presence of a remaining intron between exon 2 and 3, giving rise to the longer fragment detected by RT-PCR. These results unravel the existence of intron retention for the MCT4 gene in the central nervous system. Such alternative splicing appears to increase with age in the brain and might be prominent in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Hence, further studies in vitro and in vivo of intron 2 retention in the Slc16a3 gene transcript are required for adequate characterization concerning the biological roles of Slc16a3 isoforms in the context of aging and Alzheimer's disease pathology.\n",

      "Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurodegenerative diseases result from progressive damage to nerve cells in the brain or peripheral nervous system connections that are essential for cognition, coordination, strength, sensation, and mobility. Dysfunction of these brain and nerve functions is associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and motor neuron disease. In addition to these, 50% of people living with HIV develop a spectrum of cognitive, motor, and/or mood problems collectively referred to as HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) despite the widespread use of a combination of antiretroviral therapies. Neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter systems have a pathological correlation and play a critical role in developing neurodegenerative diseases. Each of these diseases has a unique pattern of dysregulation of the neurotransmitter system, which has been attributed to different forms of cell-specific neuronal loss. In this review, we will focus on a discussion of the regulation of dopaminergic and cholinergic systems, which are more commonly disturbed in neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, we will provide evidence for the hypothesis that disturbances in neurotransmission contribute to the neuronal loss observed in neurodegenerative disorders. Further, we will highlight the critical role of dopamine as a mediator of neuronal injury and loss in the context of NeuroHIV. This review will highlight the need to further investigate neurotransmission systems for their role in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders.\n",

      "In individuals with Alzheimer's disease, the brain exhibits elevated levels of IL-1β and oxygenated cholesterol molecules (oxysterols). This study aimed to investigate the effects of side-chain oxysterols on IL-1β expression using HMC3 microglial cells and ApoE-deficient mice. Treatment of HMC3 cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHChol) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHChol) led to increased IL-1β expression at the transcript and protein levels. Additionally, these oxysterols upregulated the surface expression of MHC II, a marker of activated microglia. Immunohistochemistry performed on the mice showed increased microglial expression of IL-1β and MHC II when fed a high-cholesterol diet. However, cholesterol and 24s-hydroxycholesterol did not increase IL-1β transcript levels or MHC II expression. The extent of IL-1β increase induced by 25OHChol and 27OHChol was comparable to that caused by oligomeric β-amyloid, and the IL-1β expression induced by the oxysterols was not impaired by polymyxin B, which inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1β expression. Both oxysterols enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and Src, and inhibition of these kinase pathways with pharmacological inhibitors suppressed the expression of IL-1β and MHC II. The pharmacological agents chlorpromazine and cyclosporin A also impaired the oxysterol-induced expression of IL-1β and upregulation of MHC II. Overall, these findings suggest that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism leading to elevated levels of side-chain oxysterols, such as 25OHChol and 27OHChol, can activate microglia to secrete IL-1β through a mechanism amenable to pharmacologic intervention. The activation of microglia and subsequent neuroinflammation elicited by the immune oxysterols can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "The field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has witnessed recent breakthroughs in the development of disease-modifying biologics and diagnostic markers. While immunotherapeutic interventions have provided much-awaited solutions, nucleic acid-based tools represent other avenues of intervention; however, these approaches are costly and invasive, and they have serious side effects. Previously, we have shown in AD animal models that tolfenamic acid (TA) can lower the expression of AD-related genes and their products and subsequently reduce pathological burden and improve cognition. Using TA as a scaffold and the zinc finger domain of SP1 as a pharmacophore, we developed safer and more potent brain-penetrating analogs that interfere with sequence-specific DNA binding at transcription start sites and predominantly modulate the expression of SP1 target genes. More importantly, the proteome of treated cells displayed ~75% of the downregulated products as SP1 targets. Specific levels of SP1-driven genes and AD biomarkers such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau proteins were also decreased as part of this targeted systemic response. These small molecules, therefore, offer a viable alternative to achieving desired therapeutic outcomes by interfering with both amyloid and Tau pathways with limited off-target systemic changes.\n",

Moreover, sex has been a crucial point of discussion in understanding AD pathology. We aimed to demonstrate the sex-related disparities in the functional connectivity (FC) of the SN and LC in preclinical AD. A total of 89 cognitively normal patients with evidence of amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation ([18F] flutemetamol +) were recruited in the study. A seed-to-voxel analysis was conducted to measure the LC and SN rsFC differences between sexes. In addition, sex by Aβ interactive effects on FC values were analyzed with a general linear model. There were statistically significant sex by regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) interactions in the LC FC with the parietal, frontal, and occipital cortices. Moreover, there was a significant sex by global SUVR interaction in the SN FC with the temporal cortex. The findings suggest that there are differential patterns of LC FC and SN FC in males and females with preclinical AD, which interact with regional Aβ deposition.\n",

This network is trained on the publicly available Kaggle dataset, and it illustrated impressive results with an accuracy of 99.06%, precision of 99.06%, recall of 99.14%, and F1-score of 99.1%. Furthermore, a comparative study is also conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method against various state-of-the-art techniques on diverse datasets. The proposed method demonstrated superior performance, outperforming other published methods when applied to the Kaggle dataset.\n",

      "Lewy body dementia (LBD) is an often misdiagnosed and mistreated neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by the emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms followed by motor impairment. LBD falls within an undefined range between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) due to the potential pathogenic synergistic effects of tau, beta-amyloid (Aβ), and alpha-synuclein (αsyn). A lack of reliable and relevant animal models hinders the elucidation of the molecular characteristics and phenotypic consequences of these interactions. Here, the goal was to evaluate whether the viral-mediated overexpression of αsyn in adult hTau and APP/PS1 mice or the overexpression of tau in Line 61 hThy1-αsyn mice resulted in pathology and behavior resembling LBD. The transgenes were injected intravenously via the tail vein using AAV-PHP.eB in 3-month-old hThy1-αsyn, hTau, or APP/PS1 mice that were then aged to 6-, 9-, and 12-months-old for subsequent phenotypic and histological characterization. Although we achieved the widespread expression of αsyn in hTau and tau in hThy1-αsyn mice, no αsyn pathology in hTau mice and only mild tau pathology in hThy1-αsyn mice was observed. Additionally, cognitive, motor, and limbic behavior phenotypes were not affected by overexpression of the transgenes. Furthermore, our APP/PS1 mice experienced premature deaths starting at 3 months post-injection (MPI), therefore precluding further analyses at later time points. An evaluation of the remaining 3-MPI indicated no αsyn pathology or cognitive and motor behavioral changes. Taken together, we conclude that the overexpression of αsyn in hTau and APP/PS1 mice and tau in hThy1-αsyn mice does not recapitulate the behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes observed in LBD.\n",
      "Several studies have demonstrated accelerated brain aging in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Previous studies have also reported that facial asymmetry increases with age. Because obtaining facial images is much easier than obtaining brain images, the aim of this work was to investigate whether AD exhibits accelerated aging patterns in facial asymmetry. We developed new facial asymmetry measures to compare Alzheimer's patients with healthy controls. A three-dimensional camera was used to capture facial images, and 68 facial landmarks were identified using an open-source machine-learning algorithm called OpenFace. A standard image registration method was used to align the three-dimensional original and mirrored facial images. This study used the registration error, representing landmark superimposition asymmetry distances, to examine 29 pairs of landmarks to characterize facial asymmetry. After comparing the facial images of 150 patients with AD with those of 150 age- and sex-matched non-demented controls, we found that the asymmetry of 20 landmarks was significantly different in AD than in the controls (\n",
      "Many potential immune therapeutic targets are similarly affected in adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as in a seemingly distinct Niemann-Pick type C disease with primarily juvenile onset. This strongly argues for an overlap in pathogenic mechanisms. The commonly researched immune targets include various immune cell subsets, such as microglia, peripheral macrophages, and regulatory T cells (Tregs); the complement system; and other soluble factors. In this review, we compare these neurodegenerative diseases from a clinical point of view and highlight common pathways and mechanisms of protein aggregation, neurodegeneration, and/or neuroinflammation that could potentially lead to shared treatment strategies for overlapping immune dysfunctions in these diseases. These approaches include but are not limited to immunisation, complement cascade blockade, microbiome regulation, inhibition of signal transduction, Treg boosting, and stem cell transplantation.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by plaque agglomeration and entanglement in several areas of the neural cells, which leads to apoptosis. The main etiology of AD is senile dementia, which is linked to amyloid-beta (Aβ) deregulation and tau perivascular pathogeny. Hyperphosphorylated tau has a propensity for microtubules, which elevate the instability and tau-protein congregates, leading to accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Tau hyperphosphorylation is susceptible to GSK-3, which has led to an emerging hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of AD. Accordingly, attempts have been made to conduct investigations and achieve further advancements on new analogues capable of inhibiting the GSK-3 protein, which are currently in the clinical trials. In this analysis, we have evaluated certain GSK-3 inhibitor variants utilising scaffolding and framework devised techniques with pharmacological characteristics, accompanied by computational screenings (pharmacokinetics and docking). The structure-based designed analogues interacted effectively with the active amino acids of GSK-3β target protein. The in silico pharmacokinetic studies revealed their drug-like properties. The analogues with best interactions and binding scores will be considered in the future to completely demonstrate their potential relevance as viable GSK-3 inhibitors.\n",
      "Complex diseases that affect the functioning of the central nervous system pose a major problem for modern society. Among these, ischemic stroke (IS) holds a special place as one of the most common causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease (AD) ranks first among neurodegenerative diseases, drastically reducing brain activity and overall life quality and duration. Recent studies have shown that AD and IS share several common risk and pathogenic factors, such as an overlapping genomic architecture and molecular signature. In this review, we will summarize the genomics and RNA biology studies of IS and AD, discussing the interconnected nature of these pathologies. Additionally, we highlight specific genomic points and RNA molecules that can serve as potential tools in predicting the risks of diseases and developing effective therapies in the future.\n",
      "A \"building block\" is a key component that plays a substantial and critical function in the pharmaceutical research and development industry. Given its structural versatility and ability to undergo substitutions at both the amino and carboxyl groups, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a commonly used building block in pharmaceuticals. Therefore, it is great for the development of a wide range of novel molecules with potential medical applications. Anticancer, anti-Alzheimer's, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties have been observed in PABA compounds, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents in future clinical trials. PABA-based therapeutic chemicals as molecular targets and their usage in biological processes are the primary focus of this review study. PABA's unique features make it a strong candidate for inclusion in a massive chemical database of molecules having drug-like effects. Based on the current literature, further investigation is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PABA derivatives in clinical investigations and better understand the specific mechanism of action revealed by these compounds.\n",
      "Small vessel diseases (SVD) is an umbrella term including several entities affecting small arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and venules in the brain. One of the most relevant and prevalent SVDs is cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), whose pathological hallmark is the deposition of amyloid fragments in the walls of small cortical and leptomeningeal vessels. CAA frequently coexists with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and both are associated with cerebrovascular events, cognitive impairment, and dementia. CAA and AD share pathophysiological, histopathological and neuroimaging issues. The venular involvement in both diseases has been neglected, although both animal models and human histopathological studies found a deposition of amyloid beta in cortical venules. This review aimed to summarize the available information about venular involvement in CAA, starting from the biological level with the putative pathomechanisms of cerebral damage, passing through the definition of the peculiar angioarchitecture of the human cortex with the functional organization and consequences of cortical arteriolar and venular occlusion, and ending to the hypothesized links between cortical venular involvement and the main neuroimaging markers of the disease.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of AD progression is crucial for early intervention and personalized treatment planning. Although AD does not yet have a reliable therapy, several medications help slow down the disease's progression. However, more study is still needed to develop reliable methods for detecting AD and its phases. In the recent past, biomarkers associated with AD have been identified using neuroimaging methods. To uncover biomarkers, deep learning techniques have quickly emerged as a crucial methodology. A functional molecular imaging technique known as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) has been shown to be effective in assisting researchers in understanding the morphological and neurological alterations to the brain associated with AD. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also long dominated the field of AD progression and have been the subject of substantial research, while more recent approaches like vision transformers (ViT) have not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning (SSL) method to automatically acquire meaningful AD characteristics using the ViT architecture by pretraining the feature extractor using the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) and extreme learning machine (ELM) as classifier models. In this work, we examined a technique for predicting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD utilizing an SSL model which learns powerful representations from unlabeled 18F-FDG PET images, thus reducing the need for large-labeled datasets. In comparison to several earlier approaches, our strategy showed state-of-the-art classification performance in terms of accuracy (92.31%), specificity (90.21%), and sensitivity (95.50%). Then, to make the suggested model easier to understand, we highlighted the brain regions that significantly influence the prediction of MCI development. Our methods offer a precise and efficient strategy for predicting the transition from MCI to AD. In conclusion, this research presents a novel Explainable SSL-ViT model that can accurately predict AD progress based on 18F-FDG PET scans. SSL, attention, and ELM mechanisms are integrated into the model to make it more predictive and interpretable. Future research will enable the development of viable treatments for neurodegenerative disorders by combining brain areas contributing to projection with observed anatomical traits.\n",
      "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important task that facilitates the development of treatment and prevention strategies, and may potentially improve patient outcomes. Neuroimaging has shown great promise, including the amyloid-PET, which measures the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain-a hallmark of AD. It is desirable to train end-to-end deep learning models to predict the progression of AD for individuals at early stages based on 3D amyloid-PET. However, commonly used models are trained in a fully supervised learning manner, and they are inevitably biased toward the given label information. To this end, we propose a selfsupervised contrastive learning method to accurately predict the conversion to AD for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with 3D amyloid-PET. The proposed method, SMoCo, uses both labeled and unlabeled data to capture general semantic representations underlying the images. As the downstream task is given as classification of converters vs. non-converters, unlike the general self-supervised learning problem that aims to generate task-agnostic representations, SMoCo additionally utilizes the label information in the pre-training. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The results confirmed that the proposed method is capable of providing appropriate data representations, resulting in accurate classification. SMoCo showed the best classification performance over the existing methods, with AUROC = 85.17%, accuracy = 81.09%, sensitivity = 77.39%, and specificity = 82.17%. While SSL has demonstrated great success in other application domains of computer vision, this study provided the initial investigation of using a proposed self-supervised contrastive learning model, SMoCo, to effectively predict MCI conversion to AD based on 3D amyloid-PET.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging is a promising technique that combines the advantages of PET and MR to provide both functional and structural information of the brain. Deep learning (DL) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's neural networks. DL has been applied to various aspects of PET/MR imaging in AD, such as image segmentation, image reconstruction, diagnosis and prediction, and visualization of pathological features. In this review, we introduce the basic concepts and types of DL algorithms, such as feed forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and autoencoders. We then summarize the current applications and challenges of DL in PET/MR imaging in AD, and discuss the future directions and opportunities for automated diagnosis, predictions of models, and personalized medicine. We conclude that DL has great potential to improve the quality and efficiency of PET/MR imaging in AD, and to provide new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of this devastating disease.\n",

      "This nationwide cohort study was performed using Korean National Health Insurance Service data collected from 2006 to 2017. A total of 300,327 subjects aged ≥ 45 years with a history of cataract diagnosis but no previous diagnosis of dementia were analyzed. The relationship between cataract surgery and dementia was evaluated, applying a time-varying analysis to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values according to dementia. It was calculated via a multivariable Cox regression model, with adjustments for age, sex, visual acuity (VA), ocular and systemic comorbidities, and social factors (including body mass index, income, smoking, and drinking).\n",
      "In the multivariate analysis, the cataract surgery group showed a marginal difference in dementia development (HR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02-1.19]) because both cataract and dementia share common risk factors. However, in the subgroup analysis, men (HR 0.49 [95% CI 0.26-0.90]) and patients under 65 years of age (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.79-0.99]) in the group with cataract surgery and good VA showed a significantly lower incidence of dementia.\n",

      "Previous studies revealed that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) probably has a protective effect for preventing dementia in post-menopausal women. However, the results were still controversial. The association between cholesterol levels and incident dementia in older women is not fully understood either. We conducted a retrospective analysis on a cohort of non-demented women aged older than 50 years, which was registered in the History-based Artificial Intelligence Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System database from September 2015 to August 2021. We followed this cohort longitudinally to examine the rates of conversion to dementia. Using a Cox regression model, we investigated the impact of the quartile of total cholesterol (TC) levels on incident dementia, adjusting for age, sex, education, neuropsychiatric symptoms, neuropsychological assessments, HRT, as well as various vascular risk factors and medications. We examined a cohort of 787 participants, comprising 539 (68.5%) individuals who did not develop dementia (non-converters). Among these non-converters, 68 individuals (12.6%) were treated with HRT. By contrast, there were 248 (31.5%) who did develop dementia (converters). Among the converters, 28 individuals (11.3%) were treated with HRT. The average follow-up durations were 2.9 ± 1.5 and 3.3 ± 1.6 years for non-converters and converters, respectively. Compared to the lowest quartile of TC levels (<153), the hazard ratios (HR) for converting to dementia were 0.61, 0.58, and 0.58 for the second (153-176), third (177-201), and highest (>201) quartiles, respectively (all \n",

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop over a preclinical period of many years beginning in midlife. The prevalence of insulin resistance, a prominent risk factor for late-life dementia, also accelerates in middle-age. Consumption of berry fruits, including strawberries, has been shown to influence metabolism as well as cognitive performance suggesting potential to mitigate risk for dementia. In this controlled trial, we enrolled overweight middle-aged men and women with insulin resistance and subjective cognitive decline and performed a 12-week intervention with daily administration of whole-fruit strawberry powder. Diet records showed that participants in both groups maintained the prescribed abstinence from berry product consumption outside the study. We observed diminished memory interference (\n",

      "This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current literature regarding gut microbiota composition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to healthy controls. To identify the relevant studies, a thorough search of PubMed, Medline, and Embase was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Out of 5627 articles, 73 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility, which led to the inclusion of 42 studies (26 PD and 16 AD studies). The risk of bias assessment showed a medium risk in 32 studies (20 PD studies and 12 AD studies), a low risk in 9 studies (5 PD studies and 4 AD studies), and 1 PD study with a high risk. Among the PD studies, 22 out of 26 studies reported a different gut microbiota composition between the PD cases and the healthy controls, and 15 out of 16 AD studies reported differences in gut microbiota composition between the AD cases and the healthy controls. The PD and AD studies consistently identified the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria as prevalent in the gut microbiota in both the healthy groups and the case groups.

      "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contributes significantly to the death of people worldwide, especially the elderly. An essential feature of COPD is pulmonary inflammation, which results from long-term exposure to noxious substances from cigarette smoking and other environmental pollutants. Pulmonary inflammatory mediators spill over to the blood, leading to systemic inflammation, which is believed to play a significant role in the onset of a host of comorbidities associated with COPD. A substantial comorbidity of concern in COPD patients that is often overlooked in COPD management is cognitive impairment. The exact pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in COPD patients remains a mystery; however, hypoxia, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and cerebral manifestations of these conditions are believed to play crucial roles. Furthermore, the use of medications to treat cognitive impairment symptomatology in COPD patients has been reported to be associated with life-threatening adverse effects, hence the need for alternative medications with reduced side effects. In this Review, we aim to discuss the impact of cognitive impairment in COPD management and the potential mechanisms associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment in COPD patients. The promising roles of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) in improving cognitive deficits in COPD patients are also discussed. Interestingly, ω-3 PUFAs can potentially enhance the cognitive impairment symptomatology associated with COPD because they can modulate inflammatory processes, activate the antioxidant defence system, and promote amyloid-beta clearance from the brain. Thus, clinical studies are crucial to assess the efficacy of ω-3 PUFAs in managing cognitive impairment in COPD patients.\n",

      "The use of cannabinoids (substances contained specifically in hemp plants) for therapeutic purposes has received increased attention in recent years. Presently, attention is paid to two main cannabinoids: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). With respect to the psychotropic effects and dependence potential of THC (though it is very mild), its use is associated with certain restrictions, and thus the therapeutic properties of CBD are frequently emphasized because there are no limitations associated with the risk of dependence. Therefore, this review covers the main pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features of CBD (including characteristics of endocannabinoidome) with respect to its possible beneficial effects on selected diseases in clinical practice. A substantial part of the text deals with the main effects of CBD on aging, including Alzheimer's disease and related underlying mechanisms.\n",
      "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterized by progressive and irreversible neuronal loss, accompanied by a range of pathological pathways, including aberrant protein aggregation, altered energy metabolism, excitotoxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Some of the most common NDs include Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's Disease (HD). There are currently no available cures; there are only therapeutic approaches that ameliorate the progression of symptoms, which makes the search for new drugs and therapeutic targets a constant battle. Cyanobacteria are ancient prokaryotic oxygenic phototrophs whose long evolutionary history has resulted in the production of a plethora of biomedically relevant compounds with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, that can be valuable in this field. This review summarizes the major NDs and their pathophysiology, with a focus on the anti-neurodegenerative properties of cyanobacterial compounds and their main effects.\n",
      "Oxidative stress is a deteriorating condition that arises due to an imbalance between the reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant system or defense of the body. The key reasons for the development of such conditions are malfunctioning of various cell organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex, as well as physical and mental disturbances. The nervous system has a relatively high utilization of oxygen, thus making it particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress, which eventually leads to neuronal atrophy and death. This advances the development of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration-associated disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, dementia, and other memory disorders. It is imperative to treat such conditions as early as possible before they worsen and progress to irreversible damage. Oxidative damage can be negated by two mechanisms: improving the cellular defense system or providing exogenous antioxidants. Natural antioxidants can normally handle such oxidative stress, but they have limited efficacy. The valuable features of nanoparticles and/or nanomaterials, in combination with antioxidant features, offer innovative nanotheranostic tools as potential therapeutic modalities. Hence, this review aims to represent novel therapeutic approaches like utilizing nanoparticles with antioxidant properties and nanotheranostics as delivery systems for potential therapeutic applications in various neuroinflammation- and neurodegeneration-associated disease conditions.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, resulting in disability and mortality. The global incidence of AD is consistently surging. Although numerous therapeutic agents with promising potential have been developed, none have successfully treated AD to date. Consequently, the pursuit of novel methodologies to address neurodegenerative processes in AD remains a paramount endeavor. A particularly promising avenue in this search is optogenetics, enabling the manipulation of neuronal activity. In recent years, research attention has pivoted from neurons to glial cells. This review aims to consider the potential of the optogenetic correction of astrocyte metabolism as a promising strategy for correcting AD-related disorders. The initial segment of the review centers on the role of astrocytes in the genesis of neurodegeneration. Astrocytes have been implicated in several pathological processes associated with AD, encompassing the clearance of β-amyloid, neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism (along with a critical role in apolipoprotein E function). The effect of astrocyte-neuronal interactions will also be scrutinized. Furthermore, the review delves into a number of studies indicating that changes in cellular calcium (Ca\n",
      "Quinoline has been proposed as a privileged molecular framework in medicinal chemistry. Although by itself it has very few applications, its derivatives have diverse biological activities. In this work, 8536 quinoline derivatives, strategically designed using the CADMA-Chem protocol, are presented. This large chemical space was sampled, analyzed and reduced using selection and elimination scores that combine their properties of bioavailability, toxicity and manufacturability. After applying several filters, 25 derivatives were selected to investigate their acid-base, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. The antioxidant activity was predicted based on the ionization potential and bond dissociation energies, parameters directly related to the transfer of hydrogen atoms and of a single electron, respectively. These two mechanisms are typically involved in the radical scavenging processes. The antioxidant efficiency was compared with reference compounds, and the most promising antioxidants were found to be more efficient than Trolox but less efficient than ascorbate. In addition, based on molecular docking simulations, some derivatives are expected to act as inhibitors of catechol-O methyltransferase (COMT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) enzymes. Some structural insights about the compounds were found to enhance or decrease the neuroprotection activity. Based on the results, four quinoline derivatives are proposed as candidates to act as multifunctional antioxidants against Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases.\n",
      "Bioenergetic mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature of several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), where redox imbalance also plays an important role in terms of disease development. AD is an age-related disease and begins many years before the appearance of neurodegenerative symptoms. Intracellular tau aggregation, extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition in the brain, and even the APOE4 genotype contribute to the process of AD by impairing redox homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review summarizes the evidence for the redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD and demonstrates the current therapeutic strategies related to mitochondrial maintenance.\n",
      "In diseases of the central nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and even epilepsy and migraine, oxidative stress load commonly surpasses endogenous antioxidative capacity. While oxidative processes have been robustly implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases, the significance of particular antioxidants, both endogenous and especially exogenous, in maintaining redox homeostasis requires further research. Among endogenous antioxidants, enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase are central to disabling free radicals, thereby preventing oxidative damage to cellular lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Whether supplementation with endogenously occurring antioxidant compounds such as melatonin and glutathione carries any benefit, however, remains equivocal. Similarly, while the health benefits of certain exogenous antioxidants, including ascorbic acid (vitamin C), carotenoids, polyphenols, sulforaphanes, and anthocyanins are commonly touted, their clinical efficacy and effectiveness in particular neurological disease contexts need to be more robustly defined. Here, we review the current literature on the cellular mechanisms mitigating oxidative stress and comment on the possible benefit of the most common exogenous antioxidants in diseases such as AD, PD, ALS, HD, stroke, epilepsy, and migraine. We selected common neurological diseases of a basically neurodegenerative nature.\n",
      "Neurological disorders (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, have been a threat to human health all over the world. It is of great importance to diagnose ND through combining artificial intelligence technology and brain imaging. A graph neural network (GNN) can model and analyze the brain, imaging from morphology, anatomical structure, function features, and other aspects, thus becoming one of the best deep learning models in the diagnosis of ND. Some researchers have investigated the application of GNN in the medical field, but the scope is broad, and its application to NDs is less frequent and not detailed enough. This review focuses on the research progress of GNNs in the diagnosis of ND. Firstly, we systematically investigated the GNN framework of ND, including graph construction, graph convolution, graph pooling, and graph prediction. Secondly, we investigated common NDs using the GNN diagnostic model in terms of data modality, number of subjects, and diagnostic accuracy. Thirdly, we discussed some research challenges and future research directions. The results of this review may be a valuable contribution to the ongoing intersection of artificial intelligence technology and brain imaging.\n",
      "(1) Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that threatens the population health of older adults. However, the mechanisms of the altered metabolism involved in AD pathology are poorly understood. The aim of the study was to identify the potential biomarkers of AD and discover the metabolomic changes produced during the progression of the disease. (2) Methods: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to measure the concentrations of the serum metabolites in a cohort of subjects with AD (n = 88) and a cognitively normal control (CN) group (n = 85). The patients were classified as very mild (n = 25), mild (n = 27), moderate (n = 25), and severe (n = 11). The serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using multivariate and univariate approaches. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to identify the potential biomarkers of AD. Biofunctional enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. (3) Results: Our results revealed considerable separation between the AD and CN groups. Six metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of AD (AUC > 0.85), and the diagnostic model of three metabolites could predict the risk of AD with high accuracy (AUC = 0.984). The metabolic enrichment analysis revealed that carbohydrate metabolism deficiency and the disturbance of amino acid, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism were involved in AD progression. Especially, the pathway analysis highlighted that l-glutamate participated in four crucial nervous system pathways (including the GABAergic synapse, the glutamatergic synapse, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, and the synaptic vesicle cycle). (4) Conclusions: Carbohydrate metabolism deficiency and amino acid dysregulation, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism disorders were pivotal events in AD progression. Our study may provide novel insights into the role of metabolic disorders in AD pathogenesis and identify new markers for AD diagnosis.\n",
      "Junk foods are typically low in essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are also loaded with trans fats and saturated fats, which can increase the level of triglycerides in the blood. High triglyceride levels can contribute to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver. A high intake of junk foods can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin. A diet lacking in nutrients and loaded with unwanted toxins can impair the liver's ability to detoxify harmful substances and damage its overall function. It is known that the regular consumption of junk food can be linked to memory impairment and cognitive decline. Several studies have shown that diets high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and processed foods can negatively impact brain health, including memory function. In this study, Wistar rats were used to model Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD), which was inspired by knowledge of the liver-brain axis's role in causing dementia. The model mimicked junk-food-induced liver-brain damage, and was developed by using the toxins d-galactosamine, ethanol and d-galactose. To begin with, the model rats demonstrated insulin resistance, a characteristic of LOAD patients. Glucose levels in both the brain and liver tissues were significantly elevated in the model, paralleling clinical findings in LOAD patients. High glucose levels in the brain lead to the increased production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which, along with amyloid beta, harm neighbouring neurons. Histopathological analysis revealed deformed glial nodules, apoptotic neurons, and amyloid plaques in the brain section in the later stages of the disease. Simultaneously, the liver section displayed features of cirrhosis, including an effaced lobular architecture and the extravasation of red blood cells. Liver enzymes ALT, AST and ALP were consistently elevated with disease progression. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the diseased brain. The positive expression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 3-Alpha (HIF3A) in the brain indicated hypoxic conditions, which is consistent with other LOAD studies. This model also exhibited damaged intestinal villi and excessive bowel and urinary incontinence, indicating malnutrition and a disturbed gut microbiome, which is also consistent with LOAD patients. Bioinformatics analysis on serum protein suggests a few affected molecular pathways, like the amyloid secretase pathway, androgen/oestrogen/progesterone biosynthesis, the apoptosis signalling pathway, the insulin/IGF pathway-protein kinase B signalling cascade, the Metabotropic glutamate receptor group I pathway, the Wnt signalling pathway, etc. Behavioural analysis confirmed memory decline and the loss of muscle strength with disease progression. Overall, this rat model of LOAD sheds valuable light on LOAD pathology and highlights the potential link between liver dysfunction, particularly induced by the excessive consumption of junk food, and LOAD. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in LOAD, paving the way for new possibilities in therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "Cerebral ischemia, a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide, triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular pathologies linked to several central nervous system (CNS) disorders. These disorders primarily encompass ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, and other CNS conditions. Despite substantial progress in understanding and treating the underlying pathological processes in various neurological diseases, there is still a notable absence of effective therapeutic approaches aimed specifically at mitigating the damage caused by these illnesses. Remarkably, ischemia causes severe damage to cells in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. Cerebral ischemia initiates oxygen and glucose deprivation, which subsequently promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, mitophagy dysfunction, and excessive mitochondrial fission, triggering various forms of cell death such as autophagy, apoptosis, as well as ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, a novel type of regulated cell death (RCD), is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis both play critical roles in the pathogenic progression of ischemia-associated CNS diseases. In recent years, growing evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction interplays with ferroptosis to aggravate cerebral ischemia injury. However, the potential connections between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in cerebral ischemia have not yet been clarified. Thus, we analyzed the underlying mechanism between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. We also discovered that GSH depletion and GPX4 inactivation cause lipoxygenase activation and calcium influx following cerebral ischemia injury, resulting in MPTP opening and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, dysfunction in mitochondrial electron transport and an imbalanced fusion-to-fission ratio can lead to the accumulation of ROS and iron overload, which further contribute to the occurrence of ferroptosis. This creates a vicious cycle that continuously worsens cerebral ischemia injury. In this study, our focus is on exploring the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis, which may offer new insights into potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ischemia-associated CNS diseases.\n",
      "The pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is particularly complicated, and early diagnosis and course monitoring of the disease are not ideal based on the available core biomarkers. As a biomarker closely related to neuroinflammation, YKL-40 provides a potential scalable approach in AD, but its association remains controversial and inconclusive with AD. We conducted this study to assess the utility of YKL-40 levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) by meta-analysis. We systematically searched and screened relevant trials for comparing YKL-40 levels between AD patients and HCs in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a search deadline of 14 March 2023 for each database. A total of 17 eligible and relevant studies involving 1811 subjects, including 949 AD patients and 862 HCs, were included. The results showed that YKL-40 levels in the peripheral blood of AD patients and HCs did not possess significant differences. Subgroup analysis showed YKL-40 significantly differed in plasma (SMD = 0.527, 95%CI: [0.302, 0.752]; \n",
      "This article critically evaluates the multifunctional role of the Golgi apparatus within neurological paradigms. We succinctly highlight its influence on neuronal plasticity, development, and the vital trafficking and sorting mechanisms for proteins and lipids. The discourse further navigates to its regulatory prominence in neurogenesis and its implications in Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis. The emerging nexus between the Golgi apparatus and SARS-CoV-2 underscores its potential in viral replication processes. This consolidation accentuates the Golgi apparatus's centrality in neurobiology and its intersections with both neurodegenerative and viral pathologies. In essence, understanding the Golgi's multifaceted functions harbors profound implications for future therapeutic innovations in neurological and viral afflictions.\n",
      "Insulin resistance (IR) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The mechanisms by which IR predisposes to AD are not well-understood. Epigenetic studies may help identify molecular signatures of IR associated with AD, thus improving our understanding of the biological and regulatory mechanisms linking IR and AD.\n",
      "We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of IR, quantified using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and adjusted for body mass index, in 3,167 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) without type 2 diabetes at the time of blood draw used for methylation measurement. We identified DNA methylation markers associated with IR at the genome-wide level accounting for multiple testing (P < 1.1 × 10\n",

      "Distinctive post-translational modifications (PTM) characterize tau inclusions found in tauopathy patients. Using detergent-insoluble tau isolated from Alzheimer's disease (AD-tau) or Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP-tau) patients, we provide insights into whether phosphorylation of critical residues determine templated tau seeding. Our initial data with phosphorylation-ablating mutations (Ser/Thr → Ala) on select sites of P301L tau showed no changes in seeding efficacy by AD-tau or PSP-tau. Interestingly, when specific sites in the R1-R2 repeat domains (Ser262/Thr263/Ser289/Ser305) were mutated to phosphorylation-mimicking amino acid Glu, it substantially reduced the seeding efficiency of AD-tau, but not PSP-tau seeds. The resultant detergent-insoluble tau shows deficient phosphorylation on AT8, AT100, AT180 and PHF1 epitopes, indicating inter-domain cooperativity. We further identify Ser305 as a critical determinant of AD-tau-specific seeding, whereby the phospho-mimicking Ser305Glu tau abrogates seeding by AD-tau but not PSP-tau. This suggests that phosphorylation on Ser305 could be related to the formation of disease-specific tau strains. Our results highlight the existence of a phospho-PTM code in tau seeding and further demonstrate the distinctive nature of this code in 4R tauopathies.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the main cause for dementia. The irreversible neurodegeneration leads to a gradual loss of brain function characterized predominantly by memory loss. Cerebrovascular changes are common neuropathologic findings in aged subjects with dementia. Cerebrovascular integrity is critical for proper metabolism and perfusion of the brain, as cerebrovascular remodeling may render the brain more susceptible to pulse pressure and may be associated with poorer cognitive performance and greater risk of cerebrovascular events. The objective of this study is to provide understanding of cerebrovascular remodeling with AD progression. Anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) from a total of 19 brain donor participants from controls and pathologically diagnosed AD groups (early-Braak stages I-II; intermediate-Braak stages III-IV; and advanced-Braak stages V-VI) were included in this study. Mechanical testing, histology, advanced optical imaging, and mass spectrometry were performed to study the progressive structural and functional changes of ACAs with AD progression. Biaxial extension-inflation tests showed that ACAs became progressively less compliant, and the longitudinal stress in the intermediate and advanced AD groups was significantly higher than that from the control group. With pathological AD development, the inner and outer diameters of the ACAs remained almost unchanged; however, histology study revealed progressive smooth muscle cell atrophy and loss of elastic fibers which led to compromised structural integrity of the arterial wall. Multiphoton imaging demonstrated elastin degradation at the media-adventitia interface, which led to the formation of an empty band of 21.0 ± 15.4 μm and 32.8 ± 9.24 μm in width for the intermediate and advanced AD groups, respectively. Furthermore, quantitative birefringence microscopy showed disorganized adventitial collagen with AD development. Mass spectrometry analysis provided further evidence of altered collagen content and other extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule and smooth muscle cell changes that were consistent with the mechanical and structural alterations. Collectively, our study provides understanding of the mechanical and structural cerebrovascular deterioration in cerebral arteries with AD, which may be related to neurodegenration and pathology in the brain.\n",
      "Autophagy is vital in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Thus far, no studies have specifically investigated the relationship between pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and autophagy, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study used in vitro and in vivo models, along with clinical samples, to explore interactions between PACAP and autophagy in AD.\n",
      "AD model mice were administered 6 μl of 0.1 mg/ml PACAP liquid intranasally for 4 weeks, then subjected to behavioral analyses to assess the benefits of PACAP treatment. The underlying mechanisms of PACAP-induced effects were investigated by methods including real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Exosomes were extracted from human serum and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to examine autophagy pathways. The clinical and therapeutic implications of PACAP and autophagy were extensively investigated throughout the experiment.\n",
      "Impaired autophagy was a critical step in amyloid β (Aβ) and Tau deposition; PACAP enhanced autophagy and attenuated cognitive impairment. RNA sequencing revealed three pathways that may be involved in AD progression: PI3K-AKT, mTOR, and AMPK. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that sirtuin3 knockdown diminished the ability of PACAP to restore normal autophagy function, resulting in phagocytosis dysregulation and the accumulation of pTau, Tau, and Aβ. Additionally, the autophagic biomarker MAP1LC3 demonstrated a positive association with PACAP in human serum.\n",

It was reported that liensinine and neferine could inhibit the activities of acetylcholinesterase and cross the blood-brain barriers, suggesting their therapeutic potential for the management of Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "Here, we employed SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with the human Swedish amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation APP695 (APP695swe SH-SY5Y) as an in vitro model and transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo model to investigate the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanism of liensinine and neferine.\n",
      "We found that liensinine and neferine could significantly improve the viability and reduce ROS levels in APP695swe SH-SY5Y cells, inhibit β-amyloid and tau-induced toxicity, and enhance stress resistance in nematodes. Moreover, liensinine and neferine had obviously neuroprotective effects by assaying chemotaxis, 5-hydroxytryptamine sensitivity and the integrity of injured neurons in nematodes. Preliminary mechanism studies revealed that liensinine and neferine could upregulate the expression of autophagy related genes (lgg-1, unc-51, pha-4, atg-9 and ced-9) and reduce the accumulation of β-amyloid induced autophagosomes, which suggested autophagy pathway played a key role in neuroprotective effects of these two alkaloids.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). It affects cognition and leads to memory impairment. The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) plays an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and has been implicated in several neuronal disorders or neuronal injuries. Ligands targeting the mitochondrial translocator protein (18 kDa), promote neurosteroidogenesis and may be neuroprotective. To study whether the TSPO ligand XBD173 may exert early neuroprotective effects in AD pathology we investigated the impact of XBD173 on amyloid toxicity and neuroplasticity in mouse models of AD. We show that XBD173 (emapunil), via neurosteroid-mediated signaling and delta subunit-containing GABA\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease begins with mild memory loss and slowly destroys memory and thinking. Cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease has been associated with the localization of the microtubule-associated protein Tau at the postsynapse. However, the correlation between Tau at the postsynapse and synaptic dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we show that Tau arrests liquid-like droplets formed by the four postsynaptic density proteins PSD-95, GKAP, Shank, Homer in solution, as well as NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor-associated protein clusters on synthetic membranes. Tau-mediated condensate/cluster arrest critically depends on the binding of multiple interaction motifs of Tau to a canonical GMP-binding pocket in the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95. We further reveal that competitive binding of a high-affinity phosphorylated peptide to PSD-95 rescues the diffusional dynamics of an NMDA truncated construct, which contains the last five amino acids of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B fused to the C-terminus of the tetrameric GCN4 coiled-coil domain, in postsynaptic density-like condensates/clusters. Taken together, our findings propose a molecular mechanism where Tau modulates the dynamic properties of the postsynaptic density.\n",

      "Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a frequently observed underlying pathology of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), which is a common consequence of cerebral blood flow (CBF) dysregulation. Synaptic damage has been proven as a crucial causative factor for CCH-related cognitive impairment. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective impact of environmental enrichment (EE) intervention on CCH-induced synaptic destruction and the consequent cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of this neuroprotective effect was explored to provide new insights into therapeutic interventions for individuals suffering from AD or VD.\n",
      "In this experiment, all rats were initially acclimatized to a standard environment (SE) for a period of one week. On the seventh day, rats underwent either bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) surgery or sham surgery (Sham) before being subjected to a four-week procedure of exposure to an EE, except for the control group. During the EE or SE procedure, intraperitoneal injection of chloroquine (CQ) into rats was performed once daily for four weeks. Following this, cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The synapse ultrastructure was subsequently observed using transmission electron microscopy. Expression levels of autophagy-related proteins (LC3, LAMP1, and P62) and synapse-related proteins (Synapsin I and PSD-95) were detected through Western blotting. Finally, immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression levels of Synapsin I and PSD-95 and the colocalization of LAMP-1 and LC3 in the hippocampus.\n",
      "After undergoing 2VO, rats exposed to SE exhibited cognitive impairment, autophagic dysfunction, and synapse damage. The synapse damage was evidenced by ultrastructural damage and degradation of synapse-related proteins. However, these effects were significantly mitigated by exposure to an EE intervention. Moreover, the intervention led to an improvement in autophagic dysfunction.\n",
      "The study found that EE had a positive impact on CCH-induced synaptic damage. Specifically, EE was found to increase synaptic plasticity-associated proteins and postsynaptic density thickness, while decreasing synaptic space. This multifaceted effect resulted in an amelioration of CCH-induced cognitive impairment. It was shown that this beneficial outcome was mediated via the activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Overall, the findings suggest that EE may have a therapeutic potential for cognitive impairments associated with CCH through autophagy-mediated synaptic improvement.\n",
      "The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise due to the increasing aging population. Among the various genetic factors associated with AD, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid transporter, stands out as the primary genetic risk factor. Specifically, individuals carrying the ApoE4 allele exhibit a significantly higher risk. However, emerging research indicates that dietary factors play a prominent role in modifying the risk of AD. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a prominent ω-3 fatty acid, has garnered considerable attention for its potential to ameliorate cognitive function. The intricate interplay between DHA and the ApoE genotype within the brain, which may influence DHA's utilization and functionality, warrants further investigation. This review meticulously examines experimental and clinical studies exploring the effects of DHA on cognitive decline. Special emphasis is placed on elucidating the role of ApoE gene polymorphism and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. These studies suggest that early DHA supplementation may confer benefits to cognitively normal older adults carrying the ApoE4 gene. However, once AD develops, ApoE4 non-carriers may experience greater benefits compared to ApoE4 carriers, although the overall effectiveness of DHA supplementation at this stage is limited. Potential mechanisms underlying these differential effects may include accelerated DHA catabolism in ApoE4 carriers, impaired transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and compromised lipidation and circulatory function in ApoE4 carriers. Thus, the supplementation of DHA may represent a potential intervention strategy aimed at compensating for these deficiencies in ApoE4 carriers prior to the onset of AD.\n",
      "Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by triplication of human chromosome 21. In addition to intellectual disability, DS is defined by a premature aging phenotype and Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, including septohippocampal circuit vulnerability and degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). The Ts65Dn mouse model recapitulates key aspects of DS/AD pathology, namely age-associated atrophy of BFCNs and cognitive decline in septohippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks. We investigated whether maternal choline supplementation (MCS), a well-tolerated treatment modality, protects vulnerable BFCNs from age- and genotype-associated degeneration in trisomic offspring. We also examined the effect of trisomy, and MCS, on GABAergic basal forebrain parvalbumin neurons (BFPNs), an unexplored neuronal population in this DS model. Unbiased stereological analyses of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive BFCNs and parvalbumin-immunoreactive BFPNs were conducted using confocal z-stacks of the medial septal nucleus and the vertical limb of the diagonal band (MSN/VDB) in Ts65Dn mice and disomic (2N) littermates at 3-4 and 10-12 months of age. MCS trisomic offspring displayed significant increases in ChAT-immunoreactive neuron number and density compared to unsupplemented counterparts, as well as increases in the area of the MSN/VDB occupied by ChAT-immunoreactive neuropil. MCS also rescued BFPN number and density in Ts65Dn offspring, a novel rescue of a non-cholinergic cell population. Furthermore, MCS prevented age-associated loss of BFCNs and MSN/VDB regional area in 2N offspring, indicating genotype-independent neuroprotective benefits. These findings demonstrate MCS provides neuroprotection of vulnerable BFCNs and non-cholinergic septohippocampal BFPNs, indicating this modality has translational value as an early life therapy for DS, as well as extending benefits to the aging population at large.\n",

Variables included age, sex, vital signs, laboratory values, employment status and social covariates pertaining to marital, tobacco and alcohol status. Random sampling was performed to create a training (70%) set for hyperparameter tuning in internal 5-fold cross validation and an external hold-out testing (30%) set of patients, both stratified by age.

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly associated with self-aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) proteins into fibrils. Inhibition of Aβ aggregation by polyphenols is one of the major therapeutic strategies for AD. Among them, four polyphenols (brazilin, resveratrol, hematoxylin, and rosmarinic acid) have been reported to be effective at inhibiting Aβ aggregation, but the inhibition mechanisms are still unclear. In this work, these four polyphenols were selected to explore their interactions with the Aβ17-42 pentamer by molecular dynamics simulation. All four polyphenols can bind to the pentamer tightly but prefer different binding sites. Conversion of the β-sheet to the random coil, fewer interchain hydrogen bonds, and weaker salt bridges were observed after binding. Interestingly, different Aβ17-42 pentamer destabilizing mechanisms for resveratrol and hematoxylin were found. Resveratrol inserts into the hydrophobic core of the pentamer by forming hydrogen bonds with Asp23 and Lys28, while hematoxylin prefers to bind beside chain A of the pentamer, which leads to β-sheet offset and dissociation of the β1 sheet of chain E. This work reveals the interactions between the Aβ17-42 pentamer and four polyphenols and discusses the relationship between inhibitor structures and their inhibition mechanisms, which also provides useful guidance for screening effective Aβ aggregation inhibitors and drug design against AD.\n",

      "α-Synuclein (aSyn) aggregation underlies neurodegenerative synucleinopathies. aSyn seeds are proposed to replicate and propagate neuronal pathology like prions. Seeding of aSyn can be recapitulated in cellular systems of aSyn aggregation; however, the mechanism of aSyn seeding and its regulation are not well understood. We developed an mEos-based aSyn seeding assay and performed saturation mutagenesis to identify with single-residue resolution positive and negative regulators of aSyn aggregation. We not only found the core regions that govern aSyn aggregation but also identified mutants outside of the core that enhance aggregation. We identified local structure within the N terminus of aSyn that hinders the fibrillization propensity of its aggregation-prone core. Based on the screen, we designed a minimal aSyn fragment that shows a ~4-fold enhancement in seeding activity and enabled discrimination of synucleinopathies. Our study expands the basic knowledge of aSyn aggregation and advances the design of cellular systems of aSyn aggregation to diagnose synucleinopathies based on protein conformation.\n",

Niemann-Pick type A (NPA) is a fatal neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease characterized by abnormal sphingomyelin accumulation in the endolysosomal lumen. The ability to monitor abnormalities in lipid homeostasis intracranially could improve basic investigations and the development of effective treatment strategies. We investigated the carbon nanotube-based detection of intracranial lipid content. We found that the near-infrared emission of a carbon nanotube-based lipid sensor responds to lipid accumulation in neuronal and in vivo models of NPA.

      "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes cognitive impairment and contributes to the overall global burden of dementia. However, mechanisms through which the kidneys and brain communicate are not fully understood. We established a CKD mouse model through adenine-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Novel object recognition tests indicated that CKD decreased recognition memory. Sarkosyl-insoluble-proteomic analyses of the CKD mouse hippocampus revealed an accumulation of insoluble MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) and RNA-binding proteins such as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1 subunit 70 (SNRNP70). Additionally, there was an accumulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. We identified that expressions of essential tight-junction protein claudin-5 and adherens-junction protein platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) were decreased in the brain endothelial cells of CKD mice. We determined urea as a major uremic solute that dose dependently decreased both claudin-5 and PECAM-1 expression in the mouse brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 cells. Gelatin zymography indicated that the serum of CKD mice activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), while marimastat ameliorated the reduction of claudin-5 expression by urea in bEnd.3 cells. This study established a brain proteomic signature of CKD indicating BBB breakdown and insolubility of tau protein, which are pathologically linked to Alzheimer's disease. Urea-mediated activation of MMP2 was partly responsible for BBB breakdown in CKD.\n",

However, no study has investigated CT in the prison setting. Thus, this one-arm feasibility trial aims to analyze the feasibility of (i) the study protocol and (ii) the implementation of multimodal CT for older prisoners. Eighteen older male prisoners from two specific divisions for older prisoner participated in 12 weekly CT sessions using the NEUROvitalis program. The feasibility analysis included recruitment, dropout, and CT participation rates, and motivation for and satisfaction with CT (using 6-point Likert-scales). The study protocol demonstrated sufficient feasibility with high recruitment rates between 46 and 50%. Therefore, the CT implementation was successful: Only one prisoner ceased participation; all others completed the CT sessions (i.e., attended > 75% of the sessions). Prisoners reported high CT motivation and satisfaction, and would recommend CT. This is the first study to demonstrate CT feasibility in older prisoners. Although more research is needed, these results are a starting point for expanding services to include cognitively enhancing activities for older prisoners.This one-arm feasibility study was pre-registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS; ID: DRKS00020227).), Registered 11 Mai 2021 https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00020227 .\n",

Personalized management requires investigation of amyloid pathology and the risk factors for both amyloid pathology and cognitive decline in the Chinese population. We aimed to investigate amyloid positivity and deposition in AD patients, as well as factors related to amyloid pathology in Chinese cities.\n",
      "This cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in Shanghai and Zhengzhou, China. All participants were recruited from urban communities and memory clinics. Amyloid positivity and deposition were analyzed based on amyloid positron emission tomography (PET).

The overall amyloid-positive rates in individuals with clinically diagnosed AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal cognition (NC) were 85.8%, 44.5%, and 26.9%, respectively. The global amyloid deposition standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) (reference: cerebellar crus) were 1.44 ± 0.24, 1.30 ± 0.22, and 1.24 ± 0.14, respectively.

For quantitative analyses, random effects models, subgroup analyses, and dose-response analyses are performed. A total of 37 studies are included in the systematic review. Among (poly)phenols, a higher intake of flavonoids is associated with better cognitive function and lower odds of cognitive decline (although with some exceptions).

      "Multimodal neuroimaging has gained traction in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis by integrating information from multiple imaging modalities to enhance classification accuracy. However, effectively handling heterogeneous data sources and overcoming the challenges posed by multiscale transform methods remains a significant hurdle. This article proposes a novel approach to address these challenges. To harness the power of diverse neuroimaging data, we employ a strategy that leverages optimized convolution techniques. These optimizations include varying kernel sizes and the incorporation of instance normalization, both of which play crucial roles in feature extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Specifically, varying kernel sizes allow us to adapt the receptive field to different image characteristics, enhancing the model's ability to capture relevant information. Furthermore, we employ transposed convolution, which increases spatial resolution of feature maps, and it is optimized with varying kernel sizes and instance normalization. This heightened resolution facilitates the alignment and integration of data from disparate MRI and PET data. The use of larger kernels and strides in transposed convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to capture essential cross-modal relationships. Instance normalization, applied to each modality during the fusion process, mitigates potential biases stemming from differences in intensity, contrast, or scale between modalities. This enhancement contributes to improved model performance by reducing complexity and ensuring robust fusion. The performance of the proposed fusion method is assessed on three distinct neuroimaging datasets, which include: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD, and Early Mild Cognitive); Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, Mild Dementia, Very Mild Dementia); and whole-brain atlas neuroimaging (AANLIB) (consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD). To evaluate the quality of the fused images generated via our method, we employ a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM), which assesses the structural similarity between two images; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which measures how closely the generated image resembles the ground truth; Entropy (E), which assesses the amount of information preserved or lost during fusion; the Feature Similarity Indexing Method (FSIM), which assesses the structural and feature similarities between two images; and Edge-Based Similarity (EBS), which measures the similarity of edges between the fused and ground truth images. The obtained fused image is further evaluated using a Mobile Vision Transformer. In the classification of AD vs. Cognitive Normal, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.00%, specificity of 99.00%, and sensitivity of 98.44% on the AANLIB dataset.\n",
      "The prevalence of dementia among the elderly is high, and it is the leading cause of death globally. However, the relationship between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk has produced inconsistent results, necessitating an updated review of the evidence. To address this, we conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize the available evidence on the association between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk and evaluate its credibility. We systematically evaluated the meta-analyses of observational studies that examined the connection between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk. For each meta-analysis, we collected the overall effect size, heterogeneity, risk of bias, and year of the most recent article and graded the evidence based on pre-specified criteria. We also used AMSTAR, a measurement tool to evaluate systematic reviews, to assess the methodological quality of each study. Our review included five meta-analyses encompassing 30 studies, and the effect size of the association between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk ranged from 1.38 to 1.78. Nonetheless, the evidence supporting this relationship was weak, and the methodological quality of the studies included was low. In conclusion, our findings revealed limited evidence of a link between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk, and more research is required to determine a causal connection. Physicians should only prescribe benzodiazepine for appropriate indications.\n",
      "The present study aims to explore the differences in the manifestation of cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms across the different ages of MCI onset: early onset (EOMCI: <65 years old), middle onset (MOMCI: 65-75 years old), and late onset (LOMCI: >75 years old). It was hypothesized that individuals with EOMCI will preserve their cognitive functions to a greater extent as compared to individuals with LOMCI, even after adjusting the cognitive performance for age and education through the use of published Greek norms. The level of cognitive decline concerning MOMCI was evaluated for extracting more precise conclusions regarding the impact of the age of onset on the patterns of MCI symptomatology. The analyses of data were conducted in a Greek population of individuals with MCI, who were consecutive visitors of the Outpatient Memory Clinic of Nestor Alzheimer's Centre in Athens, Greece. The sample consisted of 297 participants who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: MCI diagnosis based on Petersen's criteria, Greek mother language, and absence of a psychiatric history or chronic and incurable organic disease. The overall results support the presence of a cognitive advantage of the EOMCI group compared to the LOMCI group. In the MOMCI group, cognitive performance displayed a tendency to remain intermediate compared to the other two groups. Nonetheless, significant differences were observed when this group was compared with the LOMCI group. The current findings indicate that the age of onset should be taken under consideration in the neuropsychological assessment of individuals with MCI. The specific parameters could have implications in terms of prognosis as well as the design and implementation of tailored interventions.\n",

      "The current study examines the relationship between the cognitive state of participants [healthy-early mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-late MCI], some subjective wellbeing factors (positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning in life, accomplishment, and negative emotions), and negative psychological outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress), as well as psychological resilience. We expected that people with advanced MCI would perceive increased negative psychological outcomes, poorer psychological resilience, and lower levels of subjective wellbeing in contrast to early MCI and healthy participants. The study involved 30 healthy, 31 early, and 28 late MCI individuals. A series of questionnaires have been applied to assess the aforementioned constructs. To examine the hypotheses of the study, path analysis (EQS program) was applied. Results showed that early MCI persons maintain the same levels of positive emotions and feelings of accomplishment with healthy peers. Late-stage patients present those feelings in a diminished form, which adversely impacts psychological resilience. Individuals with early and late MCI exhibit negative emotions and stress that impact their resilience; however, those with early MCI experience greater stress, negative emotions, depression, and anxiety. These findings may be utilized to design psychological interventions for resilience enhancement and support brain health in elderly adults who are at risk of neurodegeneration.\n",
      "A form of dementia distinct from healthy cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multi-stage disease that currently afflicts over 50 million people worldwide. Unfortunately, previous therapeutic strategies developed from murine models emulating different aspects of AD pathogenesis were limited. Consequently, researchers are now developing models that express several aspects of pathogenesis that better reflect the clinical situation in humans. As such, this review seeks to provide insight regarding current applications of mammalian models in AD research by addressing recent developments and characterizations of prominent transgenic models and their contributions to pathogenesis as well as discuss the advantages, limitations, and application of emerging models that better capture genetic heterogeneity and mixed pathologies observed in the clinical situation.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD)-the most common cause of dementia in the elderly-is characterized by progressive memory loss and β-amyloid protein (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. Recently, loneliness was found to be a high risk factor for AD, and social isolation has become a major cause of AD. AD. Oxytocin (OXT), the main hormone involved in social bonding, has been implicated in social interactions, notably in building trust and relationships. Moreover, social isolation or social enrichment modulates the activation of neurons related to OXT. Recently, we reported that OXT reverses learning and memory impairment in AD animal models. Based on the limited number of studies currently available, OXT might be a therapeutic target for AD. Further studies are necessary in order to better understand the role of oxytocin in AD. In this review, we described the relationships between OXT, AD, and social interaction.\n",
      "The main human hereditary peripheral neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth, CMT), manifests in progressive sensory and motor deficits. Mutations in the compact myelin protein gene pmp22 cause more than 50% of all CMTs. CMT1E is a subtype of CMT1 myelinopathy carrying micro-mutations in pmp22. The Trembler-J mice have a spontaneous mutation in pmp22 identical to that present in CMT1E human patients. PMP22 is mainly (but not exclusively) expressed in Schwann cells. Some studies have found the presence of pmp22 together with some anomalies in the CNS of CMT patients. Recently, we identified the presence of higher hippocampal pmp22 expression and elevated levels of anxious behavior in TrJ/+ compared to those observed in wt. In the present paper, we delve deeper into the central expression of the neuropathy modeled in Trembler-J analyzing in vivo the cerebrovascular component by Ultrafast Doppler, exploring the vascular structure by scanning laser confocal microscopy, and analyzing the behavioral profile by anxiety and motor difficulty tests. We have found that TrJ/+ hippocampi have increased blood flow and a higher vessel volume compared with the wild type. Together with this, we found an anxiety-like profile in TrJ/+ and the motor difficulties described earlier. We demonstrate that there are specific cerebrovascular hemodynamics associated with a vascular structure and anxious behavior associated with the TrJ/+ clinical phenotype, a model of the human CMT1E disease.\n",
      "The field of neuroscience is rapidly progressing, continuously uncovering new insights and discoveries. Among the areas that have shown immense potential in research, tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) have emerged as a promising subject of study. These minute structures act as conduits for the transfer of cellular materials between cells, representing a mechanism of communication that holds great significance. In particular, the interplay facilitated by TNTs among various cell types within the brain, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, glial cells, and microglia, can be essential for the normal development and optimal functioning of this complex organ. The involvement of TNTs in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease, has attracted significant attention. These disorders are characterized by the progressive degeneration of neurons and the subsequent decline in brain function. Studies have predicted that TNTs likely play critical roles in the propagation and spread of pathological factors, contributing to the advancement of these diseases. Thus, there is a growing interest in understanding the precise functions and mechanisms of TNTs within the nervous system. This review article, based on our recent work on Rhes-mediated TNTs, aims to explore the functions of TNTs within the brain and investigate their implications for neurodegenerative diseases. Using the knowledge gained from studying TNTs could offer novel opportunities for designing targeted treatments that can stop the progression of neurodegenerative disorders.\n",
      "Telomeres are structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that help maintain genomic stability. During aging, telomere length gradually shortens, producing short telomeres, which are markers of premature cellular senescence. This may contribute to age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and based on this, several studies have hypothesized that telomere shortening may characterize AD. Current research, however, has been inconclusive regarding the direction of the association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and disease risk. We assessed the association between LTL and AD in a retrospective case-control study of a sample of 255 unrelated patients with late-onset AD (LOAD), including 120 sporadic cases and 135 with positive family history for LOAD, and a group of 279 cognitively healthy unrelated controls, who were all from Calabria, a southern Italian region.

      "DUSP4 is a member of the DUSP (Dual-Specificity Phosphatase) subfamily that is selective to the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and has been implicated in a range of biological processes and functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we utilized stereotactic delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-DUSP4 to overexpress DUSP4 in the dorsal hippocampus of 5xFAD and wildtype (WT) mice, then used mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics along with label-free quantification to profile the proteome and phosphoproteome in the hippocampus. We identified patterns of protein expression and phosphorylation that are modulated in 5xFAD mice and examined the sex-specific impact of DUSP4 overexpression on the 5xFAD proteome/phosphoproteome. In 5xFAD mice, a substantial number of proteins were up- or down-regulated in both male and female mice in comparison to age and sex-matched WT mice, many of which are involved in AD-related biological processes, such as the activated immune response or suppression of synaptic activities. Upon DUSP4 overexpression, significantly regulated proteins were found in pathways that were suppressed, such as the immune response, in male 5xFAD mice. In contrast, such a shift was absent in female mice. For the phosphoproteome, we detected an array of phosphorylation sites that are regulated in 5xFAD compared to WT, and are modulated by DUSP4 overexpression in each sex. Interestingly, the changes in 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation occurred in opposite directions. Strikingly, both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation changes were found for the most part in neurons, and play key roles in neuronal processes and synaptic function. Site-centric pathway analysis revealed that both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation sites were enriched for a number of kinase sets in female, but only a limited number of sets of kinases in male mice. Taken together, our results suggest that male and female 5xFAD mice respond to DUSP4 overexpression via shared and sex-specific molecular mechanisms, which might underly similar reductions in amyloid pathology in both sexes, while learning deficits were reduced in only females with DUSP4 overexpression. Finally, we validated our findings with the sex-specific AD-associated proteomes in human cohorts and further developed DUSP4-centric proteomic network models and signaling maps for each sex.\n",

      "As genetic testing has become more accessible and affordable, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are increasingly identified, and determining whether these variants play causal roles in disease is a major challenge. The known disease-associated Annexin A11 (ANXA11) mutations result in ANXA11 aggregation, alterations in lysosomal-RNA granule co-trafficking, and TDP-43 mis-localization and present as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia. We identified a novel VUS in ANXA11 (P93S) in a kindred with corticobasal syndrome and unique radiographic features that segregated with disease. We then queried neurodegenerative disorder clinic databases to identify the phenotypic spread of ANXA11 mutations. Multi-modal computational analysis of this variant was performed and the effect of this VUS on ANXA11 function and TDP-43 biology was characterized in iPSC-derived neurons. Single-cell sequencing and proteomic analysis of iPSC-derived neurons and microglia were used to determine the multiomic signature of this VUS. Mutations in ANXA11 were found in association with clinically diagnosed corticobasal syndrome, thereby establishing corticobasal syndrome as part of ANXA11 clinical spectrum. In iPSC-derived neurons expressing mutant ANXA11, we found decreased colocalization of lysosomes and decreased neuritic RNA as well as decreased nuclear TDP-43 and increased formation of cryptic exons compared to controls. Multiomic assessment of the P93S variant in iPSC-derived neurons and microglia indicates that the pathogenic omic signature in neurons is modest compared to microglia. Additionally, omic studies reveal that immune dysregulation and interferon signaling pathways in microglia are central to disease. Collectively, these findings identify a new pathogenic variant in ANXA11, expand the range of clinical syndromes caused by ANXA11 mutations, and implicate both neuronal and microglia dysfunction in ANXA11 pathophysiology. This work illustrates the potential for iPSC-derived cellular models to revolutionize the variant annotation process and provides a generalizable approach to determining causality of novel variants across genes.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits spatially heterogeneous 3R/4R tau pathology distributions across participants, making it a challenge to quantify extent of tau deposition. Utilizing Tau-PET from three independent cohorts, we trained and validated a machine learning model to identify visually positive Tau-PET scans from regional SUVR values and developed a novel summary measure, THETA, that accounts for heterogeneity in tau deposition. The model for identification of tau positivity achieved a balanced test accuracy of 95% and accuracy of ≥87% on the validation datasets. THETA captured heterogeneity of tau deposition, had better association with clinical measures, and corresponded better with visual assessments in comparison with the temporal meta-region-of-interest Tau-PET quantification methods. Our novel approach aids in identification of positive Tau-PET scans and provides a quantitative summary measure, THETA, that effectively captures the heterogeneous tau deposition seen in AD.

AD has a significant influence on cognitive functions, particularly memory, resulting in a variety of functional deficits. Given the increasing prevalence of AD, there is an urgent need for the development of effective therapeutic therapies. In a quest to uncover a holistic remedy for AD, a total of 41 bioactive compounds derived from three distinct medicinal plant sources were screened to evaluate their potential to inhibit the active sites of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The insilico screening protocol included 24 licorice-derived compounds, 5 ginkgo biloba-derived compounds, and 11 ginseng-derived compounds. Two compounds (Ginkgolide A and Licorice glycoside D2) were observed to display greater binding energy (BE) relative to the control by interacting with crucial residues in the active site of AChE. Ginkgolide A and Licorice glycoside D2 exhibited BEs of -11.3 and -11.2 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas the control, Donepezil, demonstrated a BE of -10.8 kcal/mol.

      "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer is implicated as a possible cause of cognitive impairment (CI). CI in dementia and Alzheimer's disease is associated with neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigated a potential role of neuroinflammation in ADT-related CI.\n",
      "Patients with prostate cancer on ADT for ≥3 months were categorized as having ADT-emergent CI or normal cognition (NC) based on self-report at interview. Neuroinflammation was evaluated using positron emission tomography (PET) with the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [\n",
      "Eleven patients underwent PET: four with reported CI (rCI), six with reported NC (rNC), and one status unrecorded. PET did not reveal any between-group differences in SUVR regionally or globally. There was no difference between groups on brain activation to the CRT. Regardless of the reported cognitive status, there was strong correlation between PET-TSPO signal and CRT activation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial cortex.\n",
      "We found no difference in neuroinflammation measured by PET-TSPO between patients with rCI and rNC. However, we speculate that the strong correlation between TSPO uptake and BOLD-fMRI activation in brain regions involved in memory and known to have high androgen-receptor expression mediating plasticity (hippocampus and amygdala) might reflect inflammatory effects of ADT with compensatory upregulated/increased synaptic functions. Further studies of this imaging readout are warranted to investigate ADT-related CI.\n",

      "Spinal biomechanical alignment is now able to be altered through the use of unique sound wave technology. This methodological commentary will correlate recent studies demonstrating the ability of sound waves to carry mass, how the EPIC technique spinal procedure uses a sound wave impulse to create measurable changes in spinal alignment, and the clinical safety and efficacy of this approach. The EPIC technique is a direct genealogical descendant of the technique originally developed by the founding family of chiropractic. With sound wave therapies currently being used to break up kidney stones, called lithotripsy, in physical therapy for the treatment of soft tissue injuries, in the treatment of prostate cancer, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, it is possible that the use of sound wave therapies may enter into the realm of altering joint biomechanics. Through a neurovascular examination, the EPIC technique spinal procedure can ascertain the presence of craniocervical subluxation, followed by acquiring multi-dimensional radiographic images for structural analysis. Currently using digital radiographic analysis, the EPIC technique acquires an epigenetic profile of structural asymmetries as well as a multi-directional biomechanical malposition profile of the spine, combining both profiles to ascertain the exact degrees for realignment. EPIC clinics have successfully utilized EPIC on over 20,000 cases. Comparison of pre-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra around the Z-axis measured on digital radiographs, and post-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra measured on digital radiographs immediately following the procedure, demonstrated an average 52% reduction in lateral biomechanical displacement around the Z-axis in a select group of over 2,000 cases. While more research is required, we are encouraged by these preliminary results. WC 265.\n",
      "Brain fuel (specifically, glucose) supply and metabolism are well-established to be limiting factors for cognitive performance, with the largest body of data being for hippocampally mediated tasks. Consistent with this, disease states such as Alzheimer's disease and insulin-resistant diabetes, that impair cognitive metabolism, impair cognition with this being shown again most prominently for hippocampally mediated processes. In addition to glucose supplied from the blood, brain oxidative metabolism can use local glycogen stores (within astrocytes) as a fuel source via conversion to lactate; both lactate and glycogen have been shown to be important contributors to regulation of cognitive metabolism. Insulin has been shown to be a key regulator of hippocampal cognitive and metabolic processes; in the periphery, insulin facilitates glycogen synthesis and storage, but the impact on brain glycogen is unclear. Furthermore, the impact of diet-induced diabetes on hippocampal glycogen levels and/or metabolism is unknown. Here, we show that in rats with high-fat diet-induced diabetes, hippocampal glycogen is reduced and is less responsive to acute intrahippocampal administration of insulin, which significantly reduces glycogen in the hippocampi of control animals: Our data suggest that impaired fuel availability from glycogen may be a contributing factor to the cognitive impairment seen in disease states that include central insulin resistance.\n",
      "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. Current cellular models for AD often require several months to exhibit phenotypic features due to the lack of an aging environment in vitro. Lamin A is a key component of the nuclear lamina. Progerin, a truncated protein resulting from specific lamin A mutations, causes Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a disease that prematurely ages individuals. Studies have reported that lamin A expression is induced in the brains of AD patients, and overlapping cellular phenotypes have been observed between HGPS and AD cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of exogenous progerin expression on neural progenitor cells carrying familial AD mutations (FAD). Within three to four weeks of differentiation, these cells exhibited robust AD phenotypes, including increased tau phosphorylation, amyloid plaque accumulation, and an elevated Aβ42 to Aβ40 ratio. Additionally, progerin expression significantly increased AD cellular phenotypes such as cell death and cell cycle re-entry. Our results suggest that progerin expression could be used to create an accelerated model for AD development and drug screening.\n",

The origin of synaptic Aβ aggregates remains elusive, but loss of endosomal proteostasis may trigger their formation.In this study we identified the synaptic compartments where Aβ accumulates and performed a longitudinal analysis of synaptosomes isolated from brains of TgCRND8 APP transgenic mice of either sex. To evaluate the specific contribution of Aβ-degrading protease endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1) to synaptic/endosomal Aβ homeostasis, we analyzed the effect of partial \n",
      "We have developed a zebrafish model to explore the alterations in neurobehaviors resulting from both acute and chronic exposure to chromium (Cr). Zebrafish exposed to half (HC group: 19.7 mg/L) and a quarter (LC group: 9.85 mg/L) of the LD50 concentration of Cr for a span of 2 weeks exhibited aberrant locomotion, heightened anxiety, cognitive impairment, and reduced aggression - hallmark traits reminiscent of an Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-like syndrome. Furthermore, zebrafish exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of Cr (EC group: 100 μg/L) for an extended period of 9 weeks exhibited behaviors comparable to those observed in the HC group. Moreover, the study investigated the neuroprotective effects of donepezil (Don), galantamine (Gal) and resveratrol (Res) drugs in response to neurobehavioral impairments induced by Cr (VI) exposure in zebrafish. Don and Res effectively protect the zebrafish from Cr (VI)-induced anxiety, and memory impairment. Furthermore, Cr (VI) exposure induced heightened oxidative stress while simultaneously diminishing antioxidant enzyme levels. Remarkably, these effects were counteracted in the drug-treated groups. Likewise, exposure to Cr (VI) led to an increase in the expression of genes linked to AD and neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, drug treatment reversed this effect in Cr (VI)-exposed fish. The results of our study highlight the potentials of zebrafish model in demonstrating neurobehavioral impairments induced by Cr (VI), thereby paving the way for its utilization in vivo neurobehaviors investigations and pharmaceutical screening.\n",
      "Abnormal activation of microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) and its phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and MARK4 inhibition can be a strategy to develop disease-modifying therapy. Here we report the development of a membrane-permeable peptide that inhibits MARK4 activity in an allosteric manner. The SARS-CoV-2-derived protein Orf9b inhibited MARK4-mediated tau phosphorylation in primary neurons and Drosophila. Orf9b inhibited MARK4 activity in an allosteric manner and did not inhibit the activity of MARK2, which is another MARK family member and is closely related to MARK4. Co-expression of Orf9b in the fly retina expressing human tau and MARK4 suppressed phosphorylation of tau at the microtubule-binding repeats and tau-induced neurodegeneration. We identified the minimal sequence of Orf9b required to suppress MARK4 activity and fused it to a cell-permeable sequence (TAT-Orf9b\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis has been attributed to extracellular aggregates of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the human brain. It has been reported that butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) also accumulates in the brain Aβ plaques in AD. We have previously found that the BChE substitution in 5'UTR caused an in-frame N-terminal extension of 41 amino acids of the BChE signal peptide. The resultant variant with a 69 amino acid signal peptide, designated N-BChE, could play a role in AD development. Here, we report that the signal sequence of the BChE, if produced in an extended 69 aa version, can self-aggregate and could form seeds that enhance amyloid fibril formation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and create larger co-aggregates. Similar phenomena could have been observed in the human brain if such an extended form of the signal sequence had been, in some circumstances, translated.\n",
      "Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation is a modern neuromodulation technique that integrates traditional Chinese acupuncture therapy with contemporary electrical stimulation. It involves the application of electrical currents to specific acupoints on the body following acupuncture. EA has been widely used in the treatment of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Recent research suggests that EA stimulation may modulate neural oscillations, correcting abnormal brain electrical activity, promoting brain function, and aiding in neurological rehabilitation. This paper conducted a comprehensive search in databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI using keywords like \"electroacupuncture,\" \"neural oscillations,\" and \"neurorehabilitation\", covering the period from year 1980 to 2023. We provide a detailed overview of how electroacupuncture stimulation modulates neural oscillations, including maintaining neural activity homeostasis, influencing neurotransmitter release, improving cerebral hemodynamics, and enhancing specific neural functional networks. The paper also discusses the current state of research, limitations of electroacupuncture-induced neural oscillation techniques, and explores prospects for their combined application, aiming to offer broader insights for both basic and clinical research.\n",
      "GV1001 protects neural cells from amyloid-β (Aβ) toxicity and other stressors in in vitro studies and demonstrates clinically beneficial effects in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the protective effects and mechanism of action of GV1001 in triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice. We found that GV1001 improved memory and cognition in middle- and old-aged 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally, it reduced Aβ oligomer and phospho-tau (Ser202 and Thr205) levels in the brain, and mitigated neuroinflammation by promoting a neuroprotective microglial and astrocyte phenotype while diminishing the neurotoxic ones. In vitro, GV1001 bound to gonadotropin releasing hormone receptors (GnRHRs) with high affinity. Levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a direct downstream effector of activated GnRHRs, increased after GV1001 treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of GnRHRs blocked GV1001-induced effects. Thus, GV1001 might improve cognitive and memory functions of 3xTg-AD mice by suppressing neuroinflammation and reducing Aβ oligomers levels and phospho-tau by activating GnRHRs and their downstream signaling pathways.\n",
      "Accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from the brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a crucial task in the neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus structures is challenging due to the small volume, complex shape, low contrast and discontinuous boundaries of hippocampus. Although some methods have been developed for the hippocampus segmentation, most of them paid too much attention to the hippocampus shape and volume instead of considering the spatial information. Additionally, the extracted features are independent of each other, ignoring the correlation between the global and local information. In view of this, here we proposed a novel cross-layer dual Encoding-Shared Decoding network framework with Spatial self-Attention mechanism (called ESDSA) for hippocampus segmentation in human brains. Considering that the hippocampus is a relatively small part in MRI, we introduced the spatial self-attention mechanism in ESDSA to capture the spatial information of hippocampus for improving the segmentation accuracy. We also designed a cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network to effectively extract the global information of MRIs and the spatial information of hippocampus. The spatial features of hippocampus and the features extracted from the MRIs were combined to realize the hippocampus segmentation. Results on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data show that the performance of our ESDSA is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, and the dice similarity coefficient of ESDSA achieves 89.37%. In addition, the dice similarity coefficient of the Spatial Self-Attention mechanism (SSA) strategy and the dual Encoding-Shared Decoding (ESD) strategy is 9.47%, 5.35% higher than that of the baseline U-net, respectively, indicating that the strategies of SSA and ESD can effectively enhance the segmentation accuracy of human brain hippocampus.\n",

Previously, we reported that α-Syn clusters synthetic proteoliposomes that mimic synaptic vesicles. This vesicle-clustering activity depends on a specific interaction of α-Syn with anionic phospholipids. Here, we report that α-Syn surprisingly also interacts with the neutral phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). Even in the absence of anionic lipids, lysoPC facilitates α-Syn-induced vesicle clustering but has no effect on Ca\n",

      "The aim of this study was to evaluate the functionality and effectiveness of a school digital mental health clinic (DMHC) created by a Chinese psychiatric hospital and provided to secondary school students for a trial.\n",
      "The trial period of the DMHC was from January to July 2021 at three secondary schools in Taizhou City, China. Under a collaborative agreement between the local educational bureau and provider, use of the DMHC was free to all students, teachers, and staff of the schools. The functionality of the DMHC was compared with existing digital health interventions introduced in the literature and its effectiveness was quantitatively analyzed in terms of the volume of received counseling calls, number of calls per 100 students, length and time of calls, and reasons for the calls. The mini course video views were analyzed by topics and viewing time.\n",
      "The design functions of the DMHC are well aligned with required factors defined in the literature. The first advantage of this DMHC is its high accessibility to students in the three schools. All functions of the DMHC are free to use by students, thereby eliminating the economic barriers to seeking and receiving care. Students can receive virtual counseling during or after regular working hours. Acceptability of the DHMC was further ensured by the full support from a national top-tier mental health facility. Any audio or video call from a student user would connect them to a live, qualified professional (ie, a psychiatrist or psychologist). Options are provided to view and listen to resources for stress relief or tips to help address mental health needs. The major reasons for the counseling calls included difficulties in learning, interpersonal relationships, and emotional distress. The three topics with the highest level of interest for the mini course videos were emotional assistance, personal growth, and family member relationships. The DMHC served as an effective tool for crisis prevention and intervention during nonworking hours as most of the live calls and mini video viewing occurred after school or over the weekend. Furthermore, the DMHC helped three students at high risk for suicide and self-injury through live-call intervention.\n",

It can resemble the shape of the true effect size distributions and accounts for non-linear, including interaction effects, among multi-omics data via kernel fusion. It infers its parameters via a computationally efficient variational Bayes algorithm.

      "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dream-enactment behaviors that emerge during a loss of REM sleep atonia. Untreated RBD carries risks for physical injury from falls or other traumatic events during dream enactment as well as risk of injury to the bed partner. Currently, melatonin and clonazepam are the mainstay pharmacological therapies for RBD. However, therapeutic response to these medications is variable. While older adults are most vulnerable to RBD, they are also particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, including increased risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Prazosin is a centrally active alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist often prescribed for trauma nightmares characterized by REM sleep without atonia in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. We report a case of successful RBD management with prazosin in a patient in whom high dose melatonin was ineffective. Although there was no observable reduction of dream-enactment behaviors with high dose melatonin, the possibility of a synergistic effect of prazosin combined with melatonin cannot be ruled out. This case report supports further evaluation of prazosin as a potential therapeutic for RBD.\n",

Furthermore, AD mice exhibited hippocampo-cortical circuit dysfunction demonstrated by decreased power of rhythmic oscillations at the theta (4-12 Hz) and gamma (25-50 Hz) frequencies in the hippocampus and mPFC, two functionally interconnected brain regions involved both in AD and compulsive behaviors. Importantly, coherence between the hippocampus and mPFC in the theta band of AD animals was significantly reduced.

The Covid 19 pandemic has once again placed a particular challenge on this vulnerable group. What started a decade earlier with telephone-based support groups experienced a real push during the pandemic in the form of video-based self-help services. The aim of this qualitative literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO with keywords related to online, support group, caregiver, and dementia was to collect the reported experiences by the end of 2022. Peer reviewed journal papers were included when published and written in English. After the joint decision of two reviewers, it was decided to only include studies that were published in Medline. The results of the literature search are compared with experiences of the participants in a presentation group that was transformed into an online group at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic via Zoom. In search yielded a total of 129 articles. 113 articles described different types of interventions, 30 of which had a randomized design. The qualitative literature search showed on the one hand a high interest in online support groups but on the other hand that the effectiveness and efficacy in randomized trials is much less clear. In addition, we investigated the assessments and experiences of the participants in a presentation group that was transformed into an online group at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic via Zoom. This study demonstrates that PLWD and carers on virtual group meetings can express significant emotive capacity and enhanced connectivity with one another despite a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia. Further research on entry criteria, concerns about online support services in general and necessary support for use is essential to develop the time- and location-independent possibility of video-based online self-help into an important form of support for both PLWD and their caregivers as an additional support option independent of exceptional pandemic situations.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, affecting approximately 6.5 million older adults in the United States. Development of AD treatment has primarily centered on developing pharmaceuticals that target amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain, a hallmark pathological biomarker that precedes symptomatic AD. Though recent clinical trials of novel drugs that target Aβ have demonstrated promising preliminary data, these pharmaceuticals have a poor history of developing into AD treatments, leading to hypotheses that other therapeutic targets may be more suitable for AD prevention and treatment. Impaired brain energy metabolism is another pathological hallmark that precedes the onset of AD that may provide a target for intervention. The brain creatine (Cr) system plays a crucial role in maintaining bioenergetic flux and is disrupted in AD. Recent studies using AD mouse models have shown that supplementing with Cr improves brain bioenergetics, as well as AD biomarkers and cognition. Despite these promising findings, no human trials have investigated the potential benefits of Cr supplementation in AD. This narrative review discusses the link between Cr and AD and the potential for Cr supplementation as a treatment for AD.\n",

Individuals with DS had the lowest mean level of vitamin D 25-OH at 20.67 ng/mL, compared to those with ASD (23.48 ng/mL) and NT controls (29.20 ng/mL) (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -8.97 to -6.44). A total of 399 (24.6%) individuals with DS were considered vitamin D deficient compared to 1472 (28.3%) with ASD and 12,397 (40.3%) NT controls (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -5.43 to -2.36). Individuals with DS with higher body mass index (BMI) were found to be more likely to have lower levels of vitamin D (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -0.3849 to -0.1509). Additionally, having both DS and a neurologic diagnosis increased the likelihood of having lower vitamin D levels (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -5.02 to -1.28). Individuals with DS and autoimmune disease were much more likely to have lower vitamin D levels (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -6.22 to -1.55). Similarly, a history of autoimmunity in a first-degree relative also increased the likelihood of having lower levels of vitamin D in persons with DS (p = 0.01, 95% CI: -2.45 to -0.63).\n",

      "Cognitive impairment has been reported as a potential sequela of COVID-19. Risk factors associated with this impairment include advanced age, severe infection, and prolonged duration of anosmia (loss of smell). Furthermore, COVID-19 has been reported as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease, and even mild infections have been associated with visuospatial cognitive impairments. While multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been implicated in COVID-19-related cognitive impairment, persistent infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is of particular interest due to its potential implications for treatment. Persistent infection could lead to cognitive impairments through mechanisms such as neurotoxicity mediated by spike proteins, neuroinflammation induced by cytokines, and neuronal cell fusion (syncytia). In terms of treatment, the effectiveness of vaccination has been demonstrated in meta-analyses, and drugs like metformin and antiviral agents hold promise.\n",
      "It has been suggested that higher triglyceride levels were associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to examine the association of triglycerides with dementia and cognition change in community-dwelling older adults.\n",
      "This prospective longitudinal study used data from the ASPREE randomized trial of adults aged ≥65 years without dementia or previous cardiovascular events at enrolment. The main outcome was incident dementia. Other outcomes included changes in composite cognition and domain-specific cognition (global cognition, memory, language and executive function, and psychomotor speed). The association between baseline triglycerides and dementia risk was estimated using Cox proportional-hazard models adjusting for relevant risk factors. Linear mixed models were used to investigate cognitive change. The analysis was repeated in a sub-cohort of participants with available \n",
      "The study included 18,294 ASPREE participants and 68,200 UK Biobank participants (mean age: 75.1 & 66.9 years; female: 56.3% & 52.7%; median [IQR] triglyceride:106 [80-142]mg/dl & 139 [101-193]mg/dl), with dementia recorded in 823 and 2,778 individuals over a median follow-up of 6.4 and 12.5 years, respectively. Higher triglyceride levels were associated with lower dementia risk in the entire ASPREE cohort (HR with doubling of TG: 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.94). Findings were similar in the sub-cohort of participants with APOE-ε4 genetic data (n=13,976), and in the UK Biobank cohort (HR was 0.82 and 0.83, respectively, all p≤0.01). Higher triglycerides were also associated with slower decline in global, composite cognition, and memory over time (p≤0.05).\n",
      "Older adults with higher triglyceride levels within the normal to high-normal range had a lower dementia risk and slower cognitive decline over time compared to individuals with lower triglyceride levels. Higher triglyceride levels may be reflective of better overall health and/or lifestyle behaviors that would protect against dementia development. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether specific components within the total circulating pool of plasma triglycerides may promote better cognitive function, with the hope of informing the development of new preventive strategies.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that damages patients' memory and cognitive abilities. Therefore, the diagnosis of AD holds significant importance. The interactions between regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain often involve multiple areas collaborating in a nonlinear manner. Leveraging these nonlinear higher-order interaction features to their fullest potential contributes to enhancing the accuracy of AD diagnosis. To address this, a framework combining nonlinear higher-order feature extraction and three-dimensional (3D) hypergraph neural networks is proposed for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD. First, a support vector machine regression model based on the radial basis function kernel was trained on ROI data to obtain a base estimator. Then, a recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the base estimator was applied to extract nonlinear higher-order features from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These features were subsequently constructed into a hypergraph, leveraging the complex interactions captured in the data. Finally, a four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal hypergraph convolutional neural network model was constructed based on the fMRI data for classification. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the Hyper Graph Convolutional Network (HyperGCN) framework by 8% and traditional two-dimensional (2D) linear feature extraction methods by 12% in the AD/normal control (NC) classification task. In conclusion, this framework demonstrates an improvement in AD classification compared to mainstream deep learning methods, providing valuable evidence for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD.\n",
      "阿尔茨海默症（AD）是一种不可逆转的大脑神经退化性疾病，会损害患者记忆力和认知能力。因此，AD诊断具有重要意义。大脑感兴趣区域（ROI）之间往往是多个区域以非线性的方式协同交互，充分利用此类非线性高阶交互特征有助于提高AD诊断分类的准确性。为此，提出基于非线性高阶特征提取和三维超图神经网络相结合的AD计算机辅助诊断框架。首先针对ROI数据使用基于径向基函数核的支持向量机回归模型训练出基估计器，再通过基于基估计器的递归特征消除算法提取功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）数据中的非线性高阶特征，进而将特征构造成超图，最后基于fMRI数据的四维时空特性搭建超图卷积神经网络模型来进行分类。阿尔茨海默症神经影像倡议（ADNI）数据库上的实验结果表明，所提框架在AD/正常对照（NC）分类任务上的效果相较于Hyper Graph Convolutional Network（HyperGCN）框架提高了8%，相较于传统二维线性特征提取方法提高了12%。综上，本文框架在AD分类效果上较主流深度学习方法有所提升，可为AD计算机辅助诊断提供有效依据。.\n",

Using a proximity extension assay, we aimed to identify candidate serum protein biomarkers for disease activity in CIDP.\n",
      "We collected clinical data and serum of 106 patients with CIDP. Patients starting induction treatment (n=53) and patients on maintenance treatment starting treatment withdrawal (n=40) were assessed at baseline and at 6 months (or at relapse). Patients in remission (n=13) were assessed once. Clinical disease activity was defined based on improvement or deterioration by the minimal clinically important difference on the inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale in combination with either grip strength or the Medical Research Council sum score. Using a proximity extension assay (Olink Explore platform), 1472 protein levels were analysed in serum. Candidate proteins were selected based on fold change>0.5 or <-0.5 and p<0.05 between clinically active and inactive disease. Longitudinal changes of candidate proteins between baseline and follow-up were analysed.\n",

      "Understanding the relationship between blood nutrients and neurodegeneration could contribute to devising strategies for preventing Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the associations between fatty acids, vitamins D, B6, B12, folate, and homocysteine and the cerebral load of amyloid β (Aβ). This cross-sectional study included 177 older adults (70 to 96 years, 65% female) with objective cognitive impairment, pre-frail, or frail. Cerebral Aβ load was determined using PET Standardized Uptake Value ratios (SUVr). Fatty acids were assessed in erythrocytes, vitamins D and homocysteine in serum, and the other vitamins in plasma. Linear regression models corrected for multiple comparisons evaluated the associations between each nutrient and Aβ. The principal component factor followed by linear regression grouped the fatty acids strongly correlated (factor) and associated with Aβ. Higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) clupanodonic acid (22:5n-3) (β: -0.13; p= 0.001), mead acid (20:3n-9) (β: -0.07; p= 0.036), and adrenic acid (22:4n-6) (β: -0.05; p=0.031) were associated with lower global Aβ load, while linoleic acid (18:2n-6) was associated with higher global Aβ load (β: 0.18; p= 0.042). Clupanodonic acid was inversely associated with Aβ in all cerebral regions except the thalamus. The factor composed of mead, clupanodonic, and arachidonic (20:4n-6) acids was associated with a lower global Aβ load (β: -0.02; p=0.002). Some erythrocyte PUFAs were inversely associated with Aβ load in the brain, and most of them were metabolites of the essential fatty acids linoleic and α-linolenic. Given the cross-sectional design, these results must be carefully interpreted, and longitudinal studies are needed.\n",

Syntactic, lexical, and semantic features were assessed via the NILC-Metrix software, and the features were correlated with episodic, working, and semantic memory assessment.\n",
      "Differences were found in 7 of the 34 features assessed. Syntactically, the group diagnosed with AD produced narratives with fewer sentences, fewer words per sentence, and lower Yngve depth scores. Lexically, the AD group produced narratives with fewer words and prepositions per sentence. Semantically, the narratives produced by the AD group featured words with a lower mean age of acquisition, and lower Brunét's index scores. For the CG group, episodic memory performance correlated with the ratio of conjunctions. No other significant correlation was found for semantic and working memory in the CG. No correlation was found between memory performance and linguistic features for the AD group.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The characteristic pathological manifestation of AD includes the deposition of extracellular insoluble β amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed from hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Cost effective and minimally invasive peripheral blood-based biomarkers are critical for early AD diagnosis. Currently, the plasma based two fraction of β amyloid peptide ratio (Aβ42/40) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are considered as blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Recent research indicates that oxidative stress (OS) occurs prior to amyloid plaque (Aβ) formation and abnormal tau phosphorylation in AD. The imbalance of the master antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), and prooxidants (iron, zinc, and copper)─plays a crucial role in AD neurodegeneration. We present peripheral blood-based OS related biomarkers that are mechanistically involved in the disease process and may serve as a novel screening tool for early detection of AD onset. This OS based approach may also provide a quick and cost efficient method to monitor the effects of disease-modifying therapies in AD clinical trials.\n",

      "Post-translational modifications of Tau are emerging as key players in determining the onset and progression of different tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, and are recognized to mediate the structural diversity of the disease-specific Tau amyloids. Here we show that the E3 ligase CHIP catalyzes the site-specific ubiquitination of Tau filaments both in vitro and in cellular models, proving that also Tau amyloid aggregates are direct substrate of PTMs. Transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry analysis on ubiquitin-modified Tau amyloids revealed that the conformation of the filaments restricts CHIP-mediated ubiquitination to specific positions of the repeat domain, while only minor alterations in the structure of the fibril core were inferred using seeding experiments in vitro and in a cell-based tauopathy model. Overexpression of CHIP significantly increased the ubiquitination of exogenous PHF, proving that the ligase can interact and modify Tau aggregates also in a complex cellular environment.\n",

Further, our findings demonstrate that digital dementia information written in English has a negative tone, which may be a contributing factor to the mental health crisis many people with dementia face after receiving a diagnosis. Therefore, we call for content creators to lower readability scores to make the information more accessible to a general audience and to focus their efforts on providing information in a way that does not perpetuate overly negative narratives of dementia.\n",
      "Fatty acids are metabolized by β-oxidation within the \"mitochondrial ketogenic pathway\" (MKP) to generate β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body. BHB can be generated by most cells but largely by hepatocytes following exercise, fasting, or ketogenic diet consumption. BHB has been shown to modulate systemic and brain inflammation; however, its direct effects on microglia have been little studied. We investigated the impact of BHB on Aβ oligomer (AβO)-stimulated human iPS-derived microglia (hiMG), a model relevant to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). HiMG responded to AβO with proinflammatory activation, which was mitigated by BHB at physiological concentrations of 0.1-2 mM. AβO stimulated glycolytic transcripts, suppressed genes in the β-oxidation pathway, and induced over-expression of AD-relevant p46Shc, an endogenous inhibitor of thiolase, actions that are expected to suppress MKP. AβO also triggered mitochondrial Ca\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease, marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, is associated with amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide accumulation in the brain. The enzyme neprilysin (NEP), crucial for Aβ degradation, decreases with age and in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, leading to increased Aβ build-up. This study hypothesized the targeting of enzyme HDAC6, believed to influence NEP activity. An in-silico study was conducted using an FDA-approved drug database, with the focus on their interaction with the HDAC6 structure. Among tested ligands, Panobinostat showed the most favourable interaction with HDAC6. In-vitro experiments on the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line confirmed these findings, with Panobinostat inhibiting HDAC6, enhancing NEP levels, and reducing Aβ load. The study suggests Panobinostat as a potential Alzheimer's therapeutic agent, mitigating Aβ accumulation \n",
      "The aggregation of tau protein in the form of paired helical filament (PHF) leads to the breakdown of microtubule structure and the development of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, inhibiting tau protein aggregation is a potential strategy for preventing the progression of these disorders. In this study, sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), an antibiotic that easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and interacts with tau protein, was tested for its ability to inhibit tau aggregation \n",
      "Pyroptosis-mediated neuron death plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effect of 1,7-diphenyl-4-hepten-3-one (C1), a natural diarylheptanoid, on AD is unclear. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic effect of C1 on APP/PS1 mice and β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced HT22 cells. Our findings showed that C1 attenuated cognitive impairment and mitigated pathological damage in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, we found that C1 prevented oxidative stress damage and decreased the levels of pyroptosis-related proteins. In vitro experiments showed that C1 can improve the proliferation of Aβ-induced HT22 cells and decrease the levels of pyroptosis-related proteins in them. When Nrf2 was silenced, the positive effects of C1 in inhibiting pyroptosis were inhibited. Particularly, the production of pyroptosis-associated proteins, including NLRP3, GSDMD, and caspase-1, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules, including IL-1 and IL-18, were increased. Altogether, these findings indicate that C1 can mitigate AD-like pathology via the inhibition of pyroptosis by activating the Nrf2 pathway. We believe that this study can provide alternative strategies for the prevention and treatment of AD.\n",
      "Dementia in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive neurological condition affecting millions worldwide. The amphiphilic molecule GM2 gangliosides are abundant in the human brain and play important roles in neuronal development, intercellular recognition, myelin stabilization, and signal transduction. GM2 ganglioside's degradation requires hexosaminidase A (HexA), a heterodimer composed of an α subunit encoded by HEXA and a β subunit encoded by HEXB. The hydrolysis of GM2 also requires a non-enzymatic protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2-AP), encoded by GM2A. Pathogenic mutations of HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A are responsible for autosomal recessive diseases known as GM2 gangliosidosis, caused by the excessive intralysosomal accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. In AD, PD and DLB, GM2 ganglioside accumulation is reported to facilitate Aβ and α-synuclein aggregation into toxic oligomers and plaques through activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as protein kinase C (PKC) and oxidative stress factors. This review explored the potential role of GM2 ganglioside alteration in toxic protein aggregations and its related signaling pathways leading to neurodegenerative diseases. Further review explored potential therapeutic approaches, which include synthetic and phytomolecules targeting GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the brain, holding a promise for providing new and effective management for dementia.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that disrupts cognitive function and severely affects the quality of life. Existing drugs only improve cognitive function and provide temporary relief of symptoms but do not stop or delay disease progression. Recently, natural medicines, especially Chinese herbal medicines, have gained attention in the treatment of AD due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. However, conventional oral dosage forms lack brain specificity and have side effects that lead to poor patient compliance. Utilizing nanomedicine is a promising approach to improve brain specificity, bioavailability, and patient compliance. This review evaluates recent advances in the treatment of AD with nanoparticles containing various natural medicines. This review highlights that nanoparticles containing natural medicines are a promising strategy for the treatment of AD. It is believed that this technology can be translated into the clinic, thereby providing opportunities for AD patients to participate in social activities.\n",
      "Non-invasive methods of detecting early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) can provide valuable insight into disease pathology, improving the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) MRI is a technique that provides image contrast sensitive to lipid and protein content in the brain. These macromolecules have been shown to be altered in Alzheimer's pathology, with early disruptions in cell membrane integrity and signaling pathways leading to the buildup of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. We used template-based analyzes of NOE MRI data and the characteristic Z-spectrum, with parameters optimized for increase specificity to NOE, to detect changes in lipids and proteins in an AD mouse model that recapitulates features of human AD. We find changes in NOE contrast in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria, with these changes likely attributed to disruptions in the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes in both gray and white matter regions. This study suggests that NOE MRI may be a useful tool for monitoring early-stage changes in lipid-mediated metabolism in AD and other disorders with high spatial resolution.\n",
      "Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis (TCCA) is a commonly employed statistical method utilized to examine linear associations between two sets of tensor datasets. However, the existing TCCA models fail to adequately address the heterogeneity present in real-world tensor data, such as brain imaging data collected from diverse groups characterized by factors like sex and race. Consequently, these models may yield biased outcomes. In order to surmount this constraint, we propose a novel approach called Multi-Group TCCA (MG-TCCA), which enables the joint analysis of multiple subgroups. By incorporating a dual sparsity structure and a block coordinate ascent algorithm, our MG-TCCA method effectively addresses heterogeneity and leverages information across different groups to identify consistent signals. This novel approach facilitates the quantification of shared and individual structures, reduces data dimensionality, and enables visual exploration. To empirically validate our approach, we conduct a study focused on investigating correlations between two brain positron emission tomography (PET) modalities (AV-45 and FDG) within an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort. Our results demonstrate that MG-TCCA surpasses traditional TCCA in identifying sex-specific cross-modality imaging correlations. This heightened performance of MG-TCCA provides valuable insights for the characterization of multimodal imaging biomarkers in AD.\n",

      "Classical theories of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and flow are taught throughout medical education. The idea that CSF is produced and/or filtered by the choroid plexus and flows in one direction throughout the ventricular system has been a largely accepted thesis. However, modern studies have called into question the validity of this hypothesis, suggesting that CSF does not move unidirectionally but rather is driven by microvessel contractions in a to-and-fro manner throughout the cerebrospinal system. Moreover, new insights suggest that in addition to CSF production, the exchange of fluids and proteins between the cortical vasculature and the interstitium may function as the brain's version of a lymphatic system. This comprehensive review provides evidence for a different framework of CSF flow. One that includes perivascular pulsations that push CSF back and forth, allowing exchange between the CSF and interstitium, and with CSF production occurring throughout the cerebrospinal system. These findings could be revolutionary in understanding the pathophysiology of CSF flow and in the treatment of pathologies such as intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, Alzheimer's disease, and many others.\n",

Repeated measures of cognition over 12 years are collected. An MDMS is designed based on serum biomarkers related to MD key food groups and using a targeted metabolomics platform. Associations with CD are investigated through conditional logistic regression (matched on age, sex, and education level) in both sample sets. The MDMS is found to be inversely associated with CD (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.90 [0.80-1.00]; p = 0.048) in the Bordeaux (discovery) cohort. Results are comparable in the Dijon (validation) cohort, with a trend toward significance (OR [95% CI] = 0.91 [0.83-1.01]; p = 0.084).\n",

Blood samples of 36 subjects presenting with cognitive decline to the neurology OPDs of Dow and Civil hospitals, Karachi, were centrifuged, and plasma was stored at -80℃. Before analysis, it was thawed at 4℃ and protein levels were measured through ELISA. Two-thirds of the patients were females but age distribution across both the groups was not significantly different (p=0.21). No difference was observed in the mean plasma concentrations of Aβ42, P-Tau, and NFL between the two groups (p-values 0.78 and 0.27 and 0.09 respectively). Our study suggests that despite being promising in CSF, Aβ42, P-Tau, and NFL cannot differentiate between different neurodegenerative dementias when measured in plasma.\n",

This review examines the etiology of the association between OSA and the non-dipper pattern of hypertension and how both are involved in the development of AD. To set the stage for this review, we first focus on the pathophysiology of AD, which is interrelated with sleep apnea and non-dipper through dysregulation of central autonomic network.\n",
      "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older individuals. AD is characterized pathologically by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, with associated loss of synapses and neurons, which eventually results in dementia. Many of the early attempts to develop treatments for AD focused on Aβ, but a lack of efficacy of these treatments in terms of slowing disease progression led to a change of strategy towards targeting of tau pathology. Given that tau shows a stronger correlation with symptom severity than does Aβ, targeting of tau is more likely to be efficacious once cognitive decline begins. Anti-tau therapies initially focused on post-translational modifications, inhibition of tau aggregation and stabilization of microtubules. However, trials of many potential drugs were discontinued because of toxicity and/or lack of efficacy. Currently, the majority of tau-targeting agents in clinical trials are immunotherapies. In this Review, we provide an update on the results from the initial immunotherapy trials and an overview of new therapeutic candidates that are in clinical development, as well as considering future directions for tau-targeting therapies.\n",
      "Brain aging causes a progressive decline in functional capacity and is a strong risk factor for dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. To characterize age-related proteomic changes in the brain, we used quantitative proteomics to examine brain tissues, cortex and hippocampus, of mice at three age points (3, 15, and 24 months old), and quantified more than 7000 proteins in total with high reproducibility. We found that many of the proteins upregulated with age were extracellular proteins, such as extracellular matrix proteins and secreted proteins, associated with glial cells. On the other hand, many of the significantly downregulated proteins were associated with synapses, particularly postsynaptic density, specifically in the cortex but not in the hippocampus. Our datasets will be helpful as resources for understanding the molecular basis of brain aging.\n",
      "The accurate prediction of patients with complex diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as disease stages, including early- and late-stage cancer, is challenging owing to substantial variability among patients and limited availability of clinical data. Deep metric learning has emerged as a promising approach for addressing these challenges by improving data representation. In this study, we propose a joint triplet loss model with a semi-hard constraint (JTSC) to represent data in a small number of samples. JTSC strictly selects semi-hard samples by switching anchors and positive samples during the learning process in triplet embedding and combines a triplet loss function with an angular loss function. Our results indicate that JTSC significantly improves the number of appropriately represented samples during training when applied to the gene expression data of AD and to cancer stage prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using an embedding vector from JTSC as an input to the classifiers for AD and cancer stage prediction significantly improves classification performance by extracting more accurate features. In conclusion, we show that feature embedding through JTSC can aid in classification when there are a small number of samples compared to a larger number of features.\n",

We therefore tested the performance of these plasma biomarkers in 126 participants with preclinical AD and 123 controls with 8-10 years of follow-up from the China Cognition and Aging Study. Plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL were significantly correlated with cerebrospinal fluid counterparts and significantly altered in participants with preclinical AD. Combining plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL successfully discriminated preclinical AD from controls. These findings were validated in a replication cohort including 51 familial AD mutation carriers and 52 non-carriers from the Chinese Familial Alzheimer's Disease Network.

      "Peptides and proteins have recently emerged as efficient therapeutic alternatives to conventional therapies. Although their advent a few decades back, extensive exploration of various ailments or disorders began recently. The drawbacks of current chemotherapies and irradiation treatments such as drug resistance and damage to healthy tissues have enabled the rise of the peptides as quest for better prospects. The chemical tunability and smaller size make them easy to design selectively for target tissues. Other remarkable properties include antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, protection from hemorrhage stroke, and as therapeutic agents for gastric disorders, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Despite these unmatched properties, their practical applicability is often hindered due to their weak susceptibility to enzymatic digestion, degradation in serum, metabolism in the liver, clearance by the kidney, and immunogenic reactions. There are several methods adapted in order to increase the half-life of peptides such as chemical modifications, fusing with Fc fragment, change in amino acid composition, and by using carrier-based delivery. Among these, nano-carrier-mediated encapsulation not only increases the half-life of the peptides \n",

      "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may be involved in the increased sensitivity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to antipsychotics, including amisulpride. Studies indicate that antipsychotics interact with facilitated glucose transporters (GLUT), including GLUT1, and that GLUT1 BBB expression decreases in AD. We tested the hypotheses that amisulpride (charge: +1) interacts with GLUT1, and that BBB transport of amisulpride is compromised in AD. GLUT1 substrates, GLUT1 inhibitors and GLUT-interacting antipsychotics were identified by literature review and their physicochemical characteristics summarised. Interactions between amisulpride and GLUT1 were studied using in silico approaches and the human cerebral endothelial cell line, hCMEC/D3. Brain distribution of [3H]amisulpride was determined using in situ perfusion in wild type (WT) and 5xFamilial AD (5xFAD) mice. With transmission electron microscopy (TEM) we investigated brain capillary degeneration in WT mice, 5xFAD mice and human samples. Western blots determined BBB transporter expression in mouse and human. Literature review revealed that, although D-glucose has no charge, charged molecules can interact with GLUT1. GLUT1 substrates are smaller (184.95±6.45g/mol) than inhibitors (325.50±14.40g/mol) and GLUT-interacting antipsychotics (369.38±16.04). Molecular docking showed beta-D-glucose (free energy binding: -15.39kcal/mol) and amisulpride (-29.04kcal/mol) interact with GLUT1. Amisulpride did not affect [14C]D-glucose hCMEC/D3 accumulation. [3H]amisulpride uptake into the brain (except supernatant) of 5xFAD mice compared to WT remained unchanged. TEM revealed brain capillary degeneration in human AD. There was no difference in GLUT1 or P-glycoprotein BBB expression between WT and 5xFAD mice. In contrast, caudate P-glycoprotein, but not GLUT1, expression was decreased in human AD capillaries versus controls. This study provides new details about the BBB transport of amisulpride, evidence that amisulpride interacts with GLUT1 and that BBB transporter expression is altered in AD. This suggests that antipsychotics could potentially exacerbate the cerebral hypometabolism in AD. Further research into the mechanism of amisulpride transport by GLUT1 is important for improving antipsychotics safety.\n",

      "This study aimed to analyze whether taurine has a nootropic effect on short-term and long-term memory in a model of sporadic dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT). Moreover, we evaluated the immunoreactivity and insulin receptor (IR) distribution and markers for neurons and glial cells in the hippocampus of rats with SDAT and treated with taurine. For this, Male Wistar rats received STZ (ICV, 3 mg/kg, bilateral, 5ul per site, aCFS vehicle) and were treated with taurine (100 mg/kg orally, 1 time per day, saline vehicle) for 25 days. The animals were divided into 4 groups: vehicle (VE), taurine (TAU), ICV-STZ (STZ) and ICV-STZ plus taurine (STZ + TAU). At the end of taurine treatment, short- and long-term memory were assessed by performance on object recognition and Y-maze tasks. Insulin receptor (IR) was evaluated by immunoperoxidase while mature neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP, S100B, SOX9), and microglia (Iba-1) were evaluated by immunofluorescence. STZ induced worse spatial and recognition memory (INDEX) in YM and ORT tasks. Taurine protected against STZ-induced memory impairment. SDAT reduced the population of mature neurons as well as increased astrocytic and microglial reactivity, and taurine protected against these STZ-induced effects, mainly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Taurine increases IR expression in the hippocampus, and protects against the reduction in the density of this receptor in CA1 induced by STZ. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that taurine is able to enhance memory, up-regulates IR in the hippocampus, protects the neuron population, and reduces the astrogliosis found in SDAT.\n",
      "Kai-Xin-San (KXS) is a classic famous prescription composed of Polygalae Radix, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, and Poria. Clinically, KXS is effective in treating amnesia and regulating cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas its mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, the AD model rats were established by combining intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose (150 mg/kg/day) and intracerebral injection of Aβ\n",
      "The exploration of multitarget molecules presents a promising avenue in the quest for effective therapeutic strategies against Alzheimer's disease (AD), a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. Traditional single-target drugs have shown limited success due to the complex interplay of pathological processes involved in AD. Multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs), designed to interact with multiple targets simultaneously, offer a more holistic approach to address the multifaceted nature of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of chalcones and huprine derivatives in mitigating amyloid-β peptide-associated toxicity and preserving membrane integrity, crucial for cellular homeostasis. The interaction of these compounds with lipid bilayers may modulate biological responses, opening a new realm of investigation in membrane-centric phenomena. This approach not only broadens the mechanistic understanding of bioactive compounds but also underscores the need for a paradigm shift in AD research, focusing on both intracellular targets and plasma membrane protection for more effective treatment strategies.\n",
      "Cataract is the leading cause of blindness around the world. Previous investigations have assessed the relationship between cataract, cataract surgery and dementia risk, but their results remain controversial. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations between cataract, cataract surgery and the risk of dementia.\n",
      "We systemically screened the literature from three electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL until April 2023. The data were collected by two independent researchers. The hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) from eligible studies with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted into the risk ratios (RRs), which were pooled using the random-effects model.\n",
      "A total of nine studies with 448,140 participants reported the associations between cataract or cataract surgery and the risk of dementia were included in this meta-analysis. The outcomes of our pooled analysis indicated that cataract was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (RR = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.14-1.35, p < .00001), Alzheimer's disease (RR = 1.22, 95% CI, 1.10-1.35, p = .0002) and vascular dementia (RR = 1.29, 95% CI, 1.01-1.66, p = .04). Cataract surgery is associated with a reduction of the dementia risk (RR = 0.74, 95% CI, 0.67-0.81, p < .00001).\n",

Individuals older than 65 years, without unspecified retinal vascular occlusion or dementia were included from 1998 to 2020 and followed until 2022. We calculated the incidence rate (IR) and performed a Cox regression analysis with a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for RVO (exposure) as a marker of all-cause dementia adjusted for systemic comorbidity.\n",

We performed a Cox regression analysis for age-dependent exposure due to non-proportional hazards in the pre-planned analysis. Exposed individuals younger than 75 years had an increased risk of all-cause dementia (adjusted HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18), whereas individuals older than 75 years had a decreased risk of all-cause dementia (adjusted HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.98).\n",

      "Many treatment initiatives, like herbal products and their active ingredients, aim to alleviate neurodegeneration to increase cognitive functions. Kaempferol may be a candidate molecule for treating neurodegeneration because of its antioxidant effects. In the present study, we examined the molecular changes associated with kaempferol's memory‑enhancing effects on streptozotocin (STZ)‑induced neurodegeneration. After intracerebroventricular STZ injection in Long‑Evans male rats, intraperitoneal kaempferol was administered for 12 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to measure learning and memory performance in the rats, and proteins related to memory formation were investigated in the hippocampi with western blotting. Kaempferol improved learning performance and memory decline in STZ‑treated rats. At the molecular level, STZ‑induced neurodegeneration resulted in a decrease in the expression of GAD67, reelin, and phosphorylated‑NMDAR. However, kaempferol treatment ameliorated these changes by enhancing their levels similar to the controls. While neither STZ injection nor kaempferol treatment produced any significant change in phosphorylated‑CAMKII levels, they increased the expression of klotho and prealbumin. These results show that kaempferol has positive effects on memory loss, affecting synaptic plasticity by ameliorating both the levels and activity of memory‑relevant molecules through reelin signaling. In summary, this study provides a guide to future studies by examining in detail the healing effect of kaempferol as a candidate molecule in the treatment of neurodegeneration, such as that observed in Alzheimer's disease.\n",

      "Searches were completed across six databases (Medline, PsycINFO, WoS, LILACS, ProQUEST, and CINAHL). Studies were required to capture attitudes and/or knowledge of ADRD or brain health among US-based Latino adults who were not cognitively impaired and were not caregivers or healthcare providers. Results were synthesized narratively.\n",
      "A total of 5528 unique records were identified. Following de-duplication and screening, 24 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Overall, knowledge about brain health and ADRD among Latinos is quite mixed. A consistent finding was that participants recognized memory loss as a symptom of cognitive impairment, but demonstrated limited recognition of other signs of impairment. The studies also highlighted variable knowledge of protective factors for maintaining brain health.\n",

However, because of racial/ethnic homogeneity in prior studies focused on identifying these associations in predominantly White cohorts, less is known about the generalizability of these putative psychosocial mechanisms in a diverse population. Thus, we evaluated whether lower levels of loneliness were associated with better cognitive performance in our sample.\n",

Lower levels of loneliness were associated with varying cognitive domains after adjustment for age, gender, and education; and persisted after additional adjustments of vascular risk factors.\n",
      "Self-reported lower loneliness was associated with higher levels of cognitive performance in a rural South African cohort of Black older adults. Although these findings and the potential of reverse causality need to be further validated, our results suggest that an intervention study may be merited to assess whether reducing loneliness lessens vulnerability to cognitive decline.\n",

      "Barriers and facilitators explored in the focus groups and survey were related to health and AD (e.g., AD-related concerns and past participation/willingness to participate in health or AD studies); current use of mobile devices (e.g., comfort using devices and receptivity to the AD recruitment registry); and participant characteristics and beliefs (e.g., demographics, health literacy level, and trust in government and the scientific community).\n",
      "The focus groups and survey revealed similar findings. Participants commonly use mobile devices to go online and perform health-related activities. They were aware of AD, expressed concerns with developing it, and were willing to participate in AD-related studies (motivated by personal connection to AD, altruism, and compensation). When presented with the AD recruitment registry, most provided positive feedback (e.g., easy to use and informative) and shared an interest in joining. Barriers to joining the registry with a mobile device included complex or multistep enrollment processes, beliefs that studies are primarily for those with a specific disease, and confusion about how studies can prevent AD among those low-risk for AD. The focus groups also revealed that Black/African American participants expressed more hesitation than Hispanic/Latinos in joining the registry due to greater distrust in the government and scientific community.\n",

Its objectives are to determine (1) whether carrying the APOE ε4 allele is associated with lower delivery of DHA to the brain; and (2) whether high dose DHA supplementation affects brain imaging biomarkers of AD and cognitive function.\n",
      "365 cognitively unimpaired individuals between 55 and 80 (mean age 66) were randomized to 2 grams of DHA per day or identically appearing placebo for a period of 2 years. Half the participants were asked to complete lumbar punctures at baseline and 6-month visits to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The primary trial outcome measure is the change in CSF DHA to arachidonic acid ratio after 6 months of the intervention (n=181). Secondary trial outcomes include the change in functional and structural connectivity using resting state functional MRI at 24 months (n=365). Exploratory outcomes include the change in Repeatable Battery of the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status at 24 months (n=365).\n",

      "S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is a pivotal metabolite in multiple pathways required for neuronal homeostasis, several of which are compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Correction of the SAMe deficiency that is characteristic of the AD brain may attenuate or prevent pathological processes driving AD-associated neurodegeneration including aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation and DNA hypomethylation.\n",
      "The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that daily treatment with 400 mg oral SAMe for 180 days will lead to a greater reduction from baseline in plasma levels of p-tau181 compared to placebo in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD.\n",
      "This is a phase II, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 60 participants with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SAMe or matching placebo, to be taken as an adjunct to their AD standard of care.\n",
      "The primary outcome is change in plasma p-tau181 concentration between baseline and following 180 days of treatment, which will be compared between the active and placebo group. Secondary outcomes are the safety of SAMe administration (incidence of serious adverse events), change from baseline in cognitive performance (as measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status), and epigenetic changes in DNA methylation.\n",
      "Demonstration of effective and safe lowering of plasma p-tau181 with SAMe in this phase II trial would pave the way for an exciting field of translational research and a larger phase III trial.\n",
      "While the U.S. National Institute on Aging has developed a strategy for recruitment of minority populations in dementia research, including increasing awareness and engagement, minority populations remain under-represented, and the evidence-base is limited.

      "In this 2-phase project, input from the minority advisory board of the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center informed development of 2 brief health communication videos which differentially focused on research barriers and facilitators (POWER) versus an education control (Phase 1). In Phase 2, a randomized prospective survey compared POWER vs. an active comparator control on pre/post video change in dementia knowledge, cumulative barriers, and facilitators to dementia research, and change in research readiness measured by the Transtheoretical behavior change model.

Non-white participants made up 41.1% of the analyzable POWER (n=51) and 44.1% (n= 52) of controls. Adjusted for age, gender, race and education, controls had a greater increase in dementia knowledge (p=0.004). There was a significant reduction in barriers for POWER (p=.044) vs. control. There were no differences in research facilitators and research readiness between POWER vs. control.

It is currently in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders where cognition is impaired and is also considered for indications such as depression or other neuropsychiatric diseases. ACD856 has a novel mechanism of action modulating the activity of the Trk-receptors, resulting in increased stimulation of the neurotrophin signaling pathways. Previous studies applying single intravenous and oral doses of ACD856 indicate that ACD856 is safe and well-tolerated by healthy volunteer subjects, and that it has suitable safety and pharmacokinetic properties for further clinical development.\n",

      "Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events, laboratory, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, assessment of stool frequency and questionnaires to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as suicidal ideation and behavior. In addition, cardiodynamic ECGs were extracted to evaluate cardiac safety. PK parameters were calculated based on measured concentrations of ACD856 in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Metabolite profiling, characterization and analysis was performed based on and urine samples. qEEG was recorded for patients in the two highest dose cohorts (30 and 90 mg/day) as a pharmacodynamic assessment to explore central target engagement.\n",
      "Treatment with ACD856 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. No treatment emergent or dose related trends were observed for any of the safety assessments. ACD856 was rapidly absorbed and reached maximum plasma exposure at 30 to 45 minutes after administration. Steady state was reached before Day 6, with an elimination half-life at steady state of approximately 20 hours. At steady state, ACD856 exhibited accumulation ratios for Cmax and AUC of approximately 1.6 and 1.9 respectively. The exposure, Cmax and AUC0-24, increased proportionally with the dose. There was no unchanged ACD856 detected in urine. The metabolic pattern in urine and plasma was similar, and in alignment with the metabolites observed in preclinical toxicology studies. The level of ACD856 measured in CSF at steady state increased with dose, indicating Central Nervous System (CNS) exposure at relevant levels for pharmacodynamic effects. ACD856 demonstrated significant dose-dependent treatment-associated changes on qEEG parameters. Specifically, increase of the relative theta power and decrease of the fast alpha and beta power was observed, leading to an acceleration of the delta+theta centroid and an increase in the theta/beta ratio.\n",

      "Aducanumab is the first FDA-approved amyloid-lowering immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease. There is little real-world data to guide management of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), a potentially serious side-effect which requires surveillance with magnetic resonance imaging. We report our experiences in managing ARIA in patients receiving aducanumab at the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program during the year following FDA approval. We followed the Appropriate Use Recommendations for aducanumab to guide patient selection, detection, and management of ARIA (1). ARIA-E occurred in 6 out of 24 participants treated; all APOE-ε4 carriers. Treatment was discontinued in 4 cases of moderate-severe ARIA-E, temporarily held in 1 moderate case, and dosed through in 1 mild case (mean duration = 3 months, range, 1-6 months). No participants required hospitalization or high dose corticosteroids. Participants on anticoagulation were excluded and no macrohemorrhages occurred.

      "Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that poses a significant societal burden. Approval of anti-amyloid antibody therapies is a significant milestone for treatment that was enabled by the inclusion of biomarkers. The use of biomarkers in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease has enabled selective participant recruitment, improved treatment monitoring, and supported more rigorous trial designs. This review discusses emerging biomarkers associated with the biology of aging and their application in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Aging is the primary risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease and is associated with biological processes implicated in disease development and progression. Novel therapies targeting these underlying biological aging processes are currently undergoing clinical development. Biomarkers that capture the biology of aging are integral to accelerating the development of these therapies. Current progress in biomarker development demonstrates efforts to capture the full spectrum of aging biology. Further work is needed to expand the range of biomarkers that enable comprehensive assessment of brain pathology and aid in prognosis, diagnosis, and measuring treatment response. Establishing a comprehensive arsenal of biomarkers will support strategic decision making and increase the likelihood of positive clinical trials and drug registration for the next generation of Alzheimer's disease drugs targeting the biology of aging.\n",
      "At least 40% of all dementia has been linked to modifiable risk factors suggesting a clear potential for preventative approaches targeting these factors. Despite the recent promising findings from anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, a limited proportion of patients are expected to be eligible for these novel AD treatments. Given the heterogeneous nature of AD and the complex multi-level pathological processes leading to dementia (involving, e.g., shared risk factors, interaction of different pathology mechanisms, and their putative synergistic effects on cognition), targeting a single pathology may not be sufficient to halt or significantly impact disease progression. With exponentially increasing numbers of patients world-wide, in parallel to the unprecedented population ageing, new multimodal therapy approaches targeting several modifiable risk factors and disease mechanisms simultaneously are urgently required. Developing the next generation of combination therapies with lifestyle intervention and pharmacological treatments, implementing the right interventions for the right people at the right time, and defining accessible and sustainable strategies worldwide are crucial. Here, we summarize the state-of-the-art multimodal lifestyle-based approaches, especially findings and lessons learned from the FINGER trial, for prevention and risk reduction of cognitive impairment and dementia. We also discuss some emerging underlying biological mechanisms and the current development of precision prevention approaches. We present an example of a novel trial design combining healthy lifestyle changes with a repurposed putative disease-modifying drug and place this study in the context of the World-Wide FINGERS, the first interdisciplinary network of multimodal trials dedicated to the prevention and risk reduction of cognitive impairment and dementia.\n",
      "Metformin is a safe and effective medication for Type 2 diabetes (T2D) that has been proposed to decrease the risk of aging related disorders including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD related disorders (ADRD). This review seeks to summarize findings from human and non-human studies examining the association of metformin with AD/ADRD related outcomes. Studies in animal models suggest that metformin could decrease the risk of AD/ADRD through multiple mechanisms including neuroprotective effects, decreasing neuroinflammation, and decreasing AD pathology. However, there are non-human studies that suggest that metformin could increase the risk of AD/ADRD. Observational human studies are also conflicting, but those with better study designs suggest that metformin use in persons with T2D is associated with a lower risk of dementia. However, these observational studies are limited by the use of administrative data to ascertain metformin use and/or cognitive outcomes. There are few clinical trials in persons without T2D that have small sample sizes and short durations but suggest that metformin could prevent AD/ADRD. There are ongoing studies including large clinical trials with long duration that are testing the effect of metformin on AD/ADRD outcomes in persons without T2D at risk for dementia.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which contributes to millions of cases of dementia worldwide. The dominant theoretical models of Alzheimer's disease propose that the brain passively succumbs to disruptions in proteostasis, neuronal dysfunction, inflammatory and other processes, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and dementia. However, an emerging body of evidence suggests that the adult brain is endowed with endogenous mechanisms of resilience which may enable individuals to remain cognitively intact for years despite underlying pathology. In this brief review, we discuss evidence from basic neuroscience and clinical research which demonstrates the existence of endogenous molecular signaling pathways that can promote resilience to neurodegeneration. The p75 neurotrophin receptor provides one such pathway of resilience due to its role as a fundamental signaling switch which determines neuronal survival or degeneration. We highlight a series of preclinical studies targeting the p75 neurotrophin receptor in mouse models which demonstrate resilience to amyloid. We briefly discuss the design and goals of a recent clinical trial of p75 neurotrophin receptor modulation in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Unique challenges for developing therapeutics and biomarkers which are optimized for targeting and detecting endogenous mechanisms of resilience are also discussed. Altogether, this review motivates further trial work of therapeutics modulating the p75 neurotrophin receptor and other deep biology targets.\n",
      "Neuroinflammation precedes the clinical onset of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), by years or frequently even decades (1-3). In terms of the underlying physiology, there is a great need for understanding and controlling interactions between the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system in an attempt to develop approaches to prevent or delay the disease's progression. Nerve cells have limited motion capability, whereas immune cells can migrate freely via circulation. This difference raises a variety of questions in the context of senile plaque formation and phagocytosis. Broad-scale unbiased genomic studies bring several genetic variants such as sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 3 (CD33), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) or complement receptor type 1 (CR1) into the focus of researchers' attention as potential risk factors for neuroinflammation. In addition, advanced proteomic analyses have been revealing links between these genetic contributors and complex, malfunctioning signaling pathways (including the upregulation of factors like tumor necrosis factor TNF-α, tumor growth factor TGF-β and interleukin IL-1α) that promote proinflammatory mechanisms via intracellular signaling and trafficking, synaptic function, and cell metabolism/ proliferation. In AD, the brain's microglia and astrocytes, which are normally responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of synaptic transmission and its remodeling by pruning, are the initiators of neuroinflammation and toxic tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. Thus, they drive the CNS into a state of sustained or even self-accelerated deterioration. Here we aim to review the cell types and mediators involved in neuroinflammation and AD, the symptom manifestation in clinical settings, and potential candidates for improving diagnosis and treatment.\n",
      "Despite recent FDA approval of anti-amyloid antibodies for Alzheimer's Disease, strategies that target early molecular mechanisms and could delay or change the disease trajectory are still needed. Mitochondria emerge as a signaling organelle that could modulate multiple molecular mechanisms to enhance cellular bioenergetics and promote neuronal survival. Approaches to enhance mitochondrial function could promote healthy aging delaying the onset of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. Some of these strategies have been recently tested in clinical trials. Emerging evidence demonstrates that in response to mild energetic stress, mitochondria could orchestrate a robust adaptive stress response activating multiple neuroprotective mechanism. The objective of this review is to highlight recent development of mitochondria-targeting therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, mitochondria complex I inhibitors in particular.\n",

Moreover, the wide range of endpoints allows to make well-informed decisions for designing pivotal studies later.\n",
      "Age remains the largest risk factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous cellular hallmarks of aging contribute to the advancement of the pathologies associated with neurodegenerative disease. Not all cellular hallmarks of aging are independent and several fall into the broader category of cellular rejuvenation, which captures returning cells to a more youthful, improved functional state. Cellular rejuvenation is quickly becoming a hot topic in the development of novel therapeutic modalities for a range of diseases. Therapeutic approaches utilizing cellular rejuvenation technologies are rapidly advancing and will represent the next phase of AD therapeutics. This review focuses on two important processes, epigenetic reprogramming, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) that play a critical role in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential therapeutic approaches (gene therapy, small molecule) towards targeting these mechanisms. In aging and in AD, epigenetic changes on DNA (e.g., hypermethylation on CpG islands) lead to alterations in gene expression. Partial epigenetic reprogramming utilizes transcription factors to remove the epigenetic marks and to rejuvenate cells to a more youthful state. During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, CMA becomes impaired resulting in a buildup of proteins known to be associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. The protein buildups lead to aggregates that preclude proteostasis leading to cell toxicity. Small-molecule CMA activators restore proteostasis and limit toxicity enabling cellular rejuvenation.\n",
      "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is an early event in the development of Alzheimer's disease. It precedes extracellular deposition of amyloid-β in senile plaques and blood vessel walls, the intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau protein, microglial activation, and neuronal cell death. BBB disruption allows the coagulation protein fibrinogen to leak from the blood into the brain, where it is converted by thrombin cleavage into fibrin and deposits in the parenchyma and CNS vessels. Fibrinogen cleavage by thrombin exposes a cryptic epitope termed P2 which can bind CD11b and CD11c on microglia, macrophages and dendritic cells and trigger an inflammatory response toxic to neurons. Indeed, genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrates a causal role for fibrin in innate immune cell activation and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The P2 inflammatory epitope is spatially and compositionally distinct from the coagulation epitope on fibrin. Mouse monoclonal antibody 5B8, which targets the P2 epitope without interfering with the clotting process, has been shown to reduce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The selectivity and efficacy of this anti-human fibrin-P2 antibody in animal models supports the development of a monoclonal antibody drug targeting fibrin P2 for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. THN391 is a humanized, affinity-matured antibody which has a 100-fold greater affinity for fibrin P2 and improved development properties compared to the parental 5B8 antibody. It is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial.\n",
      "The recent FDA-approval for amyloid lowering therapies reflects an unwavering commitment from the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research community to identify treatments for this leading cause of dementia. The clinical benefits achieved by reducing amyloid, though modest, provide evidence that disease modification is possible. Expanding the same tenacity to interventions targeting upstream drivers of AD pathogenesis could significantly impact the disease course. Advanced age is the greatest risk factor for developing AD. Interventions targeting biological aging offer the possibility of disrupting a foundational cause of AD. Senescent cells accumulate with age and contribute to inflammation and age-related diseases like AD. Senolytic drugs that clear senescent cells improve healthy aging, halt AD disease progression in animal models and are undergoing clinical testing. This review explores the biology of aging, the role of senescent cells in AD pathology, and various senotherapeutic approaches such as senolytics, dampening the SASP (senescence associated secretory phenotype), senescence pathway inhibition, vaccines, and prodrugs. We highlight ongoing clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the most advanced senolytic approach, dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q), including an ongoing Phase II senolytic trial supported by the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF). Challenges in the field of senotherapy for AD, including target engagement and biomarker development, are addressed. Ultimately, this research pursuit may lead to an effective treatment for AD and provide the field with another disease-modifying therapy to be used, alone or in combination, with other emerging treatment options.\n",
      "Age is the most important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The acceptable age range for participation in AD clinical trials is 50 to 90, and this 40-year span incorporates enormous age-related change. Clinical trial participants tend to be younger and healthier than the general population. They are also younger than the general population of AD patients. Drug development from a geroscience perspective would take greater account of effects of aging on clinical trial outcomes. The AD clinical trial pipeline has diversified beyond the canonical targets of amyloid beta protein and tau. Many of these interventions apply to age-related disorders. Anti-inflammatory agents and bioenergetic and metabolic therapies are among the well represented classes in the pipeline and are applicable to AD and non-AD age-related conditions. Drug development strategies can be adjusted to better inform outcomes of trials regarding aged individuals. Inclusion of older individuals in the multiple ascending dose trials of Phase 1, use of geriatric-related clinical outcomes and biomarkers in Phase 2, and extension of these Phase 2 learnings to Phase 3 will result in a more comprehensive understanding of AD therapies and their relationship to aging. Clinical trials can employ a more comprehensive geriatric assessment approach and biomarkers more relevant to aging at baseline and as exploratory outcomes. Greater attention to the role of aging and its influence in AD clinical trials can result in better understanding of the generalizability of clinical trial findings to the older AD population.\n",
      "This review underscores recent advancements in the role of protein and amino acid nutrition on cognitive health. Given the escalating prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease, it is essential to understand nonpharmaceutical interventions that could potentially counteract their development and progression.\n",
      "Emerging research indicates that moderate protein intake may offer protective benefits against dementia. Studies also emphasize the importance of considering not just the quantity, but also the quality and source of dietary protein. The role of essential amino acids in nutrition is gaining attention in the field of cognitive health. Moreover, plasma-free amino acid concentrations, particularly branched-chain amino acids, are being explored as potential biomarkers for cognitive health and Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistic studies suggest that proteins and amino acids help maintain neuronal integrity, reduce inflammation, and support muscle retention, all essential factors for cognitive health.\n",
      "Recent findings emphasize the complex relationship between protein, amino acids, and cognitive health, highlighting the potential of dietary interventions in warding off neurodegenerative diseases. Given the observational nature of these findings, further interventional and longitudinal studies are needed to ascertain causality and elucidate the mechanisms involved.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease cortical tau pathology initiates in the layer II cell clusters of entorhinal cortex, but it is not known why these specific neurons are so vulnerable. Aging macaques exhibit the same qualitative pattern of tau pathology as humans, including initial pathology in layer II entorhinal cortex clusters, and thus can inform etiological factors driving selective vulnerability. Macaque data have already shown that susceptible neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex express a \"signature of flexibility\" near glutamate synapses on spines, where cAMP-PKA magnification of calcium signaling opens nearby potassium and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels to dynamically alter synapse strength. This process is regulated by PDE4A/D, mGluR3, and calbindin, to prevent toxic calcium actions; regulatory actions that are lost with age/inflammation, leading to tau phosphorylation. The current study examined whether a similar \"signature of flexibility\" expresses in layer II entorhinal cortex, investigating the localization of PDE4D, mGluR3, and HCN1 channels. Results showed a similar pattern to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with PDE4D and mGluR3 positioned to regulate internal calcium release near glutamate synapses, and HCN1 channels concentrated on spines. As layer II entorhinal cortex stellate cells do not express calbindin, even when young, they may be particularly vulnerable to magnified calcium actions and ensuing tau pathology.\n",
      "The Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum is a unique spectrum of cognitive impairment that typically involves the stages of subjective memory complaints (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), such as apathy, anxiety, stress, and depression, are highly common throughout the AD continuum. However, there is a dearth of research on how these NPS vary across the AD continuum, especially SMC. There is also disagreement on the effects of specific NPS on each stage of the AD continuum due to their collinearity with other NPS, cognitive decline, and environmental factors (e.g., stress). In this article, we conduct a novel perspective review of the scientific literature to understand the presence of NPS across the AD continuum. Specifically, we review the effects of apathy, depression, anxiety, and stress in AD, MCI, and SMC. We then build on this knowledge by proposing two theories of NPS' occurrence across the AD continuum. Consequently, we highlight the current landscape, limitations (e.g., differing operationalization), and contentions surrounding the NPS literature. We also outline theories that could clear up contention and inspire future NPS research.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurological disorder, affecting more than 50 million individuals worldwide and causing gradual but progressive cognitive decline. The rising cost of medical treatment is mostly attributable to AD. There are now mainly a few slightly symptomatic therapeutic options accessible. Although this is not the primary reason, the failure to develop effective treatments for AD is often attributed to the disease's complicated pathophysiology and the wide range of underlying ideas.\n",
      "Studies undertaken over the past decade have aimed to find novel methods of overcoming these barriers and effectively delivering drugs to the central nervous system. As a result, nanotechnology provides a promising alternative to the standard means of administering anti-amyloidosis drugs, enhancing expectations for a successful treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These therapeutic implications of using nanoparticle-based approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are discussed in this paper.\n",
      "Published articles from PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.org, and the Alzheimer Association reports were carefully examined to compile information on the various strategies for combating AD. That has been studied to summarize the recent advancements and clinical studies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Statistics is the study and manipulation of data, including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.\n",
      "The biology of the BBB and its processes of penetration must be carefully taken into account while creating DDSs. If we have a better grasp of the disease's mechanism, we might be able to overcome the shortcomings of current treatments for AD. Different DDSs show interesting properties for delivering medication tailored to the brain. This review paper examines the recent applications of DDSs in diverse domains. By selecting the best targeting vectors and optimizing the combination of carriers, multifunctionalized DDS may be produced, and these DDS have a significant impact on AD therapy potential. To develop DDSs with the best therapeutic efficacy and manageable side effects, experts from a variety of fields may need to contribute their efforts. Currently, the therapeutic use of nanotechnology-based DDSs appears to be a promising prospect for AD therapy, and as the pathophysiology of AD is better understood, this strategy will develop over time.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Early and accurate diagnosis of AD is crucial for implementing timely interventions and developing effective therapeutic strategies. Proteome-based biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for AD diagnosis and prognosis due to their ability to reflect disease-specific molecular alterations. There is of great significance for biomarkers in AD diagnosis and management. It emphasizes the limitations of existing diagnostic approaches and the need for reliable and accessible biomarkers. Proteomics, a field that comprehensively analyzes the entire protein complement of cells, tissues, or bio fluids, is presented as a powerful tool for identifying AD biomarkers. There is a diverse range of proteomic approaches employed in AD research, including mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and protein microarrays. The challenges associated with identifying reliable biomarkers, such as sample heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of the disease. There are well-known proteins implicated in AD pathogenesis, such as amyloid-beta peptides, tau protein, Apo lipoprotein E, and clusterin, as well as inflammatory markers and complement proteins. Validation and clinical utility of proteome-based biomarkers are addressing the challenges involved in validation studies and the diagnostic accuracy of these biomarkers. There is great potential in monitoring disease progression and response to treatment, thereby aiding in personalized medicine approaches for AD patients. There is a great role for bioinformatics and data analysis in proteomics for AD biomarker research and the importance of data preprocessing, statistical analysis, pathway analysis, and integration of multi-omics data for a comprehensive understanding of AD pathophysiology. In conclusion, proteome-based biomarkers hold great promise in the field of AD research. They provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms, aid in early diagnosis, and facilitate personalized treatment strategies. However, further research and validation studies are necessary to harness the full potential of proteome-based biomarkers in clinical practice.\n",
      "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a metabolic disease reaching pandemic levels worldwide. In parallel, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the two leading causes of dementia in an increasingly long-living Western society. Numerous epidemiological studies support the role of T2D as a risk factor for the development of dementia. However, few basic science studies have focused on the possible mechanisms involved in this relationship. On the other hand, this review of the literature also aims to explore the relationship between T2D, AD and VaD. The data found show that there are several alterations in the central nervous system that may be promoting the development of T2D. In addition, there are some mechanisms by which T2D may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD or VaD.\n",
      "Texture analysis may capture subtle changes in the gray matter more sensitively than volumetric analysis. We aimed to investigate the patterns of neurodegeneration in semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by comparing the temporal gray matter texture and volume between cognitively normal controls and older adults with svPPA and AD.\n",
      "We enrolled all participants from three university hospitals in Korea. We obtained T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and compared the gray matter texture and volume of regions of interest (ROIs) between the groups using analysis of variance with Bonferroni posthoc comparisons. We also developed models for classifying svPPA, AD and control groups using logistic regression analyses, and validated the models using receiver operator characteristics analysis.\n",
      "Compared to the AD group, the svPPA group showed lower volumes in five ROIs (bilateral temporal poles, and the left inferior, middle, and superior temporal cortices) and higher texture in these five ROIs and two additional ROIs (right inferior temporal and left entorhinal cortices). The performances of both texture- and volume-based models were good and comparable in classifying svPPA from normal cognition (mean area under the curve [AUC] = 0.914 for texture; mean AUC = 0.894 for volume). However, only the texture-based model achieved a good level of performance in classifying svPPA and AD (mean AUC = 0.775 for texture; mean AUC = 0.658 for volume).\n",

      "Growing evidence suggests that place of birth (PoB) and related circumstances may have long-lasting and multiplicative contributions to various later-life outcomes. However, the specific contributions to different domains of cognitive function in late life remain less understood. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which PoB contribute to a wide range of later-life cognitive outcomes.\n",
      "A nationally representative sample of Americans aged 65 and older (N=3,216) from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) was utilized. Cognitive outcomes were assessed in HCAP and linked to HRS state-level PoB data to explore the contribution of birthplace to later-life cognitive disparities. Regression-based Shapley decompositions were employed to quantify this contribution.\n",
      "PoB significantly contributed to all assessed cognitive outcomes including memory, executive function, language and fluency, visuospatial function, orientation, global cognitive performance, cognitive impairment and dementia. Geographic disparities in cognitive outcomes were evident, with individuals born in US southern states and foreign-born individuals performing worse than those born in other states. PoB overall accounted for 2.4-13.9% of the total variance in cognition after adjusting for age and sex. This contribution reduced by half when adjusting for a rich set of sociodemographic and health factors over the life course, but PoB still independently explained 2.0-7.1% of the total variance in cognition.\n",
      "PoB has lasting contributions to later-life cognitive health, with significant geographic disparities observed. Addressing these disparities requires promoting more equalized place-based policies, resources, and early-life environments to improve health equities over the life course.\n",
      "The association between snoring, a very common condition that increases with age, and dementia risk is controversial. Snoring is linked to obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiometabolic conditions, both of which are associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, snoring also increases with body mass index (BMI), which in late life is linked to lower dementia risk, possibly due to metabolic changes during prodromal dementia.\n",
      "The prospective cohort study used data from 450,027 UK Biobank participants with snoring measured at baseline (2006 - 2010), and followed up for dementia diagnosis (censored at 2022).

      "Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders through genetic studies. However, how genetic risk factors for these diseases are related to microglial gene expression, microglial function, and ultimately disease, is still largely unknown. Microglia change rapidly in response to alterations in their cellular environment, which is regulated through changes in transcriptional programs, which are as yet poorly understood. Here, we compared the effects of a set of inflammatory and restorative stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, resiquimod, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adenosine triphosphate, dexamethasone, and interleukin-4) on human microglial cells from 67 different donors (N = 398 samples) at the gene and transcript level. We show that microglia from different anatomical brain regions show distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. We observed a greater overlap between human stimulated microglia and human monocytes than with mouse microglia. We define specific microglial signatures across conditions which are highly relevant for a wide range of biological functions and complex human diseases.

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder with varied patient progression. We aim to test the hypothesis that AD patients can be categorized into subgroups based on differences in progression. We leveraged data from three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to develop a knowledge-guided, deep temporal clustering (KG-DTC) framework for AD subtyping. This model combined autoencoders for contextual information capture, k-means clustering for representation formation, and clinical outcome classification for clinical knowledge integration. The derived representations, encompassing demographics, APOE genotype, cognitive assessments, brain volumes, and biomarkers, were clustered using the Gaussian Mixture Model to identify AD subtypes. Our novel KG-DTC framework was developed using placebo data from 2,087 AD patients across three solanezumab clinical trials (EXPEDITION, EXPEDITION2, and EXPEDITION3), achieving high performance in outcome prediction and clustering. The KG-DTC model demonstrated superior clustering structures, especially when combined with k-means clustering loss. External validation with independent clinical trial data showed consistent clustering results, with a 0.33 silhouette score for three clusters. The model's stability was confirmed through a leave-one-out approach, with an average adjusted Rand Index around 0.945. Three distinct AD subtypes were identified, each exhibiting unique patterns of cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and amyloid beta levels. Notably, Subtype 3 (S3) showed rapid cognitive decline across multiple clinical measures (e.g., 0.64 in S1 vs. -1.06 in S2 vs. 15.09 in S3 of average ADAS total change score, p<.001). This innovative approach offers promising insights for understanding variability in treatment outcomes and personalizing AD treatment strategies.\n",
      "ApoE4 is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease. While apoE is primarily expressed by astrocytes, AD pathology including endosomal abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction first occurs in neurons. Lysosomes are poised at the convergence point between these features. We find that apoE4-expressing cells exhibit lysosomal alkalinization, reduced lysosomal proteolysis, and impaired mitophagy. To identify driving factors for this lysosomal dysfunction, we performed quantitative lysosomal proteome profiling. This revealed that apoE4 expression results in lysosomal depletion of Lgals3bp and accumulation of Tmed5 in both Neuro-2a cells and postmitotic human neurons. Modulating the expression of both proteins affected lysosomal function, with Tmed5 knockdown rescuing lysosomal alkalinization in apoE4 cells, and Lgals3bp knockdown causing lysosomal alkalinization and reduced lysosomal density in apoE3 cells. Taken together, our work reveals that apoE4 exerts gain-of-toxicity by alkalinizing the lysosomal lumen, pinpointing lysosomal Tmed5 accumulation and Lgals3bp depletion as apoE4-associated drivers for this phenotype.\n",
      "The actin cytoskeleton is a biosensor of cellular stress and a potential prognosticator of human disease. In particular, aberrant cytoskeletal structures such as cofilin-actin rods and stress granules formed in response to energetic and oxidative stress are closely linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS. Whether these cytoskeletal phenomena can be harnessed for the development of biosensors for cytoskeletal dysfunction and, by extension, neurodegenerative disease progression, remains an open question. In this work, we describe the design and development of an optogenetic iteration of profilin, an actin monomer binding protein with critical functions in cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that this optically activated profilin ('OptoProfilin') can act as an optically triggered biosensor of applied cellular stress in select immortalized cell lines. Notably, OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor, likely increasing its utility for experimentalists. While a large body of work closely links profilin activity with cellular stress and neurodegenerative disease, this, to our knowledge, is the first example of profilin as an optogenetic biosensor of stress-induced changes in the cytoskeleton.\n",
      "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world after Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosing PD is challenging as it evolved slowly, and its symptoms eventuate gradually. Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in speech may be utilized as an excellent biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD. In this study, we have proposed a Chirplet transform (CT) based novel approach for diagnosing PD using speech signals. We employed CT to get the time-frequency matrix (TFM) of each speech recording, and we extracted time-frequency based entropy (TFE) features from the TFM. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the TFE features reflect the changes in speech that occurs in the speech due to PD, hence can be used for classifying the PD and healthy control (HC) individuals. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using the vowels and words from the PC-GITA database. The genetic algorithm is utilized to select the optimum features subset, while a support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifiers are employed for classification. The TFE features outperform the breathiness and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features. The SVM classifier is most effective compared to other machine-learning classifiers. The highest classification accuracy rates of 98% and 99% are achieved using the vowel /a/ and word /atleta/, respectively. The results reveal that the proposed CT-based entropy features effectively diagnose PD using the speech of a person.\n",

      "Chronic exposure to stress throughout the lifespan has been the focus of many studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of the similarities between the biological mechanisms involved in chronic stress and the pathophysiology of AD. In fact, the earliest abnormality associated with the disease is the presence of phosphorylated tau protein in locus coeruleus neurons, a brain structure highly responsive to stress and perceived threat. Here, we introduce allostatic load as a useful concept for understanding many of the complex, interacting neuropathological changes involved in the AD degenerative process. In response to chronic stress, aberrant tau proteins that begin to accumulate within the locus coeruleus decades prior to symptom onset appear to represent a primary pathological event in the AD cascade, triggering a wide range of interacting brain changes involving neuronal excitotoxicity, endocrine alterations, inflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid plaque exacerbation. While it is acknowledged that stress will not necessarily be the major precipitating factor in all cases, early tau-induced changes within the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine pathway suggests that a therapeutic window might exist for preventative measures aimed at managing stress and restoring balance within the HPA axis.\n",
      "Home- and community-based services (HCBS) users, on average, experience hospitalizations more frequently than nursing facility residents. However, little is known about state-level variation in such adverse events among these groups. Using 2018 Medicare and Medicaid claims for dual-eligible beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, we described hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visit rates among HCBS users and nursing facility residents and observed substantial state-level variation. In addition, consistent with prior evidence, we found more frequent hospitalizations and ED visits among HCBS users than nursing facility residents. The magnitude of this difference varied considerably across states, and the degree of variation was greatest among beneficiaries with six or more comorbid conditions. Our findings represent a crucial initial exploration of the state-level variation in adverse events among HCBS users and nursing facility residents, paving the way for further investigations into factors that contribute to this variability.\n",

These regions harbour nearly 2000 potential novel genes with unknown function. In order to uncover candidate genes associated with human neurological pathologies, a comparative transcriptome study using the T2T-CHM13 and the GRCh38 genome assemblies was conducted on previously published datasets for eight distinct human neurological disorders.\n",
      "The analysis of differential expression in RNA sequencing data led to the identification of 336 novel candidate genes linked to human neurological disorders. Additionally, it was revealed that, on average, 3.6% of the differentially expressed genes detected with the GRCh38 assembly may represent potential false positives. Among the noteworthy findings, two novel genes were discovered, one encoding a pore-structured protein and the other a highly ordered β-strand-rich protein. These genes exhibited upregulation in multiple epilepsy datasets and hold promise as candidate genes potentially modulating the progression of the disease. Furthermore, an analysis of RNA derived from white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis patients indicated significant upregulation of 26 rRNA encoding genes.

The review explores neuroimaging findings related to hippocampal variants (incomplete hippocampal inversion, sulcal remnant and choroidal fissure cysts), and pathologies of neoplastic (astrocytoma and glioma, ganglioglioma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor, and metastasis), epileptic (mesial temporal sclerosis and focal cortical dysplasia), neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's disease, progressive primary aphasia, and frontotemporal dementia), infectious (Herpes simplex virus and limbic encephalitis), vascular (ischemic stroke, arteriovenous malformation, and cerebral cavernous malformations), and toxic-metabolic (transient global amnesia and opioid-associated amnestic syndrome) etiologies.\n",
      "Synaptosomes offer an intriguing ex vivo model system for investigating the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative processes. Lipoxygenases significantly affect the course of neurodegenerative diseases. Homeostasis of trace elements such as zinc is necessary for the continuity of brain functions. In this study, we purpose to determine whether LOXBlock-1, a 12/15 lipoxygenase inhibitor, and zinc sulfate (ZnSO\n",
      "Metabolomic epidemiology is the high-throughput study of the relationship between metabolites and health-related traits. This emerging and rapidly growing field has improved our understanding of disease aetiology and contributed to advances in precision medicine. As the field continues to develop, metabolomic epidemiology could lead to the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers predictive of disease risk, aiding in earlier disease detection and better prognosis. In this Review, we discuss key advances facilitated by the field of metabolomic epidemiology for a range of conditions, including cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19, with a focus on potential clinical utility. Core principles in metabolomic epidemiology, including study design, causal inference methods and multi-omic integration, are briefly discussed. Future directions required for clinical translation of metabolomic epidemiology findings are summarized, emphasizing public health implications. Further work is needed to establish which metabolites reproducibly improve clinical risk prediction in diverse populations and are causally related to disease progression.\n",
      "The selective inhibition of kinases from the diabetic kinome is known to promote the regeneration of beta cells and provide an opportunity for the curative treatment of diabetes. The effect can be achieved by carefully tailoring the selectivity of inhibitor toward a particular kinase, especially DYRK1A, previously associated with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Recently DYRK1A inhibition has been shown to promote both insulin secretion and beta cells proliferation. Here, we show that commonly available flavones are effective inhibitors of DYRK1A. The observed biochemical activity of flavone compounds is confirmed by crystal structures solved at 2.06 Å and 2.32 Å resolution, deciphering the way inhibitors bind in the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase, which is driven by the arrangement of hydroxyl moieties. We also demonstrate antidiabetic properties of these biomolecules and prove that they could be further improved by therapy combined with TGF-β inhibitors. Our data will allow future structure-based optimization of the presented scaffolds toward potent, bioavailable and selective anti-diabetic drugs.\n",
      "This study determined the occurrence of cognitive impairment and mood disorders in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors with good neurologic outcomes. We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study with a total of 97 patients. We evaluated cognitive dysfunction via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Alzheimer's disease-8 mood disorders via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We measured quality of life with the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Levels questionnaire. Cognitive impairment and mood disorders were common among patients with good neurologic recovery. There were 23 patients who experienced cognitive impairments (23.7%) and 28 who suffered from mood disorders (28.9%). Age (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12), mood disorders (adjusted OR 22.80, 95% CI 4.84-107.49) and hospital length of stay (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09) were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment. The occurrence of cognitive impairments (adjusted OR 9.94, 95% CI 2.83-35.97) and non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 11.51, 95% CI 3.15-42.15) were risk factors for mood disorders. Quality of life was significantly lower in the OHCA survivors with each disorder than the healthy individuals. Routine screening and intervention are needed for OHCA survivors.\n",
      "Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has emerged as a means of synchronizing circadian rhythms, which are commonly disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whittaker et al. demonstrate that TRF exerts protective effects in two mouse models of AD. We discuss the effects of TRF on brain health and mechanisms linking TRF to neurodegeneration.\n",
      "Active RA has been associated with an increased risk of both cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease. We aimed to compare cerebrovascular changes in patients with and without RA, both with and without a neuropathologic diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease.\n",
      "Patients with RA (n = 32) who died and underwent autopsy between 1994 and 2021 were matched to non-RA controls (n = 32) on age, sex and level of neurodegenerative proteinopathy. Routine neuropathologic examination was performed at the time of autopsy. Cerebrovascular disease severity was evaluated using modified Kalaria and Strozyk scales. Clinical dementia diagnoses were manually collected from patients' medical records.\n",
      "Prior to death, 15 (47%) RA patients and 14 (44%) controls were diagnosed with dementia; 9 patients in each group (60% and 64%, respectively) had Alzheimer's disease. The prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microinfarcts, infarcts or strokes was found to be similar between groups. Patients with RA were more likely to have more severe vascular changes in the basal ganglia by Kalaria scale (P = 0.04), but not in other brain areas. There were no significant differences in the presence of large infarcts, lacunar infarcts or leukoencephalopathy by Strozyk scale. Among patients with RA and no clinical diagnosis of dementia, the majority had mild-moderate cerebrovascular abnormalities, and a subset of patients had Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes.\n",
      "In this small series of autopsies, patients with and without RA had largely similar cerebrovascular pathology when controlling for neurodegenerative proteinopathies, although patients with RA exhibited more pronounced cerebrovascular disease in the basal ganglia.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia and is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration leading to severe cognitive, memory, and behavioral impairments. The onset of AD involves a complex interplay among various factors, including age, genetics, chronic inflammation, and impaired energy metabolism. Despite significant efforts, there are currently no effective therapies capable of modifying the course of AD, likely owing to an excessive focus on the amyloid hypothesis and a limited consideration of other intracellular pathways. In the present review, we emphasize the emerging concept of AD as a metabolic disease, where alterations in energy metabolism play a critical role in its development and progression. Notably, glucose metabolism impairment is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, Ca\n",
      "Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) subsists in all living organisms and has drawn tremendous attention as a nutraceutical and pharmaceutical product for several diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, aging, and vascular dysfunction. Here, NMN was produced intracellularly in a high cell density bioreactor using an engineered Escherichiacoli strain via exponential feeding of co-substrates. Fed-batch culture via exponential feeding of co-substrate (glucose) and continuous feeding of substrate (nicotinamide) were performed using different cumulative nicotinamide concentrations. The highest concentration of 19.3 g/L NMN with a dry cell weight of 117 g/L was acquired from a cumulative nicotinamide concentration of 7.2 g/L with a conversion of 98 % from nicotinamide in 28 h. Further, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis validated the NMN production. This approach will be beneficial in achieving simultaneously low cost and ensuring high quality and quantity of NMN production.\n",
      "Information processed in our sensory neocortical areas is transported to the hippocampus during memory encoding, and between hippocampus and neocortex during memory consolidation, and retrieval. Short bursts of high-frequency oscillations, so called sharp-wave-ripples, have been proposed as a potential mechanism for this information transfer: They can synchronize neural activity to support the formation of local neural networks to store information, and between distant cortical sites to act as a bridge to transfer information between sensory cortical areas and hippocampus. In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease, different neuropathological processes impair normal neural functioning and neural synchronization as well as sharp-wave-ripples, which impairs consolidation and retrieval of information, and compromises memory. Here, we formulate a new hypothesis, that artificially inducing sharp-wave-ripples with noninvasive high-frequency visual stimulation could potentially support memory functioning, as well as target the neuropathological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases. We also outline key challenges for empirical tests of the hypothesis.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurological disorders and, researchers believe that the impairment of oxidant-antioxidant system plays an important role in its progression. The PI3K/NRF2 pathway has particular importance in increasing the expression of antioxidants. Thus present study aimed to investigate the effect of eight weeks of aerobic training (AT) with vitamin C (VC) on the expression pathway of antioxidants in the hippocampus tissue of trimethyltin chloride (TMT) induced Alzheimer's Disease Rats.\n",
      "In this experimental study, 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats (age 14-16 months, weight 270-320 g) were injected 10 mg/kg TMT and were divided into (1) TMT (n = 7), (2) TMT + VC (n = 7), (3) TMT + AT (n = 7) and (4) TMT + VC + AT (n = 7) groups. Also, 7 healthy rats without any intervention selected as healthy control (HC) group to investigate the effects of TMT on research variables. Groups 3 and 4 ran on the treadmill for eight weeks, for 15-48 min at a speed of 10-24 m/min. Also, groups 2 and 4 received 4 mg/kg VC orally. To measure PI3K, Nrf2, SOD and catalase in the hippocampus tissue of rats, ELISA method were used. To analyze the data, one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post- hoc tests were used (P ≤ 0.05).\n",
      "The hippocampal values of Nrf2 and SOD in TMT + VC, TMT + AT and TMT + VC + AT groups were higher than TMT group (P = 0.001). Catalase in TMT + AT and TMT + VC + AT groups was higher than TMT group (P = 0.001). Also, catalase and PI3K were higher in the TMT + VC + AT group than the TMT + VC group (P = 0.05). PI3K levels of TMT + VC + AT group were higher than TMT + AT group (P = 0.02).\n",
      "It seems that AT and VC, both alone and in combination, play a role in improving the transcription pathway of antioxidants in the hippocampus tissue of TMT induced Alzheimer's disease Rats. Therefore, the combination of these two interventions is suggested to improve the antioxidant system.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) share common features, including insulin resistance. Brain insulin resistance has been implicated as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-diabetic drugs sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2-i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4-i) improve insulin sensitivity and provide neuroprotection. However, the effects of these two inhibitors on the brain metabolism and insulin resistance remain uninvestigated. We developed a T2D-AD mouse model using a high-fat diet (HFD) for 19 weeks along with a single dose of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at the fourth week of HFD initiation. Subsequently, the animals were treated with SGLT2-i (empagliflozin, 25 mg/kg/day orally [p.o.]) and DPP4-i (sitagliptin, 100 mg/kg/day p.o.) for 7 weeks. Subsequently, behavioral tests were performed, and the expression of insulin signaling, AD-related, and other signaling pathway proteins in the brain were examined. T2D-AD mice not only showed increased blood glucose levels and body weight but also insulin resistance. SGLT2-i and DPP4-i effectively ameliorated insulin sensitivity and reduced body weight in these mice. Furthermore, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i significantly improved hippocampal-dependent learning, memory, and cognitive functions in the T2D-AD mouse model. Interestingly, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i reduced the hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) levels and amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation and enhanced brain insulin signaling. SGLT2-i reduced pTau accumulation through the angiotensin converting enzyme-2/angiotensin (1-7)/ mitochondrial assembly receptor axis, whereas DPP4-i reduced Aβ accumulation by increasing insulin-degrading enzyme levels. These findings suggest that SGLT2-i and DPP4-i prevent AD-like pathology and cognitive dysfunction in T2D mice potentially through affecting brain insulin signaling via different mechanisms.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease is a fatal, incurable, chronic neurodegenerative disease. Diagnosis in its early and even preclinical stages will be beneficial for its prevention and treatment. In the accepted pathological theory, abnormal accumulation of Aβ protein and abnormal mitochondrial function, including changes in mitochondrial viscosity, is closely related to Alzheimer's disease. To date, rare fluorescent probes have been reported that can simultaneously image Aβ plaques and mitochondrial viscosity. Therefore, the development of a dual-functional fluorescent probe for real-time fluorescence imaging of Aβ plaques and mitochondrial viscosity is crucial to discover a novel approach and strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and to understand the pathological process and crosstalk between different biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of fluorescent probes QM-SF-1∼5 with dimethylamino-quinolinium as the skeleton and thiophene as the π bridge to connect the groups with different electron-push/pull capacities. Among them, QM-SF-2 exhibited excellent properties such as large Stokes shift (168 nm), near-infrared emission (689 nm), and high selectivity and sensitivity (limit of detection was 1.07 μM) to Aβ aggregate and mitochondrial viscosity changes, indicating its promising prospects as a dual-functional imaging tool in the pathological study of Alzheimer's disease.\n",

      "Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are potent triggers of innate immune responses upon recognition by cytosolic dsRNA sensor proteins. Identification of endogenous dsRNAs helps to better understand the dsRNAome and its relevance to innate immunity related to human diseases.\n",
      "Here, we report dsRID (double-stranded RNA identifier), a machine-learning-based method to predict dsRNA regions in silico, leveraging the power of long-read RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and molecular traits of dsRNAs. Using models trained with PacBio long-read RNA-seq data derived from Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, we show that our approach is highly accurate in predicting dsRNA regions in multiple datasets. Applied to an AD cohort sequenced by the ENCODE consortium, we characterize the global dsRNA profile with potentially distinct expression patterns between AD and controls. Together, we show that dsRID provides an effective approach to capture global dsRNA profiles using long-read RNA-seq data.\n",

      "People with dementia from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds often face poor health and social outcomes such as stigma, depression, and reduced help seeking behaviours. Dementia friendly communities have been shown to reduce stigma, and the gap in health and social outcomes for people impacted by dementia. Despite the large presence of established dementia friendly communities, their functioning in multicultural communities remains underexplored. The aim of this review was to identify the barriers and facilitators of cultural inclusivity to inform the development of a multicultural dementia friendly community. We systematically searched for academic and grey literature regarding existing and prospective age or dementia-friendly communities that engaged with culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Using the matrix method, data on the barriers and facilitators to engagement were extracted. Papers were analysed for common themes and findings were integrated in a narrative format. A total of 3,164 papers were identified, 11 of which met inclusion criteria. There were 6 dementia friendly communities in North America, 3 in Europe, 1 in Australia and 1 in Asia. Analyses revealed that barriers to cultural inclusivity were centered around the accessibility of services, sociocultural factors, and the environment, including issues such as low awareness of dementia and stigma, language barriers, isolation, and the inaccessibility of transport and buildings. Leveraging existing cultural leaders and social structures to target culturally and linguistically diverse populations and develop tailored dementia friendly initiatives were key facilitators. To foster cultural inclusivity in dementia friendly communities, a culturally specific lens that addresses these barriers and utilises facilitators must be applied from the design stage through to implementation and evaluation.\n",
      "Episodic memory decline is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and linked to deficits in episodic thinking directed to the future. We addressed the question whether a deficit in episodic thinking can be picked up directly from connected speech and its detection can be automatized.\n",
      "We linguistically classified 2,809 utterances (including embedded clauses in the utterances) from picture descriptions from 70 healthy older controls, 82 people with mild probable AD (pAD), and 46 people with moderate pAD for whether they were episodic, nonepisodic, or \"other\" (e.g., off-task). Generalized linear regression models were used to investigate how ratios of these categories change in AD, controlling for age, gender, and education. Finally, we applied deep learning technique to explore the feasibility of automating the episodicity analysis.\n",
      "Decline in episodicity significantly distinguished controls from both mild pAD and moderate pAD. Correlation analysis suggested this decline not to be an effect of age, gender, and education but of cognitive ability. The decline was not compensated by an increase of nonepisodic utterances but mainly of off-task expressions. A transformer-based classifier to explore the possibility of automatizing the classification of episodicity achieved a macro F1 score of 0.913 in the ternary classification.\n",
      "These results show that a loss of episodicity is an early effect in AD that is manifested in spontaneous speech and can be reliably measured by both humans and machines.\n",
      "Incidence and mortality rates of gastrointestinal (GI) and oral cancers are among the highest in the world, compared to other cancers. GI cancers include esophageal, gastric, colon, rectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers, with colorectal cancer being the most common. Oral cancer, which is included in the head and neck cancers category, is one of the most important causes of death in India. Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic element affecting humans and the environment, which has both natural and anthropogenic sources. Generally, water, soil, air, and food supplies are reported as some sources of Cd. It accumulates in organs, particularly in the kidneys and liver. Exposure to cadmium is associated with different types of health risks such as kidney dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, reproductive dysfunction, diabetes, cerebral infarction, and neurotoxic effects (Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)). Exposure to Cd is also associated with various cancers, including lung, kidney, liver, stomach, hematopoietic system, gynecologic and breast cancer. In the present study, we have provided and summarized the association of Cd exposure with oral and GI cancers.\n",
      "Thyroid hormone is among the most common prescriptions in the US and up to 20% may be overtreated. Endogenous hyperthyroidism may be a risk factor for dementia, but data are limited for iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis.\n",
      "To determine whether thyrotoxicosis, both endogenous and exogenous, is associated with increased risk of cognitive disorders.\n",
      "This cohort study performed a longitudinal time-varying analysis of electronic health records for patients receiving primary care in the Johns Hopkins Community Physicians Network between January 1, 2014, and May 6, 2023. Patients 65 years and older with at least 2 visits 30 days apart to their primary care physicians were eligible. None of the 65 931 included patients had a history of low thyrotropin (TSH) level or cognitive disorder diagnoses within 6 months of their first visit. Data analysis was performed from January 1 through August 5, 2023.\n",
      "The exposure variable was a low TSH level, characterized based on the clinical context as due to endogenous thyrotoxicosis, exogenous thyrotoxicosis, or unknown cause, excluding those attributable to acute illness or other medical factors such as medications.\n",
      "The outcome measure was cognitive disorders, including mild cognitive impairment and all-cause dementia, to improve sensitivity and account for the underdiagnosis of dementia in primary care.\n",
      "A total of 65 931 patients were included in the analysis (median [IQR] age at first visit, 68.0 [65.0-74.0] years; 37 208 [56%] were female; 46 106 [69.9%] were White). Patients exposed to thyrotoxicosis had cognitive disorder incidence of 11.0% (95% CI, 8.4%-14.2%) by age 75 years vs 6.4% (95% CI, 6.0%-6.8%) for those not exposed. After adjustment, all-cause thyrotoxicosis was significantly associated with risk of cognitive disorder diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.18-1.64; P < .001) across age groups. When stratified by cause and severity, exogenous thyrotoxicosis remained a significant risk factor (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.10-1.63; P = .003) with point estimates suggestive of a dose response.\n",
      "In this cohort study among patients 65 years and older, a low TSH level from either endogenous or exogenous thyrotoxicosis was associated with higher risk of incident cognitive disorder. Iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis is a common result of thyroid hormone therapy. With thyroid hormone among the most common prescriptions in the US, understanding the negative effects of overtreatment is critical to help guide prescribing practice.\n",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose significant challenges to public health globally with no effective treatment strategies available. Therefore, the research focuses on developing effective prophylaxis to prevent the onset of these diseases. Recent studies have suggested that low-dose aspirin may help reduce the risk of dementia. Nonetheless, evidence regarding the correlation between aspirin consumption and the onset of dementia and AD is limited. This review aims to provide an up-to-date summary of the existing evidence and evaluate the association between aspirin and the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases was conducted to find eligible studies published until April 2023. A random-effects meta-analysis of the eligible studies was then performed to assess the link between aspirin use and the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, we conducted subgroup analyses to evaluate the overall effect of low-dose (75-100 mg) aspirin consumption on the onset of dementia and AD.\n",
      "A total of 875 studies were identified, with only 22 meeting the inclusion criteria. There was no statistically significant impact of aspirin consumption on the onset of dementia (HR 1.13, 11 studies) or Alzheimer's disease (HR 0.91, 3 studies). Additionally, subgroup analysis showed that taking low doses of aspirin (75-100 mg) did not significantly affect the onset of either dementia (HR 0.96, 13 studies) or Alzheimer's disease (HR 0.85, 2 studies).\n",
      "Aspirin use does not decrease the risk of dementia or AD, even when taken in low doses. However, the quality of the studies analyzed was inadequate, with only three randomized controlled trials included in the review. Future high-quality studies are needed to assess the effect of aspirin consumption on these diseases. These findings may assist clinicians in selecting appropriate prophylactic strategies for patients at risk of developing dementia and AD.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive abilities. A pathological hallmark of AD is a region-specific accumulation of the amyloid-beta protein (Aβ). Here, we explored the association between regional Aβ deposition, sociodemographic, and local biochemical factors. We quantified the Aβ burden in postmortem cortical samples from parietal (PCx) and temporal (TCx) regions of 27 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 15 AD donors, aged 78-100 + years. Histological images of Aβ immunohistochemistry and local concentrations of pathological and inflammatory proteins were obtained at the \"Aging, Dementia and TBI Study\" open database. We used the area fraction fractionator stereological methodology to quantify the Aβ burden in the gray and white matter within each cortical region. We found higher Aβ burdens in the TCx of AD octogenarians compared to CU ones. We also found higher Aβ loads in the PCx of AD nonagenarians than in AD octogenarians. Moreover, AD women exhibited increased Aβ deposition compared to CU women. Interestingly, we observed a negative correlation between education years and Aβ burden in the white matter of both cortices in CU samples. In AD brains, the Aβ40, Aβ42, and pTau181 isoforms of Aβ and Tau proteins were positively correlated with the Aβ burden. Additionally, in the TCx of AD donors, the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα showed a positive correlation with the Aβ load. These novel findings contribute to understanding the interplay between sociodemographic characteristics, local inflammatory signaling, and the development of AD-related pathology in the cerebral cortex.\n",

      "The prevalence of OSA is as high as 75% in patients with T21. We sought to examine the cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrinological outcomes of patients with T21 10 years after their diagnosis of OSA.\n",
      "TriNetX, an electronic medical record database, was queried for health outcomes in patients with T21 after diagnosis of OSA. The group was further analyzed to identify those who underwent sleep surgery, including hypoglossal nerve stimulation, palatopharyngoplasty, or adenotonsillectomy.\n",
      "Ten years after diagnosis, patients with OSA and T21 had a significantly higher incidence of death, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, essential hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer's disease compared to patients with T21 alone. Patients with OSA and T21 who underwent sleep surgery had significantly reduced incidence of adverse health outcomes compared to patients using continuous positive airway pressure.\n",
      "Our findings suggest that patients with T21 and OSA are at higher risk of poor health outcomes, which may require closer monitoring for earlier diagnosis and management of comorbid conditions. Sleep surgery is a suitable treatment modality for mitigating the risk of adverse outcomes in this population and should be considered in patients who are eligible surgical candidates.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Recent development in sciences has also identified the pivotal role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in AD pathogenesis.\n",
      "We proposed a novel method to identify AD pathway-specific statistically significant miRNAs from the targets of known AD drugs. Moreover, microRNA scaffolds and corresponding drug scaffolds of different pathways were also discovered.\n",
      "A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to identify pathway-specific significant miRNAs. We generated feed-forward loop regulations of microRNA-TF-gene-based networks, studied the minimum free energy structures of pre-microRNA sequences, and clustered those microRNAs with their corresponding structural motifs of robust transcription factors. Conservation analyses of significant microRNAs were done, and the phylogenetic trees were constructed. We identified 3'UTR binding sites and chromosome locations of these significant microRNAs.\n",
      "In this study, hsa-miR-4261, hsa-miR-153-5p, hsa-miR-6766, and hsa-miR-4319 were identified as key miRNAs for the ACHE pathway and hsa-miR-326, hsa-miR-6133, hsa-miR-4251, hsa-miR-3148, hsa-miR-10527-5p, hsa-miR-527, and hsa-miR-518a were identified as regulatory miRNAs for the NMDA pathway. These miRNAs were regulated by several AD-specific TFs, namely RAD21, FOXA1, and ESR1. It has been observed that anisole and adamantane are important chemical scaffolds to regulate these significant miRNAs.\n",
      "This is the first study that developed a detailed correlation between known AD drug scaffolds and their AD target-specific miRNA scaffolds. This study identified chromosomal locations of microRNAs and corresponding structural scaffolds of transcription factors that may be responsible for miRNA co-regulation for Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides hope for therapeutic improvements in the existing microRNAs by regulating pathways and targets.\n",
      "The interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation is implicated in many chronic diseases including Alzheimer`s disease, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. Thirteen β-hydroxy-β-arylalkanoic acids were previously synthesized and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity. The aim of this study was to asses ex vivo antioxidant activity of synthesized acids, as well as ibuprofen and to identify the compounds with the most promising results for further investigation on their capacity to counteract in vivo oxidative stress triggered by inflammation. The antioxidant potential of tested compounds was evaluated by determining the concentrations of total antioxidative status, total oxidative status, prooxidant antioxidant balance and the total sulfhydryl groups. Z score statistics were used to calculate the summary scores for antioxidative activity, prooxidative activity and oxy score. The tested compounds and ibuprofen demonstrated mild prooxidative activity ex vivo. Seven acids with substituents on one benzene ring exhibited better results than ibuprofen and were selected for in vivo testing. In vivo results demonstrated better antioxidant protection compared to ex vivo results. Compound g which contains nitro group on the benzene ring demonstrated the lowest oxy score, and four compounds exhibited better results than ibuprofen.\n",
      "Abnormal orthostatic blood pressure (BP) regulation may result in cerebral hypoperfusion and brain ischemia and contribute to dementia. It may also manifest as early symptoms of the neurodegenerative process associated with dementia. The relationship between the magnitude and timing of orthostatic BP responses and dementia risk is not fully understood.\n",
      "We conducted a prospective cohort analysis of the associations of orthostatic BP changes and self-reported orthostatic dizziness with the risk of dementia in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC). We calculated changes in BP from the supine to the standing position at 5 measurements taken within 2 minutes after standing during the baseline visit (1987-1989). The primary outcome was adjudicated dementia ascertained through 2019.\n",
      "Among 11 644 participants (mean [SD] age, 54.5 [5.7] years; 54.1% women; 25.9% Black), 2303 dementia cases were identified during a median follow-up of 25.9 years. Large decreases in systolic BP from the supine to standing position measured at the first 2 measurements ≈30 and 50 seconds after standing, but not afterward, were associated with orthostatic dizziness and a higher risk of dementia. Comparing a decrease in systolic BP of ≤-20 or >-20 to -10 mm Hg to stable systolic BP (>-10 to 10 mm Hg) at the first measurement, the adjusted hazard ratios were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01-1.47) and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.97-1.25), respectively.\n",
      "Abnormal orthostatic BP regulation, especially abrupt drops in BP within the first minute, might be early risk markers for the development of dementia. Transient early orthostatic hypotension warrants more attention in clinical settings.\n",

      "A key role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been identified over the past decades. Increasing clinical and preclinical evidence implicates that there is bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), which is also known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Nevertheless, current knowledge on the interplay between gut microbiota and the brain remains largely unclear. One of the primary mediating factors by which the gut microbiota interacts with the host is peripheral metabolites, including blood or gut-derived metabolites. However, mechanistic knowledge about the effect of the microbiome and metabolome signaling on the brain is limited. Neuroimaging techniques, such as multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have the potential to directly elucidate brain structural and functional changes corresponding with alterations of the gut microbiota and peripheral metabolites \n",
      "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is defined as self-experienced, persistent concerns of decline in cognitive capacity in the context of normal performance on objective cognitive measures. Although SCD was initially thought to represent the \"worried well,\" these concerns can be linked to subtle brain changes prior to changes in objective cognitive performance and, therefore, in some individuals, SCD may represent the early stages of an underlying neurodegenerative disease process (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). The field of SCD research has expanded rapidly over the years, and this review aims to provide an update on new advances in, and contributions to, the field of SCD in key areas and themes identified by researchers in this field as particularly important and impactful. First, we highlight recent studies examining sociodemographic and genetic risk factors for SCD, including explorations of SCD across racial and ethnic minoritized groups, and examinations of sex and gender considerations. Next, we review new findings on relationships between SCD and in vivo markers of pathophysiology, utilizing neuroimaging and biofluid data, as well as associations between SCD and objective cognitive tests and neuropsychiatric measures. Finally, we summarize recent work on interventions for SCD and areas of future growth in the field of SCD.\n",

Freezing of gait, reduced gait speed, and a prior history of falls are risk factors for falls in PD and should be incorporated in assessments to identify fall risk and target interventions. Multimodal and multi-domain fall prevention interventions may be beneficial. With advanced or complex PD, balance and strength training should be administered under supervision. Medications, particularly cholinesterase inhibitors, show promise for falls prevention. Identifying how to engage people with PD, their families, and health professionals in falls education and implementation remains a challenge. Barriers to the prevention of falls occur at individual, environmental, policy, and health system levels.\n",

      "To diagnose and predict the possibility of Alzheimer's or a different kind of dementia, medical professionals employ tests that look at a patient's mental competence; however, such methods are impracticable. A reliable diagnosis at the start of treatment is essential for therapy. Except in situations with apparent genetic variations, most Alzheimer's patients lack a known etiology. Therefore, every Alzheimer's patient receives the same treatment plan, regardless of the etiology, which may or may not be successful in slowing or preventing the disease's progression. Tau pathology is further complicated by the amyloid buildup that arises from the cellular phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alzheimer's is a degenerative, diverse, complicated, and incurable neurological disorder primarily affecting elderly individuals.

Exploring the structure and communication mode of MGB axis is crucial for understanding its role in diseases, and studying the signaling pathways and regulatory methods of MGB axis regulation in diseases is also of profound significance for future clinical research. This article reviews the composition, communication mechanism of MGB axis and its role in inflammatory and infective diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), depression, psoriasis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In addition, our investigation delved into the regulatory functions of the inflammasome, IFN-I, NF-κB, and PARK7/DJ-1 innate immune signaling pathway in the context of inflammatory and infective diseases. Ultimately, we discussed the efficacy of various interventions, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics, in the management of inflammatory and infective diseases. Understanding the role and mechanism of the MGB axis might make positive effects in the treatment of inflammatory and infective diseases.\n",
      "Each human genome has tens of thousands of rare genetic variants; however, identifying impactful rare variants remains a major challenge. We demonstrate how use of personal multi-omics can enable identification of impactful rare variants by using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, which included several hundred individuals, with whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomes, methylomes, and proteomes collected across two time points, 10 years apart. We evaluated each multi-omics phenotype's ability to separately and jointly inform functional rare variation. By combining expression and protein data, we observed rare stop variants 62 times and rare frameshift variants 216 times as frequently as controls, compared to 13-27 times as frequently for expression or protein effects alone. We extended a Bayesian hierarchical model, \"Watershed,\" to prioritize specific rare variants underlying multi-omics signals across the regulatory cascade. With this approach, we identified rare variants that exhibited large effect sizes on multiple complex traits including height, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that impairs neurocognitive function. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) are the two main proteins implicated in AD. Indeed, the major available commercial drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) against Alzheimer's are AChE inhibitors. However, none of these drugs are known to reverse or reduce the pathophysiological condition of the disease since there are multiple contributing factors to AD. Therefore, there is a need to develop a multitarget-directed ligand approach for its treatment. In the present study, plant bioactive compounds were screened for their AChE and BACE1 inhibition potential by conducting molecular docking studies. Considering their docking score and pharmacokinetic properties, limonin, peimisine, serratanine B, and withanolide A were selected as the lead compounds. Molecular dynamics simulations of these protein-ligand complexes confirmed the conformational and energetically stabilized enzyme-inhibitor complexes.

      "Sphingolipids, as members of the large lipid family, are important components of plasma membrane. Sphingolipids participate in biological signal transduction to regulate various important physiological processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that sphingolipids are strongly associated with glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, including peripheral insulin resistance and brain insulin resistance, is closely related to the occurrence and development of many metabolic diseases. In addition to metabolic diseases, like type 2 diabetes, brain insulin resistance is also involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the specific mechanism of sphingolipids in brain insulin resistance has not been systematically summarized. This article reviews the involvement of sphingolipids in brain insulin resistance, highlighting the role and molecular biological mechanism of sphingolipid metabolism in cognitive dysfunctions and neuropathological abnormalities of the brain.\n",
      "Carriers of mutations responsible for dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease provide a unique opportunity to study potential imaging biomarkers. Biomarkers based on routinely acquired clinical MR images, could supplement the extant invasive or logistically challenging) biomarker studies. We used 1104 longitudinal MR, 324 amyloid beta, and 87 tau positron emission tomography imaging sessions from 525 participants enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Observational Study to extract novel imaging metrics representing the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of standardized image intensities of T1-weighted and Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR scans. There was an exponential decrease in FLAIR-μ in mutation carriers and an increase in FLAIR and T1 signal heterogeneity (T1-σ and FLAIR-σ) as participants approached the symptom onset in both supramarginal, the right postcentral and right superior temporal gyri as well as both caudate nuclei, putamina, thalami, and amygdalae. After controlling for the effect of regional atrophy, FLAIR-μ decreased and T1-σ and FLAIR-σ increased with increasing amyloid beta and tau deposition in numerous cortical regions. In symptomatic mutation carriers and independent of the effect of regional atrophy, tau pathology demonstrated a stronger relationship with image intensity metrics, compared with amyloid pathology. We propose novel MR imaging intensity-based metrics using standard clinical T1 and FLAIR images which strongly associates with the progression of pathology in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease. We suggest that tau pathology may be a key driver of the observed changes in this cohort of patients.\n",
      "Personality change in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is complicated by the patient and informant factors that confound accurate reporting of personality traits. We assessed the impact of caregiver burden on informant report of Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness) and investigated the regional cortical volumes associated with larger discrepancies in the patient and informant report of the Big Five personality traits.\n",
      "Sixty-four ADRD participants with heterogeneous neurodegenerative clinical phenotypes and their informants completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Caregiver burden was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview. Discrepancy scores were computed as the difference between patient and informant ratings for the BFI. Regional gray matter volumes from T1-weighted 3T MRI were normalized to intracranial volume and related to global Big Five discrepancy scores using linear regression.\n",
      "Higher levels of caregiver burden were associated with higher informant ratings of patient neuroticism (ß = 0.08, p = .012) and with lower informant ratings of patient agreeableness (ß = 0.11, p = .021) and conscientiousness (ß = 0.04, p = .034) independent of disease severity. Patients with greater Big Five discrepancy scores showed smaller cortical volumes in the right medial prefrontal cortex (β = -5.24, p = .045) and right superior temporal gyrus (β = -7.91, p = .028).\n",
      "Informant ratings of personality traits in ADRD can be confounded by the caregiver burden, highlighting the need for more objective measures of personality and behavior in dementia samples.

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the predominant impairment of neurons in the hippocampus and the formation of amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The overexpression of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) in an AD brain results in the binding of APP intracellular domain (AICD) to Fe65 protein via the C-terminal Fe65-PTB2 interaction, which then triggers the secretion of amyloid-β and the consequent pathogenesis of AD. Apparently, targeting the interaction between APP and Fe65 can offer a promising therapeutic approach for AD. Recently, exosome, a type of extracellular vesicle with diameter around 30-200 nm, has gained much attention as a potential delivery tool for brain diseases, including AD, due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, their efficient uptake by autologous cells, and their ability to be surface-modified with target-specific receptor ligands. Here, the engineering of hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes to overexpress Fe65, enabled the development of a novel exosome-based targeted drug delivery system, which carried Corynoxine-B (Cory-B, an autophagy inducer) to the APP overexpressed-neuron cells in the brain of AD mice. The Fe65-engineered HT22 hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes (Fe65-EXO) loaded with Cory-B (Fe65-EXO-Cory-B) hijacked the signaling and blocked the natural interaction between Fe65 and APP, enabling APP-targeted delivery of Cory-B. Notably, Fe65-EXO-Cory-B induced autophagy in APP-expressing neuronal cells, leading to amelioration of the cognitive decline and pathogenesis in AD mice, demonstrating the potential of Fe65-EXO-Cory-B as an effective therapeutic intervention for AD.\n",

      "At present, the etiology and pathogenesis of most neurodegenerative diseases are still not fully understood, which poses challenges for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these diseases. Sleep disorders are one of the common chief complaints of neurodegenerative diseases. When patients suffer from comorbid sleep disorder and neurodegenerative diseases, the severity of their condition increases, the quality of their life drops further, and the difficulty of treatment increases. A large number of studies have been conducted to monitor the sleep of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and it has been found that there are significant changes in their polysomnography (PSG) results compared to those of healthy control populations. In addition, there are also significant differences between the PSG findings of patients with different neurodegenerative diseases and the differences are closely associated with the pathogenesis and development of the disease. Herein, we discussed the characteristics of the sleep structure of patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies and provided a brief review of the sleep disorders and the PSG characteristics of these patients.

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS), leading to memory and cognitive decline. In AD, the brain experiences three main structural changes: a significant decrease in the quantity of neurons, the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) or senile plaques, which are protein deposits found outside cells and surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Genetic studies have identified four genes associated with autosomal dominant or familial early-onset AD (FAD): amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The formation of plaques primarily involves the accumulation of Aβ, which can be influenced by mutations in APP, PS1, PS2, or ApoE genes. Mutations in the APP and presenilin (PS) proteins can cause an increased amyloid β peptides production, especially the further form of amyloidogenic known as Aβ42. Apart from genetic factors, environmental factors such as cytokines and neurotoxins may also have a significant impact on the development and progression of AD by influencing the formation of amyloid plaques and intracellular tangles. Exploring the causes and implications of protein aggregation in the brain could lead to innovative therapeutic approaches. Some promising therapy strategies that have reached the clinical stage include using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antioxidants, and antiapoptotic agents. The most hopeful therapeutic strategies involve inhibiting activity of secretase and preventing the β-amyloid oligomers and fibrils formation, which are associated with the β-amyloid fibrils accumulation in AD. Additionally, immunotherapy development holds promise as a progressive therapeutic approach for treatment of AD. Recently, the two primary categories of brain stimulation techniques that have been studied for the treatment of AD are invasive brain stimulation (IBS) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). In this article, the amyloid proteins that play a significant role in the AD formation, the mechanism of disease formation as well as new drugs utilized to treat of AD will be reviewed.\n",

      "Depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are substantial public health concerns. In the past decades, a link between two disease entities has received extensive acknowledgment, yet the complex nature of this relationship has demanded further clarification. Some evidence indicates that mid-life depression may be an AD risk factor, while a chronic course of depression in late life may be a precursor to or symptom of dementia. Recently, multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the bidirectional relationship between depression and AD, including genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, the accumulation of AD-related biomarkers (e.g., amyloid beta and tau), and alterations in brain structure. That being the case, numerous therapeutic approaches, such as pharmacology treatments, psychotherapy, and lifestyle interventions, have been suggested as potential means of interfering with these pathways. However, the current literature on this topic remains fragmented and lacks a comprehensive review characterizing the association between depression and AD. In this review, we aim to address these gaps by providing an overview of the co-occurrence and temporal relationship between depression and AD, as well as exploring their underlying mechanisms. We also examine the current therapeutic regimens for depression and their implications for AD management, and outline key challenges facing the field.\n",

      "Alzheimer Associated Diabetes Mellitus, commonly known as Type 3 Diabetes Mellitus (T3DM) is a distinct subtype of diabetes with a pronounced association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin resistance serves as a pivotal link between these two conditions, leading to diminished insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, and impaired glucose uptake. The brain, a vital organ in AD context, is also significantly impacted by insulin resistance, resulting in energy deficits and neuronal damage, which are hallmark features of the neurodegenerative disorder. To pave the way for potential therapeutic interventions targeting the insulin resistance pathway, it is crucial to comprehend the intricate pathophysiology of T3DM and identify the overlapped features between diabetes and AD. This comprehensive review article aims to explore various pathway such as AMPK, PPARγ, cAMP and P13K/Akt pathway as potential target for management of T3DM. Through the analysis of these complex mechanisms, our goal is to reveal their interdependencies and support the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies. The review extensively discusses several promising pharmaceutical candidates that have demonstrated dual drug action mechanisms, addressing both peripheral and cerebral insulin resistance observed in T3DM. These candidates hold significant promise for restoring insulin function and mitigating the detrimental effects of insulin resistance on the brain. The exploration of these therapeutic options contributes to the development of innovative interventions that alleviate the burden of T3DM and enhance patient care.\n",

It was found that the studied compounds with aliphatic amino acid residues showed a low inhibitory ability against cholinesterases. It was established that the pillar[5]arene containing fragments of l-phenylalanine is the most promising inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (IC\n",
      "Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting half of persons with MS (PwMS). Cognitive reserve has been associated with delaying the onset and slowing the progression of CI in PwMS. Multilingualism has been demonstrated to be a protective factor against CI in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but has never been studied in PwMS.\n",
      "To explore if multilingualism is a protective factor against CI in PwMS.\n",
      "This is a retrospective cohort study of PwMS aged 18-59, with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing MS, fluent in English, who completed the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS) at the London (ON) MS Clinic. Any PwMS with a history of dementia or developmental delay, daily marijuana use, a major psychiatric disorder, or less than grade 9 education was excluded. We focused on the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMTR), immediate recall (-IR) and delayed recall (-DR) as it would be the least affected by language, as well as the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), as information processing speed is the most commonly affected domain in PwMS. One-way ANOVA was used to compare raw scores on the BVMTR and SDMT between groups (uni- vs. multillingual), while chi-square was used to compare impairment on BVMTR and SDMT between groups.\n",
      "The cohort consisted of 678 subjects. The mean age was 39.7 (± 9.6) years with 501 (73.9 %) females (sex at birth), the mean duration of disease of 5.9 (± 6.9) years, and mean years of education was 13.9 (±2.2). The majority of subjects (563, 83 %) were unilingual and (115, 17 %) were multilingual; 102 subjects were bilingual and 13 subjects fluent in ≥ three languages. English was the first language was in most of subjects (614, 90.6 %). There was no significant difference on the BVMTR-IR scores (p = 0.189) or BVMTR-DR (p = 0.096) between groups. Similarly, there was no difference in the number of subjects impaired on the BVMTR-IR (X2 (1, N = 678) = 3.167, p = 0.057) or BVMT-DR between groups (X2 (1, N = 678) = 2.996, p = 0.083). Further, there was no significant difference on the SDMT (p = 0.506) between groups, or in number of subjects impaired on the SDMT between groups (X2 (1, N = 678) = 1.023, p = 0.312).\n",
      "This study shows that multilingualism does not have a protective effect against CI in PwMS and does not play a role in enriching the cognitive reserve, in contrast to studies in AD. This difference may be explained by a different underlying pathological mechanism in these diseases and warrants further study.\n",
      "Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are considered risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other related dementias. Clinically approved medications typically prescribed to manage these conditions have shown an association with reduced risk of developing AD and could be explored as potential repurposed therapeutics.\n",
      "We aimed to explore the effects of the pharmacological treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and statins (STAT) on AD-related neuropathology and the potential benefits of their concurrent use.\n",
      "We investigated the effect of ACEI, STAT or combination of both by exploring the transcriptomic, proteomic and tau pathology profiles after treatment in both human patients and in P301S transgenic mice (PS19) modeling tauopathies and AD. We performed bioinformatic analysis of enriched pathways after treatment.\n",
      "Proteomics and transcriptomics analysis revealed proteins and genes whose expression is significantly changed in subjects receiving treatment with ACEI, STAT or combined drugs. In mice, treatment with the ACEI lisinopril significantly decreased brain levels of total tau (Tau) and phosphorylated tau (pTau)-181, while the STAT atorvastatin significantly reduced the levels of pTau-396. The combined therapy with lisinopril and atorvastatin significantly decreased Tau. Moreover, brain levels of lisinopril were negatively correlated with Tau. Among the others, CD200, ADAM22, BCAN and NCAM1 were significantly affected by treatments in both human subjects and transgenic mice.\n",
      "Our findings provide significant information that may guide future investigation of the potential use of ACEI, STAT, or the combination of the two drug classes as repurposed therapies or preventive strategies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the aggregation of disordered proteins, such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau, leading to neurotoxicity and disease progression. Despite numerous efforts, effective inhibitors of Aβ and tau aggregates have not been developed. Thus, we aimed to screen natural small molecules from crude extracts that target various pathologies and are prescribed for patients with neurological diseases. In this study, we screened 162 natural small molecules prescribed for neurological diseases and identified genipin and pyrogallol as hit compounds capable of simultaneously regulating the aggregation of Aβ and tau K18. Moreover, we confirmed the dual modulatory effects of these compounds on the reduction of amyloid-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro and the disassembly of preformed Aβ\n",
      "The literature on the relationship between social interaction and executive functions (EF) in older age is mixed, perhaps stemming from differences in EF measures and the conceptualization/measurement of social interaction. We investigated the relationship between social interaction and EF in 102 cognitively unimpaired older adults (ages 65-90). Participants received an EF battery to measure working memory, inhibition, shifting, and global EF. We measured loneliness subjectively through survey and social isolation objectively through naturalistic observation. Loneliness was not significantly related to any EF measure (\n",
      "Drug designing is high-priced and time taking process with low success rate. To overcome this obligation, computational drug repositioning technique is being promptly used to predict the possible therapeutic effects of FDA approved drugs against multiple diseases. In this computational study, protein modeling, shape-based screening, molecular docking, pharmacogenomics, and molecular dynamic simulation approaches have been utilized to retrieve the FDA approved drugs against AD. The predicted MADD protein structure was designed by homology modeling and characterized through different computational resources. Donepezil and galantamine were implanted as standard drugs and drugs were screened out based on structural similarities. Furthermore, these drugs were evaluated and based on binding energy (Kcal/mol) profiles against MADD through PyRx tool. Moreover, pharmacogenomics analysis showed good possible associations with AD mediated genes and confirmed through detail literature survey. The best 6 drug (darifenacin, astemizole, tubocurarine, elacridar, sertindole and tariquidar) further docked and analyzed their interaction behavior through hydrogen binding. Finally, MD simulation study were carried out on these drugs and evaluated their stability behavior by generating root mean square deviation and fluctuations (RMSD/F), radius of gyration (Rg) and soluble accessible surface area (SASA) graphs. Taken together, darifenacin, astemizole, tubocurarine, elacridar, sertindole and tariquidar displayed good lead like profile as compared with standard and can be used as possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of AD after in-vitro and in-vivo assessment.\n",
      "Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the brain deposition of insoluble amyloidogenic proteins, such as α-synuclein or Tau, and the concomitant deterioration of cell functions such as the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). The ALP is involved in the degradation of intracellular macromolecules including protein aggregates. ALP dysfunction due to inherited defects in lysosomal or non-lysosomal proteins causes a group of diseases called lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) because of abnormal accumulation of lysosomal degradation substrates. Supporting the contribution of ALP defects in neurodegenerative diseases, deposition of amyloidogenic proteins occurs in LSD. Moreover, heterozygous mutations of several ALP genes represent risk factors for Parkinson's disease. The reciprocal contribution of α-synuclein accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction have been extensively studied. However, whether this adverse crosstalk also embraces Tau pathology needs more investigation. Here, we show in human primary fibroblasts that Tau seeds isolated from the brain of Alzheimer's disease induce Tau accumulation in acidic degradative organelles and lysosomal stress. Furthermore, inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme mutated in Gaucher's disease and a main risk for Parkinson's disease, causes lysosomal dysfunction in primary fibroblasts and contributes to the accumulation of Tau. Considering the presence of Tau lesions in Parkinson's disease as well as in multiple neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, our data call for further studies on strategies to alleviate ALP dysfunction as new therapeutic opportunity for neurodegenerative diseases and LSD.\n",
      "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane protein that is predominantly expressed by microglia in the brain. The proteolytic shedding of TREM2 results in the release of soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), which is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It remains unknown whether sTREM2 regulates the pathogenesis of AD. Here we identified transgelin-2 (TG2) expressed on neurons as the receptor for sTREM2. The microglia-derived sTREM2 binds to TG2, induces RhoA phosphorylation at S188, and deactivates the RhoA-ROCK-GSK3β pathway, ameliorating tau phosphorylation. The sTREM2 (77-89) fragment, which is the minimal active sequence of sTREM2 to activate TG2, mimics the inhibitory effect of sTREM2 on tau phosphorylation. Overexpression of sTREM2 or administration of the active peptide rescues tau pathology and behavioral defects in the tau P301S transgenic mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that the sTREM2-TG2 interaction mediates the cross-talk between microglia and neurons. sTREM2 and its active peptide may be a potential therapeutic intervention for tauopathies including AD.\n",
      "Exposure to stressful experiences accounts for almost half of the risk for mental disorders. Hence, stress-induced alterations represent a key target for pharmacological interventions aimed at restoring brain function in affected individuals. We have previously demonstrated that lurasidone, a multi-receptor antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression, can normalize the functional and molecular impairments induced by stress exposure, representing a valuable tool for the treatment of stress-induced mental illnesses. However, the mechanisms that may contribute to the therapeutic effects of lurasidone are still poorly understood. Here, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adult male rats exposed to the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm and we investigated the impact of chronic lurasidone treatment on such changes. We found that CMS exposure leads to an anhedonic phenotype associated with a down-regulation of different pathways associated to neuronal guidance and synaptic plasticity within the PFC. Interestingly, a significant part of these alterations (around 25%) were counteracted by lurasidone treatment. In summary, we provided new insights on the transcriptional changes relevant for the therapeutic intervention with lurasidone, which may ultimately promote resilience.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Despite several decades of research, the development of effective treatments and responses for Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. The utilization of polysaccharides for Alzheimer's disease became more popular due to their beneficial characteristics, notably their multi-target activity and low toxicity. This review mainly focuses on the researches of recent 5 years in the regulation of AD by naturally derived polysaccharides, systematically lists the possible intervention pathways of polysaccharides from different mechanisms, and explores the structure-activity relationship between polysaccharide structural activities, so as to provide references for the intervention and treatment of AD by polysaccharides.\n",
      "Recent studies emphasized the necessity to identify key (human) biological processes and pathways targeted by the Coronaviridae family of viruses, especially Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused up to 33-55 % death rates in COVID-19 patients with malignant neoplasms and Alzheimer's disease. Given this scenario, we identified biological processes and pathways involved in various diseases which are most likely affected by COVID-19.\n",
      "The COVID-19 DisGeNET data set (v4.0) contains the associations between various diseases and human genes known to interact with viruses from Coronaviridae family and were obtained from the IntAct Coronavirus data set annotated with DisGeNET data. We constructed the disease-gene network to identify genes that are involved in various comorbid diseased states. Communities from the disease-gene network were identified using Louvain method and functional enrichment through over-representation analysis methodology was used to discover significant biological processes and pathways shared between COVID-19 and other diseases.\n",
      "The COVID-19 DisGeNET data set (v4.0) comprised of 828 human genes and 10,473 diseases (including various phenotypes) that together constituted nodes in the disease-gene network. Each of the 70,210 edges connects a human gene with an associated disease. The top 10 genes linked to most number of diseases were VEGFA, BCL2, CTNNB1, ALB, COX2, AGT, HLA-A, HMOX1, FGF2 and COMT. The most vulnerable group of patients thus discovered had comorbid conditions such as carcinomas, malignant neoplasms and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we identified 15 potentially useful biological processes and pathways for improved therapies. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the key mediator of angiogenesis in cancer. It is widely distributed in the brain and plays a crucial role in brain inflammation regulating the level of angiopoietins. With a degree of 1899, VEGFA was associated with maximum number of diseases in the disease-gene network. Previous studies have indicated that increased levels of VEGFA in the blood results in dyspnea, Pulmonary Edema (PE), Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In case of COVID-19 patients with neoplasms and other neurological symptoms, our results indicate VEGFA as a therapeutic target for inflammation suppression. As VEGFs are known to disproportionately affect cancer patients, improving endothelial permeability and vasodilation with anti-VEGF therapy could lead to suppression of inflammation and also improve oxygenation. As an outcome of our study, we make case for clinical investigations towards anti-VEGF therapies for such comorbid conditions affected by COVID-19 for better therapeutic outcomes.\n",
      "Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma cholesterol does not pass the blood-brain barrier whereas its metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) can enter the brain. High 27-OHC in the brain has been suggested to mediate hypercholesterolemia-induced impairments of learning and memory through promoting amyloid-β accumulation and facilitating synaptic disruption. In AD brains, the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) is elevated. Treating AD animals with HDAC inhibitors decreases amyloid-β levels and synaptic damages, which leads to memory improvement. Whether HDAC activity is involved in the actions of 27-OHC is still uncertain. In this study, 4 weekly injections of 27-OHC/vehicle were given to rats followed by 3 daily injections of HDAC inhibitor tricohstatin (TSA)/vehicle. The results of Morris water maze test reveal that all rats have intact spatial learning ability during the 5-d training phase. However, the behavioral performance during the probe trial was impaired by 27-OHC treatment, which was improved by adding TSA treatments. Furthermore, 27-OHC treatments reduced the hippocampal levels of acetylated histone H3, acetylated α tubulin, insulin-degrading enzyme and postsynaptic protein PSD-95, indicating that 27-OHC treatments may induce enhanced HDAC activity, decreased amyloid-β clearance and synaptic disruption. All reduced levels returned to the basal levels by adding TSA treatments. These findings support our hypothesis that HDAC activity is enhanced following long-term exposure to excess 27-OHC.\n",
      "Although drugs may slow its progression, authentic cure of AD has never been accomplished. Here, six approaches are suggested that might achieve genuine cure. The six therapies include: 1) treatments addressing levels of TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin, that become significantly reduced after MCI transitions to AD, and addressing also the impaired epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in AD's pathogenesis; 2) and 3) are two formulations that address the inadequate counter-responses to initial loss of cognition; 4) treatments addressing the brain cells whose impaired functions result in MCI and dementia; 5) the need for using partner drugs even when a particular drug addresses a single pathogenetic cause such as amyloid deposition; 6) enhancing the likelihood of genuine cure by using combinations of approaches chosen from the foregoing. Briefly, genuine cure of AD is possible; however, since AD denotes not one but multiple, phenotypically similar conditions, no one therapy can be generalized to all cases.\n",
      "Despite widespread sex differences in prevalence and presentation of numerous illnesses affecting the human brain, there has been little focus on the effect of endocrine ageing. Most preclinical studies have focused on males only, and clinical studies often analyse data by covarying for sex, ignoring relevant differences between the sexes. This sex- (and gender)-neutral approach is biased and contributes to the absence of targeted treatments and services for all sexes (and genders). Female health has been historically understudied, with grave consequences for their wellbeing and health equity. In this Review, we spotlight female brain health across the lifespan by informing on the role of sex steroids, particularly oestradiol, on the female brain and on risk for diseases more prevalent in females, such as depression and Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "The current work is focused on developing mannose-coated PLGA nanoparticles for delivering Donepezil and Memantine in one dosage form. The formulated nanoparticles were prepared using a simple emulsification technique. The final coated NPs exhibited 179.4 nm size and - 33.1 mV zeta potential and spherical shape. The concentration of IN-administrated MEM and DPZ mannose coated NPs in brain was ~573 and 207 ng/mL respectively. This amount accounts for 3 times more in comparison to uncoated NPs administered via intranasal and peroral routes. The plasma concentration of coated NPs administered via the intranasal route was various times less in comparison to other groups. In the field of pharmacodynamics, the administration of coated NPs via the IN route has shown superior efficacy in comparison to other groups in various investigations involving neurobehavioral assessments, gene expression analyses and biochemical estimations. The findings indicate that the IN route may be a potential avenue for delivering therapeutic agents using nanoparticles to treat neurological illnesses. This approach shows promise as a viable alternative to traditional dose forms and administration methods.\n",
      "The current neuropsychiatric nosological categories underlie pragmatic treatment choice, regulation and clinical research but does not encompass biological rationale. However, subgroups of patients suffering from schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease have more in common than the neuropsychiatric nature of their condition, such as the expression of social dysfunction. The PRISM project presents here initial quantitative biological insights allowing the first steps toward a novel trans-diagnostic classification of psychiatric and neurological symptomatology intended to reinvigorate drug discovery in this area. In this study, we applied spectral clustering on digital behavioural endpoints derived from passive smartphone monitoring data in a subgroup of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease patients, as well as age matched healthy controls, as part of the PRISM clinical study. This analysis provided an objective social functioning characterization with three differential clusters that transcended initial diagnostic classification and was shown to be linked to quantitative neurobiological parameters assessed. This emerging quantitative framework will both offer new ways to classify individuals in biologically homogenous clusters irrespective of their initial diagnosis, and also offer insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these clusters.\n",
      "The application of the selective allosteric M1 muscarinic and sigma-1 receptor agonist, AF710B (aka ANAVEX3-71), has shown to attenuate Alzheimer's disease-like hallmarks in McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rats when administered at advanced pathological stages. It remains unknown whether preventive treatment strategies applying this compound may be equally effective. We tested whether daily oral administration of AF710B (10 µg/kg) in 7-month-old, preplaque, McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats for 7 months, followed by a 4-week washout period, could prevent Alzheimer's disease-like pathological hallmarks. Long-term AF710B treatment prevented the cognitive impairment of McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats. The effect was accompanied by a reduction in the number of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and the levels of Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides in the cerebral cortex. AF710B treatment also reduced microglia and astrocyte recruitment toward CA1 hippocampal Aβ-burdened neurons compared to vehicle-treated McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats, also altering the inflammatory cytokines profile. Lastly, AF710B treatment rescued the conversion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor precursor to its mature and biologically active form. Overall, these results suggest preventive and disease-modifying properties of the compound.\n",
      "Lead is a common environmental heavy metal contaminant. Humans are highly susceptible to lead accumulation in the body, which causes nervous system damage and leads to a variety of nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Recent research has focused on the mechanisms of lead-induced neurotoxicity at multiple levels, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, which are involved in various lead-induced nervous system diseases. We reviewed the latest articles and summarised the emerging roles of DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs in lead-induced neurotoxicity. Our summary provides a theoretical basis and directions for future research on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lead-induced neurological diseases.\n",
      "Autoantibodies against surface neuronal antigens have been associated with specific neurological presentations including autoimmune encephalitis (AE), with variable association with neoplasia and infections.\n",
      "We described the phenotype and environmental associations of patients with neurological syndromes associated with antibodies against neuronal surface antigens who were referred to a tertiary center in the South of Brazil. All patients were tested for neuronal autoantibodies using cell-based assays. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings were retrospectively reviewed.\n",
      "We identified 16 patients, 15 had subacute, and one had a progressive disease course. Among patients with subacute onset, 11 (73 %) were N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptor (NMDAr-IgG)+, 3 (20 %) were Leucine-rich Glioma-Inactivated-1 (LGI1-IgG)+, and 1 (6 %) was positive for Glycine receptor-IgG. The patient with a progressive disease course had antibodies against IgLON5. Most patients had disease onset in spring and summer suggesting environmental factors for the development of AE. Also, we observed a different pattern of brain lesions when NMDAr-IgG encephalitis followed herpes encephalitis and a previously unreported association with Rosai-Dorfman-Destombe disease. All patients with encephalopathy met criteria for possible AE and all proven NMDAr-IgG+ met criteria for NMDAr-IgG encephalitis. However, only one LGI1-IgG+ patient fulfilled clinical criteria for limbic encephalitis. All but one received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, 11 also had intravenous human immunoglobulin, and 4 plasma exchange. Furthermore, all patients received second-line immunotherapy. Importantly, most patients improved with immunotherapy, even when initiated later in the disease course.\n",
      "We identified seasonal variability associated with neuronal surface antibodies suggesting environmental triggers. Also, we described the coexistence of NMDAr-IgG encephalitis with histiocytosis. In our series, most patients received second-line immunotherapy. We observed neurologic improvement after treatment even in cases of delayed diagnosis. Increasing the recognition and availability of tests and treatments for these conditions is of paramount importance in low- and middle-income countries.\n",
      "During the past two decades, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been widely used to study human neural development and disease. Especially in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), remarkable effort has been put into investigating molecular mechanisms behind this disease. Then, with the advent of 3D neuronal cultures and cerebral organoids (COs), several studies have demonstrated that this model can adequately mimic familial and sporadic AD. Therefore, we created an AD-CO model using iPSCs derived from patients with familial AD forms and explored early events and the progression of AD pathogenesis. Our study demonstrated that COs derived from three AD-iPSC lines with PSEN1(A246E) or PSEN2(N141I) mutations developed the AD-specific markers in vitro, yet they also uncover tissue patterning defects and altered development. These findings are complemented by single-cell sequencing data confirming this observation and uncovering that neurons in AD-COs likely differentiate prematurely.\n",
      "In present times, a switch from chemical molecules towards natural products is taking place, and the latter is being increasingly explored in the management of diseases due to their broad range of therapeutic potential. Consumption of coffee is thought to reduce Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanism is still unexplored. Primarily, it is thought that components of coffee are the key players in making it a neuroprotectant. Caffeic acid (CA) is found in high quantities in coffee; thus, it is being increasingly explored to decipher its neuroprotection by various mechanisms. Iron is a toxic element in a free form capable of causing oxidative damage and ultimately contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, maintaining the proper iron levels is vital and human transferrin (Htf), a glycoprotein, is a key player in this aspect. In this work, we explored the binding mechanism of CA with Htf at the atomistic level, employing molecular docking and extensive molecular dynamics simulation (MD) approaches coupled with spectroscopic techniques in a bid to decipher the mode of interaction of CA with Htf. Molecular docking results demonstrated a strong binding affinity between CA and Htf. Furthermore, MD study highlighted the Htf-CA complex's stability and the ligand's minimal impact on Htf's overall structure. In silico approaches were further backed up by experimental approaches. Strong binding of CA with Htf was ascertained by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy observations. Together, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the Htf-CA interaction, adding to the knowledge of the use of CA in the treatment of AD, thereby adding another feather to its already known neuroprotective role.\n",
      "There are currently no drugs that meaningfully slow down the progression of Huntington's disease (HD). Moreover, drug candidates against a single molecular target have not had significant success. Therefore, a different approach to HD drug discovery is needed. Previously we showed that the flavonol fisetin is efficacious in mouse and fly models of HD (Hum. Mol. Gen. 20:261, 2011). It is also effective in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), ischemic stroke, and the CNS complications of diabetes, all of which share some pathological features with HD. Potent derivatives of fisetin with improved pharmacology were made that maintain its multiple biological activities (J. Med. Chem. 55:378, 2012). From 160 synthetic fisetin derivatives, one, CMS121, was selected for further study in the context of HD based on pharmacological parameters and its efficacy in animal models of AD. Both R6/2 and YAC128 mouse models of HD were used in these studies. We examined motor function using multiple assays as well as survival. In the R6/2 mice, we also looked at the effects of CMS121 on striatal gene expression. In both models, we found a slowing of motor dysfunction and an increase in median life span. Interestingly, in the YAC128 mice, the effects on the slowing in motor function loss became increasingly more pronounced as the mice aged. CMS121 also reduced HD-driven changes in the expression of genes associated with the proteasome and oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, these results suggest that CMS121 could provide some benefits for HD patients, particularly with regard to increasing health span.\n",
      "As Hearing loss and dementia affect people with the same profile, several epidemiological studies have evaluated their relationship. However, the link between age-related hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease is still unclear.\n",
      "We selected subjects with no history of exposure to loud noises, blasts, head trauma with hearing loss, or sudden sensorineural hearing loss from a cohort intended to study preclinical phases of Alzheimer's disease. Participants are volunteers over 55 years without cognitive impairment. We correlated the results of an objective auditory evaluation with brain amyloid and p-tau181 levels and with the outcomes of a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment.\n",
      "Fifty-five subjects at different stages of the Alzheimer's disease continuum were evaluated. There were no statistically significant correlations between amyloid-β and p-tau levels and any of the objective auditory measures. A weak but significant correlation was found between amyloid-β values and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly. The neuropsychological domains more correlated to hearing loss were executive function and processing speed.\n",
      "Age-related hearing loss is not linked to any pathological markers of Alzheimer's disease nor to neuropsychological domains typically affected in this disease. The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly has an important component of subjectivity and further studies are needed to explore its relationship with amyloid-β levels.\n",
      "Diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is one of the complications of diabetes mellitus with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. Trichostatin A (TSA) has been revealed to show protective effect on central nervous systems in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of TSA on cognitive function of DE are unknown. Here, we demonstrated that cognitive function was damaged in diabetic mice versus normal mice and treatment with TSA improved cognitive function in diabetic mice. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus revealed 174 differentially expressed proteins in diabetic mice compared with normal mice. TSA treatment reversed the expression levels of 111 differentially expressed proteins grouped into functional clusters, including the longevity regulating pathway, the insulin signaling pathway, peroxisomes, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction network analysis of TSA-reversed proteins revealed that UBA52, CAT, RPL29, RPL35A, CANX, RPL37, and PRKAA2 were the main hub proteins. Multiple KEGG pathway-enriched CAT and PRKAA2 levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of diabetic mice versus normal mice, which was reversed by TSA administration. Finally, screening for potential similar or ancillary drugs for TSA treatment indicated that HDAC inhibitors ISOX, apicidin, and panobinostat were the most promising similar drugs, and the PI3K inhibitor GSK-1059615, the Aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib, and the nucleophosmin inhibitor avrainvillamide-analog-6 were the most promising ancillary drugs. In conclusion, our study revealed that CAT and PRKAA2 were the key proteins involved in the improvement of DE after TSA treatment. ISOX, apicidin, and panobinostat were promising similar drugs and that GSK-1059615, alisertib, and avrainvillamide-analog-6 were promising ancillary drugs to TSA in the treatment of DE.\n",
      "Observational studies consistently demonstrate that physical activity is associated with elevated cognitive function, however, there remains significant heterogeneity in cognitive outcomes from randomized exercise interventions. Individual variation in sleep behaviours may be a source of variability in the effectiveness of exercise-induced cognitive change, however this has not yet been investigated. The current study aimed to (1) investigate the influence of a 6-month exercise intervention on sleep, assessed pre- and post-intervention and, (2) investigate whether baseline sleep measures moderate exercise-induced cognitive changes.\n",
      "We utilised data from the Intense Physical Activity and Cognition (IPAC) study (n = 89), a 6-month moderate intensity and high intensity exercise intervention, in cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling older adults aged 60-80 (68.76 ± 5.32). Exercise was supervised and completed on a stationary exercise bicycle, and cognitive function was measured using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery administered pre- and post-intervention. Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. There was no effect of the exercise intervention on any sleep outcomes from pre- to post-intervention.\n",
      "There was a significant moderating effect of baseline sleep efficiency on both episodic memory and global cognition within the moderate intensity exercise group, such that those with poorer sleep efficiency at baseline showed greater exercise-induced improvements in episodic memory.\n",
      "These results suggest that those with poorer sleep may have the greatest exercise-induced cognitive benefits and that baseline sleep behaviours may be an important source of heterogeneity in previous exercise interventions targeting cognitive outcomes.\n",

      "Aggravated neuronal loss, caused mainly by neuronal apoptosis, is observed in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and animal models of AD. A truncated form of Dual-specific and tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) plays a vital role in AD pathogenesis. Downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL is tightly correlated with neuronal loss in AD. However, the molecular regulation of neuronal apoptosis and Bcl-x expression by Dyrk1A in AD remains largely elusive. Here, we aimed to explore the role and molecular mechanism of Dyrk1A in apoptosis.\n",
      "Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), flow cytometry, and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) were used to check apoptosis. The cells, transfected with Dyrk1A or/and ASF with Bcl-x minigene, were used to assay Bcl-x expression by RT-PCR and Western blots. Co-immunoprecipitation, autoradiography, and immunofluorescence were conducted to check the interaction of ASF and Dyrk1A. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of apoptosis-related genes was performed in mice overexpressing Dyrk1A (TgDyrk1A) and AD model 5xFAD mice.\n",

      "Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) is a diagnostic marker for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the accuracy of quantitative MTA (QMTA) in diagnosing early AD is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of QMTA and its related components (inferior lateral ventricle [ILV] and hippocampus) with MTA in the early diagnosis of MCI and AD.\n",
      "This study included four groups: normal (NC), MCI stable (MCIs), MCI converted to AD (MCIs), and mild AD (M-AD) groups. Magnetic resonance image analysis software was used to quantify the hippocampus, ILV, and QMTA. MTA was rated by two experienced neurologists. Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed to compare their capability in differentiating AD from NC and MCI, and optimal thresholds were determined using the Youden index.\n",

      "Neurodegenerative disease is a collective term for a category of diseases that are caused by neuronal dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs without the 3' cap and 5' poly(A) and are linked by covalent bonds. CircRNAs are highly expressed in brain neurons and can regulate the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting the levels of various deposition proteins.\n",
      "This review is aiming to suggest that the majority of circRNAs influence neurodegenerative pathologies mainly by affecting the abnormal deposition of proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "We systematically summarized the pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases and the regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in various types of neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "Neurodegenerative disease main features include intercellular ubiquitin-proteasome system abnormalities, changes in cytoskeletal proteins, and the continuous deposition of insoluble protein fragments and inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm or nucleus, resulting in impairment of the normal physiological processes of the neuronal system. CircRNAs have multiple mechanisms, such as acting as microRNA sponges, binding to proteins, and regulating transcription. CircRNAs, which are highly stable molecules, are expected to be potential biomarkers for the pathological detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Impaired autophagy in plaque-associated microglia (PAM) has been reported to accelerate amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive impairment in AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that the transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is a promising treatment approach for AD. Moreover, the complementary therapy of intermittent hypoxia therapy (IHT) has been shown to upregulate autophagy and impart beneficial effects in patients with AD. However, the effect of IHT on PAM remains unknown.\n",
      "8-Month-old APP/PS1 mice were treated with IHT for 28 days. Spatial learning memory capacity and anxiety in mice were investigated. AD pathology was determined by the quantity of nerve fibers and synapses density, numbers of microglia and neurons, Aβ plaque deposition, pro-inflammatory factors, and the content of Aβ in the brain. TFEB-mediated autophagy was determined by western blot and qRT-PCR. Primary microglia were treated with oligomeric Aβ 1-42 (oAβ) combined with IHT for mechanism exploration. Differential genes were screened by RNA-seq. Autophagic degradation process of intracellular oAβ was traced by immunofluorescence.\n",
      "In this study, we found that IHT ameliorated cognitive function by attenuating neuronal loss and axonal injury in an AD animal model (APP/PS1 mice) with beta-amyloid (Aβ) pathology. In addition, IHT-mediated neuronal protection was associated with reduced Aβ accumulation and plaque formation. Using an in vitro PAM model, we further confirmed that IHT upregulated autophagy-related proteins, thereby promoting the Aβ autophagic degradation by PAM. Mechanistically, IHT facilitated the nuclear localization of TFEB in PAM, with TFEB activity showing a positive correlation with Aβ degradation by PAM in vivo and in vitro. In addition, IHT-induced TFEB activation was associated with the inhibition of the AKT-MAPK-mTOR pathway.\n",
      "These results suggest that IHT alleviates neuronal damage and neuroinflammation via the upregulation of TFEB-dependent Aβ clearance by PAM, leading to improved learning and memory in AD mice. Therefore, IHT may be a promising non-pharmacologic therapy in complementary medicine against AD.\n",

We included participants aged 18 years or older with symptomatic sporadic small vessel disease or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and an indication for antihypertensive treatment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three sequences of antihypertensive treatment using a computer-generated multiblock randomisation, stratified by study site and patient group. A 2-week washout period was followed by three 4-week periods of oral monotherapy with amlodipine, losartan, or atenolol at approved doses. The primary endpoint was change in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) determined by blood oxygen level-dependent MRI response to hypercapnic challenge in normal-appearing white matter from the end of washout to the end of each treatment period. Efficacy analyses were done by intention-to-treat principles in all randomly assigned participants who had at least one valid assessment for the primary endpoint, and analyses were done separately for participants with sporadic small vessel disease and CADASIL.

      "Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, are associated with microgliosis. Microglia have long been considered to have detrimental roles in Alzheimer's disease. However, functional analyses of genes encoding risk factors that are linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and that are enriched or exclusively expressed in microglia, have revealed unexpected protective functions. One of the major risk genes for Alzheimer's disease is TREM2. Risk variants of TREM2 are loss-of-function mutations affecting chemotaxis, phagocytosis, lipid and energy metabolism, and survival and proliferation. Agonistic anti-TREM2 antibodies have been developed to boost these protective functions in patients with intact TREM2 alleles. Several anti-TREM2 antibodies are in early clinical trials, and current efforts aim to achieve more efficient transport of these antibodies across the blood-brain barrier. PET imaging could be used to monitor target engagement. Data from animal models, and biomarker studies in patients, further support a rationale for boosting TREM2 functions during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease.\n",

      "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is an important driver of Tau pathology, gliosis, and degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Still, the mechanisms underlying these APOE4-driven pathological effects remain elusive. Here, we report in a tauopathy mouse model that APOE4 promoted the nucleocytoplasmic translocation and release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from hippocampal neurons, which correlated with the severity of hippocampal microgliosis and degeneration. Injection of HMGB1 into the hippocampus of young APOE4-tauopathy mice induced considerable and persistent gliosis. Selective removal of neuronal APOE4 reduced HMGB1 translocation and release. Treatment of APOE4-tauopathy mice with HMGB1 inhibitors effectively blocked the intraneuronal translocation and release of HMGB1 and ameliorated the development of APOE4-driven gliosis, Tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and myelin deficits. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that treatment with HMGB1 inhibitors diminished disease-associated and enriched disease-protective subpopulations of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in APOE4-tauopathy mice. Thus, HMGB1 inhibitors represent a promising approach for treating APOE4-related AD.\n",
      "Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, is essential for neuronal function, and it acts on ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). A disturbance in glutamatergic signaling is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Developing disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative diseases targeting glutamate receptors is a promising avenue. The understudied group III mGluR 4, 6-8 are commonly found in the presynaptic membrane, and their activation inhibits glutamate release. Thus, targeted mGluRs therapies could aid in treating neurodegenerative diseases. This review describes group III mGluRs and their pharmacological ligands in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. Attempts to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs in clinical trials are also discussed. Despite a growing list of group III mGluR-specific pharmacological ligands, research on the use of these drugs in neurodegenerative diseases is limited, except for Parkinson's disease. Future efforts should focus on delineating the contribution of group III mGluR to neurodegeneration and developing novel ligands with superior efficacy and a favorable side effect profile for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "Early detection is necessary for the treatment of dementia. Computerized testing has become more widely used in clinical trials; however, it is unclear how sensitive these measures are to early signs of neurodegeneration. We investigated the use of the NIH Toolbox-Cognition (NIHTB-CB) and Cogstate-Brief computerized neuropsychological batteries in the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus healthy older adults [healthy control (HC)] and amnestic (aMCI) versus nonamnestic MCI (naMCI). Exploratory analyses include investigating potential racial differences.\n",

      "The NIH Toolbox-CB subtests of Flanker, Picture Sequence Memory, and Picture Vocabulary significantly differentiated MCI from HC. Further, subtests from both computerized batteries differentiated patients with aMCI from those with naMCI. Although the main effect of race differences was noted on tests and in diagnostic groups was significant, there were no significant race-by-test interactions.\n",
      "Computer-based subtests vary in their ability to help distinguish MCI subtypes, though these tests provide less expensive and easier-to-administer clinical screeners to help identify patients early who may qualify for more comprehensive evaluations.

Acute standardized total average toxicity (rSTATacute) was modelled using a generalized linear regression model for additive effect of genetic variants adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. LD score regression estimated shared SNP-based heritability of rSTATacute in all patients and for each cancer type.\n",
      "Shared SNP-based heritability of STATacute among all cancer types was estimated at 10% (se = 0.02), and was higher for prostate (17%, se = 0.07), head and neck (27%, se = 0.09), and breast (16%, se = 0.09) cancers. We identified 130 suggestive associated SNPs with rSTATacute (5.0x10-8<P-value<1.0x10-5) across 25 genomic regions. rs142667902 showed the strongest association (effect allele A; effect size -0.17; P-value=1.7x10-7), which is located near DPPA4, encoding a protein involved in pluripotency in stem cells, which are essential for repair of radiation-induced tissue injury. Gene-set enrichment analysis identified 'RNA splicing via endonucleolytic cleavage and ligation' (P = 5.1 x10-6, Pcorrected =0.079) as the top gene set associated with rSTATacute among all patients. In-silico gene expression analysis showed the genes associated with rSTATacute were statistically significantly up-regulated in skin (not sun exposed Pcorrected=0.004; sun exposed Pcorrected=0.026).\n",

      "With the global rise in Alzheimer disease (AD), early screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a preclinical stage of AD, is of paramount importance. Although biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid amyloid level and magnetic resonance imaging have been studied, they have limitations, such as high cost and invasiveness. Digital markers to assess cognitive impairment by analyzing behavioral data collected from digital devices in daily life can be a new alternative. In this context, we developed a \"virtual kiosk test\" for early screening of MCI by analyzing behavioral data collected when using a kiosk in a virtual environment.\n",
      "We aimed to investigate key behavioral features collected from a virtual kiosk test that could distinguish patients with MCI from healthy controls with high statistical significance. Also, we focused on developing a machine learning model capable of early screening of MCI based on these behavioral features.\n",
      "A total of 51 participants comprising 20 healthy controls and 31 patients with MCI were recruited by 2 neurologists from a university hospital. The participants performed a virtual kiosk test-developed by our group-where we recorded various behavioral data such as hand and eye movements. Based on these time series data, we computed the following 4 behavioral features: hand movement speed, proportion of fixation duration, time to completion, and the number of errors. To compare these behavioral features between healthy controls and patients with MCI, independent-samples 2-tailed t tests were used. Additionally, we used these behavioral features to train and validate a machine learning model for early screening of patients with MCI from healthy controls.\n",

      "Our research preliminarily suggests that analyzing hand and eye movements in the virtual kiosk test holds potential as a digital marker for early screening of MCI. In contrast to conventional biomarkers, this digital marker in virtual reality is advantageous as it can collect ecologically valid data at an affordable cost and in a short period (5-15 minutes), making it a suitable means for early screening of MCI. We call for further studies to confirm the reliability and validity of this approach.\n",
      "Digital loneliness interventions for older adults are promising, yet conclusive evidence is lacking due to a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and difficulties with recruitment.

The RCT participants were allocated either to the main group of older adults (aged 65 years or older) or the side group (aged between 18 and 64 years). The side group used networking to play with the older adults. We also conducted 6 post-RCT evaluation interviews and 1 focus group with a total of 4 RCT participants and 5 welfare organization representatives that aided in RCT recruitment.\n",
      "In total, 371 people aged 18 years or older signed up for the RCT, of which 64% (238/371) were aged 65 years or older. Of the total sample, 20% (76/371) installed the app and signed informed consent, showing a large dropout during onboarding. The high number of questions was a relevant barrier for participants. Both questionnaire and gameplay adherence were low. Participants indicated that the games elicited contact and a feeling of togetherness and proposed challenging and competitive games with increasing difficulty levels. They suggested focusing on enjoying the games rather than administering questionnaires.\n",

Occipital hypoperfusion was offered higher diagnostic utility than the CIS.\n",

      "Pharmacotherapy for most psychiatric conditions was developed from serendipitous observations of benefit from drugs prescribed for different reasons. An algorithmic approach to formulating pharmacotherapy is proposed, based upon which combination of changed activities by brain cell-types is dominant for any particular condition, because those cell-types contain and surrogate for genetic, metabolic and environmental information, that has affected their function. The algorithm performs because functions of some or all the affected cell-types benefit from several available drugs: clemastine, dantrolene, erythropoietin, fingolimod, fluoxetine, lithium, memantine, minocycline, pioglitazone, piracetam, and riluzole PROCEDURES/FINDINGS: Bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and post-traumatic stress disorder, illustrate the algorithm; for them, literature reviews show that no single combination of altered cell-types accounts for all cases; but they identify, for each condition, which combination occurs most frequently, i.e., dominates, as compared with other possible combinations. Knowing the dominant combination of altered cell-types in a particular condition, permits formulation of therapy with combinations of drugs taken from the above list. The percentage of patients who might benefit from that therapy, depends upon the frequency with which the dominant combination occurs in patients with that particular condition.\n",
      "Knowing the dominant combination of changed cell types in psychiatric conditions, permits an algorithmically formulated, rationally-based treatment. Different studies of the same condition often produce discrepant results; all might be correct, because identical clinical phenotypes result from different combinations of impaired cell-types, thus producing different results.

All participants were asked to fill out a uniform survey which included details about their demographics, daily habits, and any illnesses they were dealing with. The Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were employed to measure their levels of anxiety and depression, respectively. In addition, 50 healthy individuals also agreed to brain MR imaging. The finding of our study indicated that those with inadequate sleep had higher levels of depression and anxiety, and the overall anxiety and depression score was linked to the total PSQI score in a positive manner; The MRI subgroup analysis revealed that those with inadequate sleep quality had a greater thickness of the left transverse temporal gyrus (p < 0.05). In addition, a Linear regression analysis of the mediation model showed that poor sleep quality would result in higher scores on the GDS, and cortical thickness in the left transverse temporal gyrus played a fully mediated role in this process. Our research indicates that elderly people in community who have difficulty sleeping may be more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression, and this lack of sleep can result in depressive symptoms due to its impact on the thickness of the left transverse temporal cortex.\n",
      "Cranial irradiation (IR) negatively regulates hippocampal neurogenesis and causes cognitive dysfunctions in cancer survivors, especially in pediatric patients. IR decreases proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPC) and consequently diminishes production of new hippocampal neurons. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, used clinically to improve cognition in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia. In animal models, memantine acts as a potent enhancer of hippocampal neurogenesis. Memantine was recently proposed as an intervention to improve cognitive impairments occurring after radiotherapy and is currently under investigation in a number of clinical trials, including pediatric patients. To date, preclinical studies investigating the mechanisms underpinning how memantine improves cognition after IR remain limited, especially in the young, developing brain. Here, we investigated whether memantine could restore proliferation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) or rescue the reduction in the number of hippocampal young neurons after IR in the juvenile mouse brain.\n",

      "We show that acute intraperitoneal treatment with a high, non-clinically used, dose of memantine (50 mg/kg) increased the number of proliferating cells in the intact brain by 72% and prevented 23% of IR-induced decrease in proliferation. Long-term treatment with 10 mg/kg/day of memantine, equivalent to the clinically used dose, did not impact proliferation, neither in the intact brain, nor after IR, but significantly increased the number of young neurons (doublecortin expressing cells) with radial dendrites (29% in sham controls and 156% after IR) and enhanced their dendritic arborization. Finally, we found that long-term treatment with 10 mg/kg/day memantine did not affect the levels of BDNF, but significantly reduced the levels of NGF by 40%.\n",

      "We utilized deformation-based morphometry (DBM) in a whole-brain exploratory approach to identify the regional brain volumes associated with gait speed assessed over a short distance during an in-home assessment. We created deformation scores to summarize the gait-associated regions and entered the scores into a series of longitudinal mixed effects models to determine the extent to which deformation predicted change in cognition over time, controlling for associations between gait and cognition.\n",
      "In 438 older adults (81 ± 7; 76% female), DBM revealed that slower gait speed was associated with smaller volumes across frontal white matter, temporal grey matter, and subcortical areas and larger volumes in the ventricles during the same testing cycle. When a subset was followed over multiple (5 ± 2) years, slower gait speed was also associated with annual declines in global cognition, executive functioning, and memory abilities. Several of the gait-related brain structures were associated with these declines in cognition; however, larger ventricles and smaller medial temporal lobe volumes proved most robust and attenuated the association between slow gait and cognitive decline.\n",

AD is neuropathologically characterized by the presence of beta-amyloid immunoreactive senile plaques and tau positive neurofibrillary tangles. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD however continue to be underscored, and therefore, neuropathological correlates of these neuropsychiatric symptoms are not readily studied. Presented here is a case of 60-year-old female who initially presented with anxiety and depression, and continued to be the predominant symptoms although mild cognitive impairment was noted as per the available clinical notes. Postmortem examination of the brain revealed severe Alzheimer's type neuropathological changes, which included significant tau and beta-amyloid pathology in limbic regions, which were thought to represent correlates of the patient's depression and anxiety. This case report illustrates the possible neuropathological correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD. The author hopes that such a case will promote more in-depth studies into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric manifestations in AD.\n",
      "Women with early ovarian removal (<48 years) have an elevated risk for both late-life Alzheimer's disease (AD) and insomnia, a modifiable risk factor. In early midlife, they also show reduced verbal episodic memory and hippocampal volume. Whether these reductions correlate with a sleep phenotype consistent with insomnia risk remains unexplored.\n",
      "We recruited thirty-one younger middleaged women with risk-reducing early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), fifteen of whom were taking estradiol-based hormone replacement therapy (BSO+ERT) and sixteen who were not (BSO). Fourteen age-matched premenopausal (AMC) and seventeen spontaneously peri-postmenopausal (SM) women who were ~10y older and not taking ERT were also enrolled. Overnight polysomnography recordings were collected at participants' home across multiple nights (M=2.38 SEM=0.19), along with subjective sleep quality and hot flash ratings. In addition to group comparisons on sleep measures, associations with verbal episodic memory and medial temporal lobe volume were assessed.\n",
      "Increased sleep latency and decreased sleep efficiency were observed on polysomnography recordings of those not taking ERT, consistent with insomnia symptoms. This phenotype was also observed in the older women in SM, implicating ovarian hormone loss. Further, sleep latency was associated with more forgetting on the paragraph recall task, previously shown to be altered in women with early BSO. Both increased sleep latency and reduced sleep efficiency were associated with smaller anterolateral entorhinal cortex volume.\n",
      "Together, these findings confirm an association between ovarian hormone loss and insomnia symptoms, and importantly, identify an younger onset age in women with early ovarian removal, which may contribute to poorer cognitive and brain outcomes in these women.\n",
      "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, identifying objective biomarkers that can predict brain stimulation efficacy, remains a challenge. The primary aim of this investigation is to delineate the cerebral regions implicated in AD, taking into account the existing lacuna in comprehension of these regions. In pursuit of this objective, we have employed a supervised machine learning algorithm to prognosticate the neurophysiological outcomes resultant from the confluence of tDCS therapy plus cognitive intervention within both the cohort of responders and non-responders to antecedent tDCS treatment, stratified on the basis of antecedent cognitive outcomes.\n",

      "Due to the insidious progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), surrogate decision-makers typically make medical and long-term-care decisions for a care recipient, most often a family care partner. Unfortunately, many care recipient/care partner dyads have failed to engage in advance care planning or have lost the opportunity to do so due to the cognitive decline of the care recipient. To address this need, our team created a validated dementia-focused advance care planning tool known as the LEAD Guide (Life-Planning in Early Alzheimer's and Other Dementias). With funding from the National Alzheimer's Association and in consultation with our community advisory board, we developed a preliminary web-based intervention. This intervention integrates the LEAD Guide with self-paced educational modules that lead dyads through conversations and dementia-focused advance care planning processes. In this concept paper, we describe the aims of our funded R01 clinical trial (National Institute on Aging), where we aim to refine our preliminary web-based platform for use in a 5-month mixed-method NIH Stage-1 behavioral intervention. Using a sample of diverse community-based ADRD dyads (n = 60), we aim to: 1) describe the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of the intervention, 2) assess the initial efficacy of the intervention on the primary outcome (decision-making self-efficacy), and secondary outcomes (relationship quality, subjective well-being, anxiety) as perceived by both the care recipient and the care partner, and 3) examine advance care planning congruence as a mechanism of action. The LEAD clinical trial addresses public health challenges by guiding and supporting families through challenging advance care planning conversations, facilitating the transfer of knowledge regarding care preferences and values from the care recipient to the care partner, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for both individuals with ADRD and their care partners.\n",
      "Intercellular communication between diverse cell types is crucial for the maintenance of the central nervous system, and exosomes have been shown to play an important role in this process. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are released by all cell types and carry cargoes that can elicit downstream effects in recipient cells. Exosomal communication in the central nervous system has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Alzheimer's disease to major depressive disorder.

      "Multimodal neuroimaging data of various brain disorders provides valuable information to understand brain function in health and disease. Various neuroimaging-based databases have been developed that mainly consist of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

This novel initiative includes neurochemical and magnetic susceptibility data for healthy and diseased conditions, acquired using MR spectroscopy (MRS) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) respectively. The SWADESH architecture also provides a neuroimaging database which includes MRI, MRS, functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), QSM, neuropsychological data and associated data analysis pipelines. Our final objective is to provide a master database of major brain disease states (neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and others) and to identify characteristic features and biomarkers associated with such disorders.\n",
      "It is helpful to understand the pathology of Alzheimer's disease by exploring the relationship between amyloid-β accumulation and cognition. The study explored the relationship between regional amyloid-β accumulation and multiple cognitions and study their application value in the Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. 135 participants completed 18F-florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography (PET), structural MRI, and a cognitive battery. Partial correlation was used to examine the relationship between global and regional amyloid-β accumulation and cognitions. Then, a support vector machine was applied to determine whether cognition-related accumulation regions can adequately distinguish the cognitively normal controls (76 participants) and mild cognitive impairment (30 participants) groups or mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (29 participants) groups. The result showed that amyloid-β accumulation regions were mainly located in the frontoparietal cortex, calcarine fissure, and surrounding cortex and temporal pole regions. Episodic memory-related regions included the frontoparietal cortices; executive function-related regions included the frontoparietal, temporal, and occipital cortices; and processing speed-related regions included the frontal and occipital cortices. Support vector machine analysis showed that only episodic memory-related amyloid-β accumulation regions had better classification performance during the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Assessing regional changes in amyloid, particularly in frontoparietal regions, can aid in the early detection of amyloid-related decline in cognitive function.\n",
      ": To investigate the relationship between reduced glutathione (GSH), a key molecule of the antioxidant defense system in the blood, and glutathione reductase (GR), which reduces oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide [GSSG]) to GSH and maintains the redox balance, with the prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia and cognitive decline.\n",
      ": In all, 20 participants with Alzheimer's dementia who completed the third follow-up clinical evaluation over 6 years were selected, and 20 participants with normal cognition were selected after age and sex matching. The GSH and GR concentrations were the independent variables. Clinical diagnosis and neurocognitive test scores were the dependent variables indicating cognitive status.\n",
      ": The higher the level of GR, the greater the possibility of having normal cognition than of developing Alzheimer's dementia. Additionally, the higher the level of GR, the higher the neurocognitive test scores. However, this association was not significant for GSH. After 6 years, the conversion rate from normal cognition to cognitive impairment was significantly higher in the lower 50th percentile of the GR group than in the upper 50th percentile.\n",
      ": The higher the GR, the lower the prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia and incidence of cognitive impairment and the higher the cognitive test scores. Therefore, GR is a potential protective biomarker against Alzheimer's dementia and cognitive decline.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting el-derly individuals, characterized by cognitive decline and dysfunction in the nervous system. The disease is hallmarked by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-β plaques. Approx-imately 10.7% of the global population aged 65 and above suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and this number is projected to rise significantly in the foreseeable future. By the year 2050, the worldwide prevalence is estimated to reach 139 million cases, compared to the current 55 million cases. The identification of reliable biomarkers that can facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNA mol-ecules that play a significant role in mRNA regulation and protein level maintenance through mRNA degradation. Over the past decade, researchers have primarily focused on elucidating the functions and expression patterns of miRNAs in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, to uncover their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. This review emphasizes the potential of miR-NAs as diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and explores their roles and therapeutic possibilities. MiRNAs possess several features that make them ideal biomarkers, including their ability to be easily detected in body fluids. Moreover, the extraction process is minimally inva-sive, as miRNAs can be readily extracted. Advances in technology have facilitated the integration of miRNAs into micro-assays, enhancing the reliability and utility of miRNAs as diagnostic bi-omarkers for Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "The neurodegenerative disorders are age-related illnesses that cause the morphology or activity of neurons to deteriorate over time. Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative illness in the long run. The rate of advancement might vary, even though it is a progressive neurological illness. Various explanations have been proposed, however the true etiology of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. Most pharmacological interventions are based on the cholinergic theory, that is earliest idea. In accordance with the amyloid hypothesis, the buildup of beta-amyloid in brain regions is the primitive cause of illness. There is no proof that any one strategy is useful in avoiding Alzheimer's disease, though some epidemiological studies have suggested links within various modifiable variables, such as cardiovascular risk, diet and so on. Different metals like zinc, iron, and copper are naturally present in our bodies. In metal chelation therapy drugs are used to jam the metal ions from combining with other molecules in the body. Clioquinol is one of the metal chelation drugs used by researchers. Research on metal chelation is still ongoing. In the present review, we go over the latest developments in prevalence, incidence, etiology, or pathophysiology of our understanding of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, a brief discussion on the development of therapeutic chelating agents and their viability as Alzheimer's disease medication candidates is presented. We also assess the effect of clioquinol as a potential metal chelator.\n",
      "In vivo imaging and accurate identification of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque are crucial in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. In this work, we propose to combine the coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, a powerful detection technology for providing Raman spectra and label-free imaging, with deep learning to distinguish Aβ from non-Aβ regions in AD mice brains in vivo. The 1D CARS spectra is firstly converted to 2D CARS figures by using two different methods: spectral recurrence plot (SRP) and spectral Gramian angular field (SGAF). This can provide more learnable information to the network, improving the classification precision. We then devise a cross-stage attention network (CSAN) that automatically learns the features of Aβ plaques and non-Aβ regions by taking advantage of the computational advances in deep learning. Our algorithm yields higher accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity than the results of conventional multivariate statistical analysis method and 1D CARS spectra combined with deep learning, demonstrating its competence in identifying Aβ plaques. Last but not least, the CSAN framework requires no prior information on the imaging modality and may be applicable to other spectroscopy analytical fields.\n",

      "APOE genotype is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 increases AD risk up to 12-fold compared to APOE3, an effect that is greater in females. Evidence suggests that one-way APOE could modulate AD risk and progression through neuroinflammation. Indeed, APOE4 is associated with higher glial activation and cytokine levels in AD patients and mice. Therefore, identifying pathways that contribute to APOE4-associated neuroinflammation is an important approach for understanding and treating AD. Human and in vivo evidence suggests that TLR4, one of the key receptors involved in the innate immune system, could be involved in APOE-modulated neuroinflammation. Consistent with that idea, we previously demonstrated that the TLR4 antagonist IAXO-101 can reduce LPS- and Aβ-induced cytokine secretion in APOE4 glial cultures. Therefore, the goal of this study was to advance these findings and determine whether IAXO-101 can modulate neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology, and behavior in mice that express APOE4.\n",
      "We used mice that express five familial AD mutations and human APOE3 (E3FAD) or APOE4 (E4FAD). Female and male E4FAD mice and female E3FAD mice were treated with vehicle or IAXO-101 in two treatment paradigms: prevention from 4 to 6 months of age or reversal from 6 to 7 months of age. Learning and memory were assessed by modified Morris water maze. Aβ deposition, fibrillar amyloid deposition, astrogliosis, and microgliosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Soluble levels of Aβ and apoE, insoluble levels of apoE and Aβ, and IL-1β were measured by ELISA.\n",

IAXO-101-treated male E4FAD mice also had lower Iba-1 coverage and reactivity in the RVS paradigm, but there was no effect on behavior. There was also no effect of IAXO-101 treatment on neuroinflammation and behavior in female E3FAD mice.\n",

      "To enable successful inclusion of electroencephalography (EEG) outcome measures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials, we retrospectively mapped the progression of resting-state EEG measures over time in amyloid-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to AD.\n",
      "Resting-state 21-channel EEG was recorded in 148 amyloid-positive AD patients (MCI, n = 88; dementia due to AD, n = 60). Two or more EEG recordings were available for all subjects. We computed whole-brain and regional relative power (i.e., theta (4-8 Hz), alpha1 (8-10 Hz), alpha2 (10-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz)), peak frequency, signal variability (i.e., theta permutation entropy), and functional connectivity values (i.e., alpha and beta corrected amplitude envelope correlation, theta phase lag index, weighted symbolic mutual information, inverted joint permutation entropy). Whole-group linear mixed effects models were used to model the development of EEG measures over time. Group-wise analysis was performed to investigate potential differences in change trajectories between the MCI and dementia subgroups. Finally, we estimated the minimum sample size required to detect different treatment effects (i.e., 50% less deterioration, stabilization, or 50% improvement) on the development of EEG measures over time, in hypothetical clinical trials of 1- or 2-year duration.\n",
      "Whole-group analysis revealed significant regional and global oscillatory slowing over time (i.e., increased relative theta power, decreased beta power), with strongest effects for temporal and parieto-occipital regions. Disease severity at baseline influenced the EEG measures' rates of change, with fastest deterioration reported in MCI patients. Only AD dementia patients displayed a significant decrease of the parieto-occipital peak frequency and theta signal variability over time. We estimate that 2-year trials, focusing on amyloid-positive MCI patients, require 36 subjects per arm (2 arms, 1:1 randomization, 80% power) to detect a stabilizing treatment effect on temporal relative theta power.\n",
      "Resting-state EEG measures could facilitate early detection of treatment effects on neuronal function in AD patients. Their sensitivity depends on the region-of-interest and disease severity of the study population. Conventional spectral measures, particularly recorded from temporal regions, present sensitive AD treatment monitoring markers.\n",
      "The cerebral ventricles are recognized as windows into brain development and disease, yet their genetic architectures, underlying neural mechanisms and utility in maintaining brain health remain elusive. Here we aggregated genetic and neuroimaging data from 61,974 participants (age range, 9 to 98 years) in five cohorts to elucidate the genetic basis of ventricular morphology and examined their overlap with neuropsychiatric traits. Genome-wide association analysis in a discovery sample of 31,880 individuals identified 62 unique loci and 785 candidate genes associated with ventricular morphology. We replicated over 80% of loci in a well-matched cohort of lateral ventricular volume. Gene set analysis revealed enrichment of ventricular-trait-associated genes in biological processes and disease pathogenesis during both early brain development and degeneration. We explored the age-dependent genetic associations in cohorts of different age groups to investigate the possible roles of ventricular-trait-associated loci in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes. We describe the genetic overlap between ventricular and neuropsychiatric traits through comprehensive integrative approaches under correlative and causal assumptions. We propose the volume of the inferior lateral ventricles as a heritable endophenotype to predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease, which might be a consequence of prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides an advance in understanding the genetics of the cerebral ventricles and demonstrates the potential utility of ventricular measurements in tracking brain disorders and maintaining brain health across the lifespan.\n",
      "Microglial involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology has emerged as a risk-determining pathogenic event. While apolipoprotein E (APOE) is known to modify AD risk, it remains unclear how microglial apoE impacts brain cognition and AD pathology. Here, using conditional mouse models expressing apoE isoforms in microglia and central nervous system-associated macrophages (CAMs), we demonstrate a cell-autonomous effect of apoE3-mediated microglial activation and function, which are negated by apoE4. Expression of apoE3 in microglia/CAMs improves cognitive function, increases microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and reduces amyloid pathology and associated toxicity, whereas apoE4 expression either compromises or has no effects on these outcomes by impairing lipid metabolism. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling reveals increased antigen presentation and interferon pathways upon apoE3 expression. In contrast, apoE4 expression downregulates complement and lysosomal pathways, and promotes stress-related responses. Moreover, in the presence of mouse endogenous apoE, microglial apoE4 exacerbates amyloid pathology. Finally, we observed a reduction in Lgals3-positive responsive microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and an increased accumulation of lipid droplets in APOE4 human brains and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. Our findings establish critical isoform-dependent effects of microglia/CAM-expressed apoE in brain function and the development of amyloid pathology, providing new insight into how apoE4 vastly increases AD risk.\n",

However, when studies with diagnosis of SDB based on polysomnography were pooled together, the strength of association for all-cause cognitive impairment was weaker (HR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.74).\n",
      "Findings suggest a possible association of SDB/OSA with risk of all-cause cognitive impairment and/or dementia. However, careful interpretation is warranted as the majority of the studies did not rely on objective assessment based on polysomnography.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. In addition to amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau, neuroinflammation is a crucial element in the etiology of this disease. However, the relevance of inflammasome-induced pyroptosis to AD is unknown. We aimed to clarify whether the anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin could prevent Aβ-mediated activation of the inflammasome. We demonstrated that Aβ upregulated NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD, and cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase caspase (caspase 1) expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Melatonin prevented inflammasome signaling and excessive cytokine release caused by Aβ. We found that ethyl 2[(2-chlorophenyl)(hydroxy) methyl]acrylate (INF-4E, NLRP3 and caspase 1 inhibitor) significantly abolished Aβ-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression. The increase in cleaved-caspase 1, pro-IL18, and cleaved-IL18 caused by Aβ suggested the occurrence of pyroptosis, which was further confirmed by the increased expression of N-terminal gasdermin D (N-GSDMD). Melatonin plays a protective role against Aβ-induced inflammation via an inflammasome-associated mechanism that is essential in inducing the active forms of cytokines and pyroptosis. The ability of melatonin to inhibit inflammasome may represent a turning point in the treatment of AD progression.\n",

      "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the strongest risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been revealed to cause greater accumulation of extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates than does APOE3 in traditional transgenic mouse models of AD. However, concerns that the overexpression paradigm might have affected the phenotype remain. Amyloid precursor protein (APP)-knock-in (KI) mice, incorporating APP mutations associated with AD development, offer an alternative approach for overproducing pathogenic Aβ without needing overexpression of APP. Here, we present the results of comprehensive analyses of pathological and biochemical traits in the brains of APP-KI mice harboring APP-associated familial AD mutations (APP\n",
      "Misfolding and aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are key hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With accumulating evidence suggesting that different Aβ species have varied neurotoxicity and implications in AD development, the discovery of affinity ligands and analytical approaches to selective distinguish, detect, and monitor Aβ becomes an active research area. Remarkable advances have been achieved, which not only promote our understanding of the biophysical chemistry of the protein aggregation during neurodegeneration, but also provide promising tools for early detection of the disease. In view of this, we summarize the recent progress in selective and sensitive approaches for tracking and detection of Aβ species. Specific attentions are given to soluble Aβ oligomers, due to their crucial roles in AD development and occurrence at early stages. The design principle, performance of targeting units, and their cooperative effects with signal reporters for Aβ analysis are discussed. The applications of the novel targeting probes and sensing systems for dynamic monitoring oligomerization, measuring Aβ in biosamples and in vivo imaging in brain are summarized. Finally, the perspective and challenges are discussed regarding the future development of Aβ-targeting analytical tools to explore the unknown field to contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of AD.\n",
      "Ginsenosides are main active compounds of Panax ginseng with pharmacological effects on immunological/neurological diseases. Recently, ginsenoside-Re (G-Re) has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, whether G-Re has an effect on multiple sclerosis (MS), a representative autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), has not been revealed yet.\n",
      "The purpose of this study was to investigate pharmacological effects of G-Re and related molecular mechanisms using a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide-immunized experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of MS and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bEND.3 cells as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).\n",
      "G-Re attenuated motor impairment of EAE, demyelination, and inflammation in spinal cords of EAE mice. G-Re reduced infiltration/activation of microglia/macrophages and decreased mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6), chemokines (MIP-1α, MCP-1, and RANTES), and enzymes (iNOS) in spinal cords of EAE mice. G-Re inhibited alterations of BBB constituents (such as astrocytes, cell adhesion molecule (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1), and tight junctional molecules (occludin and zonula occludens-1)) and toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MyD88/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathways in spinal cords of EAE mice and LPS-stimulated bEND.3 cells. Interestingly, combination treatment with G-Re and TLR4 inhibitor (TAK242) significantly inhibited the upregulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in LPS-stimulated bEND.3 cells. TLR4 inhibitor- and activator-treated EAE mice showed conflicting behavior patterns.\n",
      "G-Re might alleviate motor impairment of EAE and its pathological/inflammatory events in the spinal cord by preventing BBB disruption via downregulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways. These findings for the first time suggest that G-Re might be a potential therapeutic for MS through maintenance of BBB integrity.\n",

      "Raddeanin A was identified to reduce β-amyloidosis in U87 cells and 3 x Tg-AD mice model of AD by decreasing level of BACE1, APP, APP-β and Aβ. Raddeanin A improved behavioral, spatial memory and learning ability in the AD mice. In the cortex and hippocampus, raddeanin A improved the morphology and arrangement of neurons, lower the level of reactive astrocyte marker GFAP and apoptotic marker proteins Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Moreover, raddeanin A upregulated the mRNA and protein level of Prkcα in the hippocampus of AD mice whose neuroprotective effect was exerted possibly via the activation of protein kinase C.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an extremely prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in the regulation of AD. However, the function of most lncRNAs in AD remains to be elucidated. In this study, the effects of lncRNA ENST00000440246.1 on the biological characteristics of AD were explored. Differentially expressed lncRNAs in AD were identified through bioinformatics analysis and peripheral blood from thirty AD patients was collected to verify the expression of these lncRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The correlations between lncRNAs and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were assessed by Pearson's correlation analysis. Immunofluorescence (IF), Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays were conducted to evaluate the biological effect of ENST00000440246.1 and protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) in SK-N-SH cells. Gene expression at the protein and mRNA levels was analyzed by Western blotting and RT-qPCR. The interaction between PP2A and ENST00000440246.1 was confirmed by IntaRNA and RNA pulldown assays. ENST00000440246.1 was upregulated and significantly negatively correlated with the MMSE and MoCA scores and the overexpression of ENST00000440246.1 inhibited cell proliferation and facilitated apoptosis and Aβ expression in SK-N-SH cells. Mechanistically, ENST00000440246.1 targeted PP2A and regulated AD-related gene expression. The silencing of ENST00000440246.1 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, PP2A overexpression reversed the influence of ENST00000440246.1 overexpression in SK-N-SH cells. In conclusion, ENST00000440246.1 could promote AD progression by targeting PP2A, which indicates that ENST00000440246.1 has the potential to be a diagnostic target in AD.\n",
      "Autophagy involves the sequestration and delivery of cytoplasmic materials to lysosomes, where proteins, lipids, and organelles are degraded and recycled. According to the way the cytoplasmic components are engulfed, autophagy can be divided into macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Recently, many studies have found that autophagy plays an important role in neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, neuronal excitotoxicity, and cerebral ischemia. Autophagy maintains cell homeostasis in the nervous system via degradation of misfolded proteins, elimination of damaged organelles, and regulation of apoptosis and inflammation. AMPK-mTOR, Beclin 1, TP53, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and other signal pathways are involved in the regulation of autophagy and can be used as potential therapeutic targets for neurological diseases. Here, we discuss the role, functions, and signal pathways of autophagy in neurological diseases, which will shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of neurological diseases and suggest novel targets for therapies.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly heterogenous neurodegenerative disease, and several omic-based datasets were generated in the last decade from the patients with the disease. However, the vast majority of studies evaluate these datasets in bulk by considering all the patients as a single group, which obscures the molecular differences resulting from the heterogeneous nature of the disease. In this study, we adopted a personalized approach and analyzed the transcriptome data from 403 patients individually by mapping the data on a human protein-protein interaction network. Patient-specific subnetworks were discovered and analyzed in terms of the genes in the subnetworks, enriched functional terms, and known AD genes. We identified several affected pathways that could not be captured by the bulk comparison. We also showed that our personalized findings point to patterns of alterations consistent with the recently suggested AD subtypes.\n",
      "Ophthalmic biomarkers have long played a critical role in diagnosing and managing ocular diseases. Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.\n",

      "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in long-lived human populations have led to identification of variants associated with Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease, the latter being the most common cause of mortality in people worldwide. In contrast, naturally occurring cancer represents the leading cause of death in pet dogs, and specific breeds like the Golden Retriever (GR) carry up to a 65% cancer-related death rate. We hypothesized that GWAS of long-lived GRs might lead to the identification of genetic variants capable of modifying longevity within this cancer-predisposed breed. A GWAS was performed comparing GR dogs ≥ 14 years to dogs dying prior to age 12 which revealed a significant association to ERBB4, the only member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family capable of serving as both a tumor suppressor gene and an oncogene. No coding variants were identified, however, distinct haplotypes in the 5'UTR were associated with reduced lifespan in two separate populations of GR dogs. When all GR dogs were analyzed together (n = 304), the presence of haplotype 3 was associated with shorter survival (11.8 years vs. 12.8 years, p = 0.024). GRs homozygous for haplotype 3 had the shortest survival, and GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 had the longest survival (11.6 years vs. 13.5 years, p = 0.0008). Sub-analyses revealed that the difference in lifespan for GRs carrying at least 1 copy of haplotype 3 was specific to female dogs (p = 0.009), whereas survival remained significantly different in both male and female GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 or haplotype 3 (p = 0.026 and p = 0.009, respectively). Taken together, these findings implicate a potential role for ERBB4 in GR longevity and provide evidence that within-breed canine lifespan studies could serve as a mechanism to identify favorable or disease-modifying variants important to the axis of aging and cancer.\n",

      "The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is described as a division of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), located within the gut wall and it is formed by two main plexuses: the myenteric plexus (Auerbach's) and the submucosal plexus (Meissner's). The contribution of the ENS to the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease has been described in the literature, while some other studies have found a connection between epilepsy and the gastrointestinal tract. The above could be explained by cholinergic neurons and neurotransmission systems in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, regulating the vagal excitability effect. It is also understandable, as the discharges arising in the amygdala are transmitted to the intestine through projections the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, giving rise to efferent fibers that stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and consequently the symptoms at this level. Therefore, this review's main objective is to argue in favor of the existing relationship of the ENS with the Central Nervous System (CNS) as a facilitator of epileptogenic or ictogenic mechanisms. The gut microbiota also participates in this interaction; however, it depends on many individual factors of each human being. The link between the ENS and the CNS is a poorly studied epileptogenic site with a big impact on one of the most prevalent neurological conditions such as epilepsy.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recognized as the most important cause of dementia, which is estimated to contribute more than 2 trillion USD in medical costs. AD patients encounter progressive neurodegenerative dementia associated with behavioural, linguistic, and visuospatial deficits. Although studies on the discovery of amyloid β (Aβ) and tau (the essential elements of plaques and tangles in AD) have shed light on the molecular pathological processes of AD, the exact cause of the condition is still largely unknown. The involvement of various proteins, such as amyloid-β, prion protein, tau, and α-synuclein has been linked to AD pathogenesis. The current AD treatments are mainly based on symptomatic management and restoration of neurotransmitters' balance. There is a significant need to develop medications that can alter the underlying disease process and prevent its progression. The present manuscript provides a review of various hypotheses that have been proposed for AD pathogenesis. The manuscript has also explored the development of novel anti-AD drugs based on various pathogenic pathways, which are recently under various clinical trial phases.\n",

      "Neuropsychiatric disorders, which are associated with stress hormone dysregulation, occur at different rates in men and women. Moreover, nowadays, preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrates that sex and gender can lead to differences in stress responses that predispose males and females to different expressions of similar pathologies. In this curated review, we focus on what is known about sex differences in classic mechanisms of stress response, such as glucocorticoid hormones and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), which are components of the hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis. Then, we present sex differences in neurotransmitter levels, such as serotonin, dopamine, glutamate and GABA, as well as indices of neurodegeneration, such as amyloid β and Tau. Gonadal hormone effects, such as estrogens and testosterone, are also discussed throughout the review. We also review in detail preclinical data investigating sex differences caused by recentlyrecognized regulators of stress and disease, such as the immune system, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, as well neurosteroids. Finally, we discuss how understanding sex differences in stress responses, as well as in pharmacology, can be leveraged into novel, more efficacious therapeutics for all. Based on the supporting evidence, it is obvious that incorporating sex as a biological variable into preclinical research is imperative for the understanding and treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease.\n",

      "Amyloids, protein, and peptide assemblies in various organisms are crucial in physiological and pathological processes. Their intricate structures, however, present significant challenges, limiting our understanding of their functions, regulatory mechanisms, and potential applications in biomedicine and technology. This study evaluated the AlphaFold2 ColabFold method's structure predictions for antimicrobial amyloids, using eight antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including those with experimentally determined structures and AMPs known for their distinct amyloidogenic morphological features. Additionally, two well-known human amyloids, amyloid-β and islet amyloid polypeptide, were included in the analysis due to their disease relevance, short sequences, and antimicrobial properties. Amyloids typically exhibit tightly mated β-strand sheets forming a cross-β configuration. However, certain amphipathic α-helical subunits can also form amyloid fibrils adopting a cross-α structure. Some AMPs in the study exhibited a combination of cross-α and cross-β amyloid fibrils, adding complexity to structure prediction. The results showed that the AlphaFold2 ColabFold models favored α-helical structures in the tested amyloids, successfully predicting the presence of α-helical mated sheets and a hydrophobic core resembling the cross-α configuration. This implies that the AI-based algorithms prefer assemblies of the monomeric state, which was frequently predicted as helical, or capture an α-helical membrane-active form of toxic peptides, which is triggered upon interaction with lipid membranes.\n",
      "In 2020, the fifth Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia (CCCDTD5) published up-to-date recommendations for the clinical management of persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their caregivers.

With the aid of family physicians and the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging, we selected the most relevant CCCDTD5 recommendations for primary care and tailored and summarized them in the present manuscript to facilitate their reference and use. These recommendations focus on (a) risk reduction, (b) screening and diagnosis, (c) deprescription of dementia medications, and (d) non-pharmacological interventions. The development of recommendations for the ongoing management of dementia is an iterative process as new evidence on interventions for dementia is published.

      "Kluver-Bucy Syndrome (KBS) is a rare neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by hyperorality, hypersexuality, bulimia, visual agnosia, and amnesia due to lesions affecting bilateral temporal lobes. It is attributed to a multitude of causes, including stroke, herpes simplex encephalitis, Alzheimer's disease, and head trauma. Current treatments for KBS include symptomatic management with antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, carbamazepine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The bibliometric analysis was done to reflect the relevance and understanding of KBS in recent literature. The SCOPUS database was utilized to conduct a search for all articles with the terms \"Kluver-Bucy\" and \"Kluver Bucy\" from January 1, 1955 (the first available articles from the search) to February 1, 2023. The parameters included in this analysis were article title, citation numbers, citations per year, authors, institutions, publishing journals, country of origin, Source Normalized Impact per Paper, and Scopus CiteScore. Since 1937, when Kluver-Bucy Syndrome was first defined, the publications on KBS have steadily increased, with up to six publications a year in 2002. The most common institutions were SUNY Upstate Medical University, VA Medical Center, and the State University of New York (SUNY) System. Seven of these papers were published in \n",

      "In modern scientific research, data heterogeneity is commonly observed owing to the abundance of complex data. We propose a factor regression model for data with heterogeneous subpopulations. The proposed model can be represented as a decomposition of heterogeneous and homogeneous terms. The heterogeneous term is driven by latent factors in different subpopulations. The homogeneous term captures common variation in the covariates and shares common regression coefficients across subpopulations. Our proposed model attains a good balance between a global model and a group-specific model. The global model ignores the data heterogeneity, while the group-specific model fits each subgroup separately. We prove the estimation and prediction consistency for our proposed estimators, and show that it has better convergence rates than those of the group-specific and global models. We show that the extra cost of estimating latent factors is asymptotically negligible and the minimax rate is still attainable. We further demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method by studying its prediction error under a mis-specified group-specific model. Finally, we conduct simulation studies and analyze a data set from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and an aggregated microarray data set to further demonstrate the competitiveness and interpretability of our proposed factor regression model.\n",
      "Throughout their lives, humans encounter a plethora of substances capable of inducing neurotoxic effects, including drugs, heavy metals and pesticides. Neurotoxicity manifests when exposure to these chemicals disrupts the normal functioning of the nervous system, and some neurotoxic agents have been linked to neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The growing concern surrounding the neurotoxic impacts of both naturally occurring and man-made toxic substances necessitates the identification of animal models for rapid testing across a wide spectrum of substances and concentrations, and the utilization of tools capable of detecting nervous system alterations spanning from the molecular level up to the behavioural one.

      "Periodontitis is caused by dysbiosis of oral microbes and is associated with increased cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and recently, a potential functional link was proposed between oral microbes and AD. We compared the oral microbiomes of patients with or without AD to evaluate the association between oral microbes and AD in periodontitis.\n",
      "Periodontitis patients with AD (n = 15) and cognitively unimpaired periodontitis patients (CU) (n = 14) were recruited for this study. Each patient underwent an oral examination and neuropsychological evaluation. Buccal, supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were collected, and microbiomes were analysed by next-generation sequencing. Alpha diversity, beta diversity, linear discriminant analysis effect size, analysis of variance-like differential expression analysis and network analysis were used to compare group oral microbiomes.\n",
      "All 29 participants had moderate to severe periodontitis. Group buccal and supragingival samples were indistinguishable, but subgingival samples demonstrated significant alpha and beta diversity differences. Differential analysis showed subgingival samples of the AD group had higher prevalence of Atopobium rimae, Dialister pneumosintes, Olsenella sp. HMT 807, Saccharibacteria (TM7) sp. HMT 348 and several species of Prevotella than the CU group. Furthermore, subgingival microbiome network analysis revealed a distinct, closely connected network in the AD group comprised of various Prevotella spp. and several anaerobic bacteria.\n",

      "Tau tubulin kinase-1 (TTBK1), a neuron-specific tau kinase, is highly expressed in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal regions, where early tau pathology evolves in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The protein expression level of TTBK1 is elevated in the cortex brain tissues with AD patients compared to the control subjects. We therefore hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) based targeting Ttbk1 could prevent the accumulation of phosphorylated tau, thereby delaying the development of tau pathology in AD. Here we show that in vivo administration of ASO targeting mouse Ttbk1 (ASO-Ttbk1) specifically suppressed the expression of Ttbk1 without affecting Ttbk2 expression in the temporal cortex of PS19 tau transgenic mice. Central administration of ASO-Ttbk1 in PS19 mice significantly reduced the expression level of representative phosphor-tau epitopes relevant to AD at 8 weeks post-dose, including pT231, pT181, and pS396 in the sarkosyl soluble and insoluble fractions isolated from hippocampal tissues as determined by ELISA and pS422 in soluble fractions as determined by western blotting. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that ASO-Ttbk1 significantly reduced pS422 phosphorylated tau intensity in mossy fibers region of the dentate gyrus in PS19 mice. RNA-sequence analysis of the temporal cortex tissue revealed significant enrichment of interferon-gamma and complement pathways and increased expression of antigen presenting molecules (Cd86, Cd74, and H2-Aa) in PS19 mice treated with ASO-Ttbk1, suggesting its potential effect on microglial phenotype although neurotoxic effect was absent. These data suggest that TTBK1 is an attractive therapeutic target to suppress TTBK1 without compromising TTBK2 expression and pathological tau phosphorylation in the early stages of AD.\n",
      "The vagus nerve serves as a critical connection between the central nervous system and internal organs. Originally known for its effectiveness in treating refractory epilepsy, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has shown potential for managing other brain diseases, including ischaemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the precise mechanisms of VNS and its benefits for brain diseases are not yet fully understood. Recent studies have found that VNS can inhibit inflammation, promote neuroprotection, help maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, have multisystemic modulatory effects, and even transmit signals from the gut flora to the brain. In this article, we will review several essential studies that summarize the current theories of VNS and its immunomodulatory effects, as well as the therapeutic value of VNS for brain disorders. By doing so, we aim to provide a better understanding of how the neuroimmune network operates and inspire future research in this field.\n",

      "Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a serine/threonine kinase, which regulates programmed cell death and inflammation. Recently, the involvement of RIPK1 in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported; RIPK1 is involved in microglia's phenotypic transition to their dysfunctional states, and it is highly expressed in the neurons and microglia in the postmortem brains in AD patients. They prompt neurodegeneration leading to accumulations of pathological proteins in AD. Therefore, regulation of RIPK1 could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD, and in vivo imaging of RIPK1 may become a useful modality in studies of drug discovery and pathophysiology of AD.

      "Prion disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of an abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) in the central nervous system. To identify PrPSc aggregates for diagnostic purposes, pathologists use immunohistochemical staining of prion protein antibodies on tissue samples. With digital pathology, artificial intelligence can now analyze stained slides. In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for the identification of PrPSc aggregates in tissue samples from the cerebellar and occipital cortex. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to evaluate PrPSc deposition in digital images. We used two strategies: a deep learning segmentation approach using a vision transformer, and a machine learning classification approach with traditional classifiers. Our method was developed and tested on 64 whole slide images from 41 patients definitively diagnosed with prion disease. The results of our study demonstrated that our proposed framework can accurately classify WSIs from a blind test set. Moreover, it can quantify PrPSc distribution and localization throughout the brain. This could potentially be extended to evaluate protein expression in other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Overall, our pipeline highlights the potential of AI-assisted pathology to provide valuable insights, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia. It is known that women with one ApoE4 allele display greater risk and earlier onset of AD compared with men. In mice, we previously showed that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a gonadotropin that rises in post-menopausal females, activates its receptor FSHR in the hippocampus, to drive AD-like pathology and cognitive impairment. Here we show in mice that ApoE4 and FSH jointly trigger AD-like pathogenesis by activating C/EBPβ/δ-secretase signaling. ApoE4 and FSH additively activate C/EBPβ/δ-secretase pathway that mediates APP and Tau proteolytic fragmentation, stimulating Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles. Ovariectomy-provoked AD-like pathologies and cognitive defects in female ApoE4-TR mice are ameliorated by anti-FSH antibody treatment. FSH administration facilitates AD-like pathologies in both young male and female ApoE4-TR mice. Furthermore, FSH stimulates AD-like pathologies and cognitive defects in ApoE4-TR mice, but not ApoE3-TR mice. Our findings suggest that in mice, augmented FSH in females with ApoE4 but not ApoE3 genotype increases vulnerability to AD-like process by activating C/EBPβ/δ-secretase signalling.\n",

      "There is a need for blood biomarkers to detect individuals at different Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages because obtaining cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers is invasive and costly. Plasma phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau) have shown potential as such biomarkers. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), threonine 217 (p-tau217) and threonine 231 (p-tau231) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. All p-tau isoforms increase as a function of Aβ-accumulation and discriminate healthy individuals from those at preclinical AD stages with high accuracy. P-tau231 increases earliest, followed by p-tau181 and p-tau217. In advanced stages, all p-tau isoforms are associated with the clinical classification of AD and increase with disease severity, with the greatest increase seen for p-tau217. This is also reflected by a better correlation of p-tau217 with Aβ scans, whereas both, p-tau217 and p-tau181 correlated equally with tau scans. However, at the very advanced stages, p-tau181 begins to plateau, which may mirror the trajectory of the Aβ pathology and indicate an association with a more intermediate risk of AD. Across the AD continuum, the incremental increase in all biomarkers is associated with structural changes in widespread brain regions and underlying cognitive decline. Furthermore, all isoforms differentiate AD from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, making them specific for AD. Incorporating p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 in clinical use requires further studies to examine ideal cut-points and harmonize assays.\n",

Pooled analysis of primary outcome showed that CA was associated with significant reduction in the risk of Dementia (HR, 0.63(95%CI: 0.52-0.77), P<0.001). Similarly, pooled analysis of secondary outcomes showed that the patients with CA had a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR, 0.78(95%CI: 0.66-0.92), P<0.001) compared with the non-CA group.

      "The aberrant accumulation of tau protein is implicated as a pathogenic factor in many neurodegenerative diseases. Tau seeding may underlie its predictable spread in these diseases. Molecular chaperones can modulate tau pathology, but their effects have mainly been studied in isolation. This study employed a semi-high throughput assay to identify molecular chaperones influencing tau seeding using Tau RD P301S FRET Biosensor cells, which express a portion of tau containing the frontotemporal dementia-related P301S tau mutation fused to a FRET biosensor. Approximately fifty chaperones from five major families were screened using live cell imaging to monitor FRET-positive tau seeding. Among the tested chaperones, five exhibited significant effects on tau in the primary screen. Notably, three of these were from the DnaJ family. In subsequent studies, overexpression of DnaJA2, DnaJB1, and DnaJB6b resulted in significant reductions in tau levels. Knockdown experiments by shRNA revealed an inverse correlation between DnaJB1 and DnaJB6b with tau levels. DnaJB6b overexpression, specifically, reduced total tau levels in a cellular model with a pre-existing pool of tau, partially through enhanced proteasomal degradation. Further, DnaJB6b interacted with tau complexes. These findings highlight the potent chaperone activity within the DnaJ family, particularly DnaJB6b, towards tau.\n",

The baseline and 4-year rate of change in NBM volume and cholinergic pathways mean diffusivity were compared. Associations between cholinergic index changes and pathological processes and cognitive performance were evaluated. After controlling for age, sex, APOE genotype, and total intracranial volume, Obj-SCI individuals exhibited reduced NBM volume and increased medial pathway mean diffusivity compared to HC at baseline. Furthermore, amyloid-positive Obj-SCI individuals exhibited a steeper longitudinal decline in NBM volume than HC. Additionally, decreases in NBM volume and cholinergic pathways integrity were associated with amyloid and vascular pathologies and cognitive decline. Overall, degeneration of the cholinergic system plays an important role in cognitive impairment during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease, which may provide a significant target for early therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by hippocampal, and cortical neuron deterioration, oxidative stress, and severe cognitive dysfunction. Aluminum is a neurotoxin inducer for cognitive impairments associated with AD. The treatment approaches for AD are unsatisfactory. Boswellia papyrifera and Syzygium aromaticum are known for their pharmacological assets, including antioxidant activity. Therefore, the current study explored the possible mitigating effects of a combination of Boswellia papyrifera and Syzygium aromaticum against aluminum chloride (AlCl3) induced AD. The AD model was established using AlCl3 (100 mg/kg), and the rats were orally administrated with Boswellia papyrifera or Syzygium aromaticum or a combination of them daily for 8 weeks. The Y-maze test was used to test cognition in the rats, while acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and oxidative stress markers were estimated in homogenates of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Also, the histopathological examination of the cortex and hippocampus were investigated. The results revealed that administration of either B. papyrifera or S. aromaticum extracts significantly improved the cognitive functions of AD rats, enhanced AChE levels, increased oxidative enzymes levels, including SOD and GSH, and reduced MDA levels in homogenates of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and confirmed by improvement in histological examination. However, using a combination therapy gave better results compared to a single treatment. In conclusion, the present study provided primary evidence for using a combination of B. papyrifera and S. aromaticum to treat cognitive dysfunction associated with AlCl3 Induced AD by improving the AChE levels and modulating oxidative stress in the brain.\n",

(C. songaricum) is a herb with promising neuroprotective effects and the function is majorly attributed to flavonoids. The current study attempted to explore the effects of total flavonoids of C. songaricum (CS) on AD model by focusing on changes in BDNF/TrkB axis. AD model was induced in rats via transcranial injection of Aβ1-42 and AD symptoms treated with CS of three doses. Donepezil was used as the positive control. Changes in rat memory and learning abilities, brain histological, apoptosis, production of neurotransmitters, BDNF/TrkB axis, and apoptosis-related markers were measured. The injection of Aβ1-42 induced cognitive dysfunction in AD rats. The integrity of brain tissue structure was destructed and apoptosis was induced in AD rats, in which was found the increased production of AChE and Aβ1-42, and decreased production of ChAT, ACH. At the molecular level, the expression of BDNF, TrkB, and Bcl-2 was suppressed, while the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 was induced. After the administration of CS, the memory and learning abilities of rats were improved, the production of neurotransmitter was restored, ordered arrangement of pyramidal cells was retained, and neuron apoptosis was inhibited. The attenuation of Aβ1-42-indcued impairments was associated with the activation of BDNF/TrkB axis and blockade of apoptosis-related pathways. Collectively, CS can improve learning and memory abilities in Aβ1-42-induced AD model rats. which may depend on the activation of the hippocampal BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.\n",
      "Cell death is a fundamental physiological process in all living organisms. Processes such as embryonic development, organ formation, tissue growth, organismal immunity, and drug response are accompanied by cell death. In recent years with the development of electron microscopy as well as biological techniques, especially the discovery of novel death modes such as ferroptosis, cuprotosis, alkaliptosis, oxeiptosis, and disulfidptosis, researchers have been promoted to have a deeper understanding of cell death modes. In this systematic review, we examined the current understanding of modes of cell death, including the recently discovered novel death modes. Our analysis highlights the common and unique pathways of these death modes, as well as their impact on surrounding cells and the organism as a whole. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on cell death, with a focus on identifying gaps in our knowledge and opportunities for future investigation. We also presented a new insight for macroscopic intracellular survival patterns, namely that intracellular molecular homeostasis is central to the balance of different cell death modes, and this viewpoint can be well justified by the signaling crosstalk of different death modes. These concepts can facilitate the future research about cell death in clinical diagnosis, drug development, and therapeutic modalities.\n",
      "Neurological disorders pose significant challenges in terms of treatment options, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Trigonelline, a naturally occurring alkaloid found in various plants, has emerged as a potential treatment option. It has also been reported that trigonelline is involved in several pathways like; Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant, Inflammatory, Neuroprotection and Neurotrophic, Mitochondrial Function and Energy Metabolism. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of trigonelline for diverse neurological disorders using a molecular docking approach. Molecular docking simulations were performed to predict the binding affinity and interaction between trigonelline and target proteins implicated in neurological disorders. The structural requirements for effective binding were also explored. The molecular docking results revealed strong binding interactions and favorable binding affinities between trigonelline and the target proteins involved in diverse neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and depression etc. The predicted binding modes provided insights into the key molecular interactions governing the ligand-protein complexes. The findings suggest that trigonelline holds promise as a therapeutic approach for several neurological disorders. The molecular docking approach employed in this study provides a valuable tool for rational drug design and optimization of trigonelline-based compounds. Further experimental validation and preclinical studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy and safety of trigonelline as a potential treatment option, paving the way for the development of more effective and targeted therapies for neurological disorders.\n",
      "Lymphatic system defects are involved in a wide range of diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Fluid return through the lymphatic vascular system is primarily provided by contractions of muscle cells in the walls of lymphatic vessels, which are in turn driven by electrochemical oscillations that cause rhythmic action potentials and associated surges in intracellular calcium ion concentration. There is an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms involved in these repeated events, restricting the development of pharmacological treatments for dysfunction. Previously, we proposed a model where autonomous oscillations in the membrane potential (M-clock) drove passive oscillations in the calcium concentration (C-clock). In this paper, to model more accurately what is known about the underlying physiology, we extend this model to the case where the M-clock and the C-clock oscillators are both active but coupled together, thus both driving the action potentials. This extension results from modifications to the model's description of the IP3 receptor, a key C-clock mechanism. The synchronised dual-driving clock behaviour enables the model to match IP3 receptor knock-out data, thus resolving an issue with previous models. We also use phase-plane analysis to explain the mechanisms of coupling of the dual clocks. The model has the potential to help determine mechanisms and find targets for pharmacological treatment of some causes of lymphoedema.\n",
      "Hippocampal hyperexcitability is a promising therapeutic target to prevent Aβ deposition in AD since enhanced neuronal activity promotes presynaptic Aβ production and release. This article highlights the potential application of perampanel (PER), an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist approved for partial seizures, as a therapeutic agent for AD. Using transgenic AD mice combined with in vivo brain microdialysis and primary neurons under oligomeric Aβ-evoked neuronal hyperexcitability, the acute effects of PER on Aβ metabolism were investigated. A single oral administration of PER rapidly decreased ISF Aβ\n",

      "We analyzed MRI scans to define the sporadic EOAD-signature atrophy in a small sample (n = 25) of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) EOAD patients, investigated its reproducibility in the large longitudinal early-onset Alzheimer's disease study (LEADS) sample (n = 211), and investigated the relationship of the magnitude of atrophy with cognitive impairment.\n",
      "The EOAD-signature atrophy was replicated across the two cohorts, with prominent atrophy in the caudal lateral temporal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and posterior cingulate and precuneus cortices, and with relative sparing of the medial temporal lobe. The magnitude of EOAD-signature atrophy was associated with the severity of cognitive impairment.\n",
      "The EOAD-signature atrophy is a reliable and clinically valid biomarker of AD-related neurodegeneration that could be used in clinical trials for EOAD.\n",

      "Dementia is one of today's greatest public health challenges. Its high socio-economic impact and difficulties in diagnosis and treatment are of increasing concern to an aging world population. In recent years, the study of the relationship between gut microbiota and different neurocognitive disorders has gained a considerable interest. Several studies have reported associations between gut microbiota dysbiosis and some types of dementia. Probiotics have been suggested to restore dysbiosis and to improve neurocognitive symptomatology in these dementias. Based on these previous findings, the available scientific evidence on the gut microbiota in humans affected by the most prevalent dementias, as well as the probiotic trials conducted in these patients in recent years, have been here reviewed. Decreased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and other bacterial metabolites appear to play a major role in the onset of neurocognitive symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD). Increased abundance of proinflammatory taxa could be closely related to the more severe clinical symptoms in both, as well as in Lewy Bodies dementia. Important lack of information was noted in Frontotemporal dementia behavioral variant. Moreover, geographical differences in the composition of the gut microbiota have been reported in AD. Some potential beneficial effects of probiotics in AD and PDD have been reported. However, due to the controversial results further investigations are clearly necessary.\n",
      "GPCRs are a family of transmembrane receptors that are profoundly linked to various neurological disorders, among which is Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is the second most ubiquitous neurological disorder after Alzheimer's disease, characterized by the depletion of dopamine in the central nervous system due to the impairment of dopaminergic neurons, leading to involuntary movements or dyskinesia. The current standard of care for PD is Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, yet the chronic use of this agent can exacerbate motor symptoms. Recent studies have investigated the effects of combining A2AR antagonist and 5-HT1A agonist on dyskinesia and motor complications in animal models of PD. It has been proved that the drug combination has significantly improved involuntary movements while maintaining motor activity, highlighting as a result new lines of therapy for PD treatments, through the regulation of both receptors. Using a combination of ligand-based pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulation, this study intends on identifying potential dual-target compounds from IBScreen. Results showed that the selected models displayed good enrichment metrics with a near perfect receiver operator characteristic (ROC) and Area under the accumulation curve (AUAC) values, signifying that the models are both specific and sensitive. Molecular docking and ADMET analysis revealed that STOCK2N-00171 could be potentially active against A2AR and 5-HT1A. Post-MD analysis confirmed that the ligand exhibits a stable behavior throughout the simulation while maintaining crucial interactions. These results imply that STOCK2N-00171 can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel and effective dual-acting ligands targeting A2AR and 5-HT1A.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.\n",
      "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly escalated into a global pandemic that primarily affects older and immunocompromised individuals due to underlying clinical conditions and suppressed immune responses. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients exhibit a spectrum of neurological symptoms, indicating that COVID-19 can affect the brain in a variety of manners. Many studies, past and recent, suggest a connection between viral infections and an increased risk of neurodegeneration, raising concerns about the neurological effects of COVID-19 and the possibility that it may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset or worsen already existing AD pathology through inflammatory processes given that both COVID-19 and AD share pathological features and risk factors. This leads us to question whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for AD and how these two conditions might influence each other. Considering the extensive reach of the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating impact of the ongoing AD pandemic, their combined effects could have significant public health consequences worldwide.\n",

      "Insulin resistance underlies Alzheimer's disease (AD) by affecting neuroinflammation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Here, we evaluated the effect of early and late-start abscisic acid (ABA) intervention on hippocampal BDNF, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and insulin receptors substrates (IRS) 1/2 mRNA levels in a triple-transgenic mice model of AD. Transgenic mice displayed lower BDNF and IRS2, equal IRS1, and higher TNFα expression compared to wild-type mice. Late ABA treatment could rescue TNFα and increased IRS1/2 expression. However, early ABA administration was required to increase BDNF expression. Our data suggests that early intervention with ABA can prevent AD, via rescuing IRS1/2 and BDNF expression.\n",

      "We included 1,514 cases from three cohorts, ADNI, AIBL, and DELCODE, spanning the range from cognitively normal people to people with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used generalized Bayesian mixed effects analysis of linear and polynomial models of amyloid and volume effects in time. Robustness of effects across cohorts was determined using Bayesian random effects meta-analysis.\n",
      "We found a consistent effect of amyloid and hippocampus volume, but not of basal forebrain volume, on rates of memory change across the three cohorts in the meta-analysis. Effects for amyloid and volumetric markers on executive function were more heterogeneous. We found practice effects in memory and executive performance in amyloid negative cognitively normal controls and MCI cases, but only to a smaller degree in amyloid positive controls and not at all in amyloid positive MCI cases.\n",
      "We found heterogeneity between cohorts, particularly in effects on executive functions. Initial increases in cognitive performance in amyloid negative, but not in amyloid positive MCI cases and controls may reflect practice effects from repeated testing that are lost with higher levels of cerebral amyloid.\n",
      "The TgF344-AD ratline represents a transgenic animal model of Alzheimer's disease. We previously reported spatial memory impairment in TgF344-AD rats, yet the underlying mechanism remained unknown. We, therefore, set out to determine if spatial memory impairment in TgF344-AD rats is attributed to spatial disorientation. Also, we aimed to investigate whether TgF344-AD rats exhibit signs of asymmetry in hemispheric neurodegeneration, similar to what is reported in spatially disoriented AD patients. Finally, we sought to examine how spatial disorientation correlates with working memory performance.\n",

Additionally, we compared our results to tangled AD neuron microarray-based study and the Allen Brain Atlas.\n",
      "We identified impaired neuron function in EC, MTG, PC, and VCX resulting from REST activation and reversal of mature neurons to a precursor-like state in EC, MTG, and SFG linked to SOX2 activation. Additionally, decreased neuron function and increased dedifferentiation were linked to the activation of SUZ12. Energetic deficit connected to NRF1 inactivation was found in HC, PC, and VCX.\n",

      "Dementia currently affects more than 55 million people worldwide, and scientists predict that this number will continue to rise. The most common form is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is triggered, among other things, by dysfunctional cells in the human brain. Stem cell research attempts to counteract neurodegenerative processes, for example by replacing or treating diseased cells. In addition to human embryonic stem cells, since the successes of Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006, there has been an increased focus on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS cells). These cells avoid ethically challenging questions about the moral status of human embryos, but there are numerous problems, such as high production costs, side effects from the reprogramming process, or a potentially new moral status. These ethical issues will be examined primarily in relation to AD. The first part will be a discussion of hiPS cells and their importance for stem cell research, after which the focus turns to AD. Based on scientific studies, the relationship between hiPS cells and AD will be outlined as well as ethical implications presented. While potential limitations of hiPS cells have been discussed by numerous authors, an ethical perspective on the link between hiPS cells and AD seems to be neglected in the scientific community. The following risk analysis aims to identify a possible research agenda. In conclusion, the focus on individuals with AD may help to adopt an ethical stance that recognizes existing limitations and constructively engages with the possibilities of research.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder leading to a decline in cognitive function and mental health. Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of Alzheimer's patients and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of Alzheimer's symptoms. To understand the involvement of Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from Alzheimer's patients decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that Alzheimer's symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in Alzheimer's.\n",

We also found that ZnO NPs significantly enhance the C. elegan's lifespan, locomotion, pharyngeal pumping, chemotaxis behavior also diminish the ROS deposition and intracellular productionMoreover, thioflavin T staining demonstrated that ZnO NPs substantially attenuated the Aβ deposition in the C. elegans strain as compared to untreated worms. With their antioxidant properties, the greenly synthesized ZnO NPs had a significant neuroprotective efficiency on Aβ-induced toxicity by reducing Aβ aggregation and specifically reducing the progression of paralysis in the C. elegans AD model.

      "Alzheimer's disease involves accumulating amyloid (A) and tau (T) pathology, and progressive neurodegeneration (N), leading to the development of the AD clinical syndrome. While several markers of N have been proposed, efforts to define normal vs. abnormal neurodegeneration based on neuroimaging have been limited. Sensitive markers that may account for or predict cognitive dysfunction for individuals in early disease stages are critical.\n",
      "Participants (n = 296) defined on A and T status and spanning the AD-clinical continuum underwent multi-shell diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to generate Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) metrics, which were tested as markers of N. To better define N, we developed age- and sex-adjusted robust z-score values to quantify normal and AD-associated (abnormal) neurodegeneration in both cortical gray matter and subcortical white matter regions of interest. We used general logistic regression with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analysis to test whether NODDI metrics improved diagnostic accuracy compared to models that only relied on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A and T status (alone and in combination).\n",
      "Using internal robust norms, we found that NODDI metrics correlate with worsening cognitive status and that NODDI captures early, AD neurodegenerative pathology in the gray matter of cognitively unimpaired, but A/T biomarker-positive, individuals. NODDI metrics utilized together with A and T status improved diagnostic prediction accuracy of AD clinical status, compared with models using CSF A and T status alone.\n",
      "Using a robust norms approach, we show that abnormal AD-related neurodegeneration can be detected among cognitively unimpaired individuals. Metrics derived from diffusion-weighted imaging are potential sensitive markers of N and could be considered for trial enrichment and as outcomes in clinical trials. However, given the small sample sizes, the exploratory nature of the work must be acknowledged.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex genetic disease, and variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only part of its heritability. Epistasis has been proposed as a major contributor to this 'missing heritability', however, many current methods are limited to only modelling additive effects. We use VariantSpark, a machine learning approach to GWAS, and BitEpi, a tool for epistasis detection, to identify AD associated variants and interactions across two independent cohorts, ADNI and UK Biobank. By incorporating significant epistatic interactions, we captured 10.41% more phenotypic variance than logistic regression (LR). We validate the well-established AD loci, APOE, and identify two novel genome-wide significant AD associated loci in both cohorts, SH3BP4 and SASH1, which are also in significant epistatic interactions with APOE. We show that the SH3BP4 SNP has a modulating effect on the known pathogenic APOE SNP, demonstrating a possible protective mechanism against AD. SASH1 is involved in a triplet interaction with pathogenic APOE SNP and ACOT11, where the SASH1 SNP lowered the pathogenic interaction effect between ACOT11 and APOE. Finally, we demonstrate that VariantSpark detects disease associations with 80% fewer controls than LR, unlocking discoveries in well annotated but smaller cohorts.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has entered a new era with the recent positive phase 3 clinical trials of the anti-Aβ antibodies lecanemab and donanemab. Why did it take 30 years to achieve these successes? Developing potent therapies for reducing fibrillar amyloid was key, as was selection of patients at relatively early stages of disease. Biomarkers of the target pathologies, including amyloid and tau PET, and insights from past trials were also critical to the recent successes. Moving forward, the challenge will be to develop more efficacious therapies with greater efficiency. Novel trial designs, including combination therapies and umbrella and basket protocols, will accelerate clinical development. Better diversity and inclusivity of trial participants are needed, and blood-based biomarkers may help to improve access for medically underserved groups. Incentivizing innovation in both academia and industry through public-private partnerships, collaborative mechanisms, and the creation of new career paths will be critical to build momentum in these exciting times.\n",
      "Many clinical studies reported the coexistence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), but the common molecular signature between AD and MS remains elusive. The purpose of our study is to explore the genetic linkage between AD and MS through bioinformatic analysis, providing new insights into the shared signatures and possible pathogenesis of two diseases.\n",
      "The common differential expressed genes (DEGs) were determined between AD and MS from datasets obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Further, functional and pathway enrichment analysis, PPI network construction, and identification of hub genes were carried out.

      "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Ageing is considered to be the greatest risk factor for PD, with a complex interplay between genetics and the environment. With population ageing, the prevalence of PD is expected to escalate worldwide; thus, it is of utmost importance to reduce the burden of PD. To date, there are no therapies to cure the disease, and current treatment strategies focus on the management of symptoms. Older adults often have multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes, which further complicates the management of PD. Healthcare systems and care models necessary to address the broad needs of older PD patients are largely unavailable. In this New Horizon article, we discuss various aspects of PD from an ageing perspective, including disease management. We highlight recent advancements in PD therapies and discuss new care models with the potential to improve patient's quality of life.\n",
      "Numerous Aβ proteoforms, identified in the human brain, possess differential neurotoxic and aggregation propensities. These proteoforms contribute in unknown ways to the conformations and resultant pathogenicity of oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifestation owing to the lack of molecular-level specificity to the exact chemical composition of underlying protein products with widespread interrogating techniques, like immunoassays. We evaluated Aβ proteoform flux using quantitative top-down mass spectrometry (TDMS) in a well-studied 5xFAD mouse model of age-dependent Aβ-amyloidosis. Though the brain-derived Aβ proteoform landscape is largely occupied by Aβ1-42, 25 different forms of Aβ with differential solubility were identified. These proteoforms fall into three natural groups defined by hierarchical clustering of expression levels in the context of mouse age and proteoform solubility, with each group sharing physiochemical properties associated with either N/C-terminal truncations or both. Overall, the TDMS workflow outlined may hold tremendous potential for investigating proteoform-level relationships between insoluble fibrils and soluble Aβ, including low-molecular-weight oligomers hypothesized to serve as the key drivers of neurotoxicity. Similarly, the workflow may also help to validate the utility of AD-relevant animal models to recapitulate amyloidosis mechanisms or possibly explain disconnects observed in therapeutic efficacy in animal models vs humans.\n",
      "Multimodal imaging (MMI) has emerged as a powerful tool in clinical research, combining different imaging modes to acquire comprehensive information and enabling scientists and surgeons to study tissue identification, localization, metabolic activity, and molecular discovery, thus aiding in disease progression analysis. While multimodal instruments are gaining popularity, challenges such as non-standardized characteristics, custom software, inadequate commercial support, and integration issues with other instruments need to be addressed. The field of multimodal imaging or multiplexed imaging allows for simultaneous signal reproduction from multiple imaging strategies. Intraoperatively, MMI can be integrated into frameless stereotactic surgery. Recent developments in medical imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Topography (PET) have brought new perspectives to multimodal imaging, enabling early cancer detection, molecular tracking, and real-time progression monitoring. Despite the evidence supporting the role of MMI in surgical decision-making, there is a need for comprehensive studies to validate and perform integration at the intersection of multiple imaging technologies. They were integrating mass spectrometry-based technologies (e.g., imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), imaging mass cytometry (IMC), and Ion mobility mass spectrometry ((IM-IM) with medical imaging modalities, offering promising avenues for molecular discovery and clinical applications. This review emphasizes the potential of multi-omics approaches in tissue mapping using MMI integrated into desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), allowing for sequential analyses of the same section. By addressing existing knowledge gaps, this review encourages future research endeavors toward multi-omics approaches, providing a roadmap for future research and enhancing the value of MMI in molecular pathology for diagnosis.\n",

A therapeutic strategy consists of the recruitment of these intermediates, thus preventing aberrant interaction with membrane components (lipids and receptors), which in turn may trigger a cascade of cellular disequilibria.

      "Of 796 505 patients included in the study (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 80.2 [8.3] years; 448 869 (56.4%) female), 209 245 had dementia, whereas 587 260 did not, across 7 824 616 person-years. The relative risk of psychiatric disorders was consistently higher among patients with dementia compared with control participants and began to increase from 3 years before diagnosis (hazard ratio, [HR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.67-1.76), peaked during the week after diagnosis (HR, 4.74; 95% CI, 4.21-5.34), and decreased rapidly thereafter. Decreased risk relative to controls was observed from 5 years after diagnosis (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98). The results were similar for Alzheimer disease, mixed dementia, vascular dementia and unspecified dementia. Among patients with dementia, markedly elevated use of psychiatric medications was observed in the year leading up to the dementia diagnosis and peaked 6 months after diagnosis. For example, antidepressant use was persistently higher among patients with dementia compared with controls, and the difference increased from 2 years before dementia diagnosis (15.9% vs 7.9%, P < .001), peaked approximately 6 months after dementia diagnosis (29.1% vs 9.7%, P < .001), and then decreased slowly from 3 years after diagnosis but remained higher than controls 5 years after diagnosis (16.4% vs 6.9%, P < .001).\n",

      "At the beginning of the follow-up, the sample of 109 218 participants had a mean (SD) age of 57.7 (5.5) years, 56 474 participants (51.7%) were female, and 52 744 (48.3%) were male. During follow-up, 730 participants (0.7%) received a diagnosis of adult ADHD, and 7726 (7.1%) received a diagnosis of dementia. Dementia occurred among 96 of 730 participants (13.2%) with adult ADHD and 7630 of 108 488 participants (7.0%) without adult ADHD. In the primary analysis, compared with the absence of adult ADHD, the presence of adult ADHD was statistically significantly (P < .001) associated with an increased dementia risk (unadjusted HR, 3.62 [95% CI, 2.92-4.49; P < .001]; adjusted HR, 2.77 [95% CI, 2.11-3.63; P < .001]).

      "Alzheimer's disease contributes to 60-70% of all dementia cases in the general population. Belonging to the BIN1/amphiphysin/RVS167 (BAR) superfamily, the bridging integrator (BIN1) has been identified to impact two major pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD), i.e., amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau accumulation. Aβ accumulation is found to increase by BIN1 knockdown in cortical neurons in late-onset AD, due to BACE1 accumulation at enlarged early endosomes. Two BIN1 mutants, KR and PL, were identified to exhibit Aβ accumulation. Furthermore, BIN1 deficiency by BIN1-related polymorphisms impairs the interaction with tau, thus elevating tau phosphorylation, altering synapse structure and tau function. Even though the precise role of BIN1 in the neuronal tissue needs further investigation, the authors aim to throw light on the potential of BIN1 and unfold its implications on tau and Aβ pathology, to aid AD researchers across the globe to examine BIN1, as an appropriate target gene for disease management.\n",
      "Oligomeric aggregates of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide have been implicated as the toxic species for Alzheimer's disease by contributing to oxidative cytotoxicity and physical disruption in cell membranes in the brain. Recent evidence points to the ability of the catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine in the presence of copper ions to both stabilize oligomers and decrease the toxic effects of these oligomers. Based on these results, physical characterization of aggregates and subsequent cell studies with a neuroblastoma line were performed that show both dopamine and the related neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, can stabilize oligomers and decrease toxicity of Aβ aggregates without copper present. To investigate this reduction of toxicity, structural characterization of oligomers in the presence of neurotransmitters was compared to aggregates formed with Aβ alone. Gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy show higher levels of oligomers in the presence of dopamine and norepinephrine, yet the oligomer structure is largely amorphous. Aβ aggregated alone forms the predicted highly organized fibrillar species, with increased levels of dityrosine covalent linkages, which are largely absent in the presence of the neurotransmitters. A proposed mechanism for the observed decrease in cell death by Aβ in the presence of dopamine and norepinephrine suggests the neurotransmitters both block the formation of organized oligomer structures and dityrosine stabilizing linkages while also behaving as antioxidants, providing a dual mechanism for increased cell viability.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with multifaceted neuropathological disorders. AD is characterized by intracellular accumulation of phosphorylated tau proteins and extracellular deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Various protease enzymes, including neprilysin (NEP), are concerned with the degradation and clearance of Aβ. Indeed, a defective neuronal clearance pathway due to the dysfunction of degradation enzymes might be a possible mechanism for the accumulation of Aβ and subsequent progression of AD neuropathology. NEP is one of the most imperative metalloproteinase enzymes involved in the clearance of Aβ. This review aimed to highlight the possible role of NEP inhibitors in AD. The combination of sacubitril and valsartan which is called angiotensin receptor blocker and NEP inhibitor (ARNI) may produce beneficial and deleterious effects on AD neuropathology. NEP inhibitors might increase the risk of AD by the inhibition of Aβ clearance, and increase brain bradykinin (BK) and natriuretic peptides (NPs), which augment the pathogenesis of AD. These verdicts come from animal model studies, though they may not be applied to humans. However, clinical studies revealed promising safety findings regarding the use of ARNI. Moreover, NEP inhibition increases various neuroprotective peptides involved in inflammation, glucose homeostasis and nerve conduction. Also, NEP inhibitors may inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) expression, ameliorating insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels. These findings proposed that NEP inhibitors may have a protective effect against AD development by increasing GLP-1, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and substance P, and deleterious effects by increasing brain BK. Preclinical and clinical studies are recommended in this regard.\n",

Patients underwent neuropsychological testing and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance imaging data sets were analyzed regarding the presence of CAA-related MRI biomarkers to determine CAA prevalence. ANOVAs were used to investigate the contribution of CAA to cognitive impairment within diagnostic groups and to determine whether differences in cognitive test performance between the diagnostic groups are mediated by total CAA burden.\n",
      "475 patients (222 male, 253 female) with SMI (n = 47), naMCI (n = 41), aMCI (n = 189), early AD (n = 9), AD (n = 114), MD (n = 71) and VD (n = 4) were included. Mean age was 73.2 (9.9) years. CAA prevalence was 14.9% in SMI, 14.6% in naMCI, 24.3% in aMCI, 22.2% in early onset AD, 18.4% in late onset AD, 46.5% in MD and 25% in VD. Patients with possible and probable CAA were older than patients without CAA. In particular, diagnosis of aMCI, early onset AD, MD and VD showed high CAA prevalence. In AD but not in aMCI, CAA diagnosis significantly influenced test performance in the CERAD word list recall (F (1,78) = 4505; p = 0.037; partial eta-square = 0.055). Differences in cognitive test performance between the diagnostic groups of naMCI, aMCI, AD and MD were mediated by total CAA burden within AAT simply nouns subtest (F (2,39) = 4059; p = 0.025; partial eta-square = 0.172) and in CERAD verbal fluency test (F (3,129) = 3533; p = 0.017; partial eta-square = 0.076).\n",
      "This retrospective analysis demonstrates high prevalence rates of CAA in cognitive diagnoses. Our data suggest that comorbid CAA independently impacts cognitive test performance in the course of AD with presumably stage-dependent effects. Especially in patients with AD comorbid CAA additionally impairs memory function. Total CAA small vessel disease burden further modulates psychometric differences in cognitive test performance between diagnostic groups regarding word finding and word fluency capabilities.\n",
      "About two-thirds of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients are women, who exhibit more severe pathology and cognitive decline than men. Whether biological sex causally modulates the relationship between cholinergic signaling and amyloid pathology remains unknown.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent forms of dementia in older individuals. Convergent evidence suggests structural connectome abnormalities in specific brain regions are linked to AD progression. The biological basis underpinnings of these connectome changes, however, have remained elusive. We utilized an individual regional mean connectivity strength (RMCS) derived from a regional radiomics similarity network to capture altered morphological connectivity in 1654 participants (605 normal controls, 766 mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 283 AD). Then, we also explored the biological basis behind these morphological changes through gene enrichment analysis and cell-specific analysis. We found that RMCS probes of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe were significantly altered in AD and MCI, with these differences being spatially related to the expression of AD-risk genes. In addition, gene enrichment analysis revealed that the modulation of chemical synaptic transmission is the most relevant biological process associated with the altered RMCS in AD. Notably, neuronal cells were found to be the most pertinent cells in the altered RMCS. Our findings shed light on understanding the biological basis of structural connectome changes in AD, which may ultimately lead to more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.\n",

      "Fifteen studies showed that oestrogen-only therapy effectively reduced the risk of Alzheimer's disease, whereas nine showed no correlation. Studies also investigated oestrogen-related variables such as length of oestrogen exposure, being an apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and their role in neuroprotection. This review was limited by the limited ranges of duration of oestrogen treatment and type of oestrogen-only therapy used. In conclusion, oestrogen-only therapy has potential for use in preventing Alzheimer's disease, although current evidence is inconclusive and requires further study.\n",

None of the respondents were familiar with Montreal cognitive assessment, or any form of tablet-based cognitive assessment tool. Most (86%) knew about the mini mental state examination.\n",
      "Primary healthcare providers are deficient in knowledge of dementia Alzheimer's or cognitive assessment tools, and so they do not routinely carryout cognitive screening in elderly patients during clinic visits. It is important to train all cadres of primary healthcare staff on the use and benefit of cognitive assessment using culturally validated user-friendly tool to improve quality of care for the elderly population.\n",
      "Dementia represents a growing public health burden with large social, racial, and ethnic disparities. The etiology of dementia is poorly understood, and the lack of robust biomarkers in diverse, population-representative samples is a barrier to moving dementia research forward. Existing biomarkers and other pathology measures derived from neuropathology, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid samples, are commonly collected in predominantly White and highly-educated samples drawn from academic medical centers in urban settings. Blood-based biomarkers are non-invasive and less expensive, offering promise to expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of dementia, including in participants from historically-excluded groups. Although largely not yet FDA-approved or used in clinical settings, blood-based biomarkers are increasingly included in epidemiologic studies on dementia. Blood-based biomarkers in epidemiologic research may allow the field to more accurately understand the multifactorial etiology and sequence of events that characterize dementia-related pathophysiological changes. As blood-based dementia biomarkers continue to be developed and incorporated into research and practice, we outline considerations for using them in dementia epidemiology, and illustrate key concepts with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (2003-present) data. We focus on measurement, including both validity and reliability, and on the use of dementia blood-based biomarkers to promote equity in dementia research and cognitive aging.\n",
      "As a progressive neurological disease with increased morbidity and mortality, Alzheimer Disease (AD) is characterized by neuron damage that controls memory and mental functions. Enicostema axillare (EA), an herb with a history of combativeness and effectiveness in treating Rheumatoid Arthritis, Cancer, and Diabetes, is used in Indian folk medicine from a holistic point of view. Though the herb is used for many illnesses, the molecular mechanism of its bioactive on AD has not been deciphered by intricate research. A unique pharmacology approach based on ADME drug screening and targeting, pathway enrichment (GO and KEGG), and network pharmacology, was established to explore the molecular mechanisms of E. axillare (EA) bioactive compounds for the treatment of AD. In brief, we bring to light the three active compounds of EA and seven potential molecular targets of AD, which are mainly implicated in four signaling pathways, i.e., MAPK, Apoptosis, neurodegeneration, and the TNF pathway. Moreover, the network analysis of the active compounds, molecular targets, and their pathways reveals the pharmacological nature of the compounds. Further, molecular docking studies were carried out to explore the interactions between the EA bioactive compounds and the targets and examine the binding affinity. The outcome of the work reflects the potential therapeutic effects of the compounds for treating AD through the modulation of the key proteins, which further corroborates the reliability of our network pharmacology analysis. This study not only helps in understanding the molecular mechanism of the drugs but also helps in finding and sorting new drugs for the treatment of AD, and other complex diseases through modern medicine.\n",
      "While physical frailty has been recognized as a clinical entity for some time, the concept of cognitive frailty (CF) is now gaining increasing attention in the geriatrics research community. CF refers to the co-occurrence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment in older adults, which has been suggested as a potential precursor to both dementia and adverse physical outcomes. However, this condition represents a challenge for researchers and clinicians, as there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition and diagnostic criteria for CF, which has limited its utility. Here, using insights from both the physical frailty literature and cognitive science research, we describe emerging research on CF. We highlight areas of agreement as well as areas of confusion and remaining knowledge gaps, and provide our perspective on fine-tuning the current construct, aiming to stimulate further discussion in this developing field.\n",
      "The human body harbors a diverse ecosystem of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively known as the microbiota. Current research is increasingly focusing on the potential association between the microbiota and various neuropsychiatric disorders. The microbiota resides in various parts of the body, such as the oral cavity, nasal passages, lungs, gut, skin, bladder, and vagina. The gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract has received particular attention due to its high abundance and its potential role in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the microbiota presents in other body tissues, though less abundant, also plays crucial role in immune system and human homeostasis, thus influencing the development and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, oral microbiota imbalance and associated periodontitis might increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, studies using the postmortem brain samples have detected the widespread presence of oral bacteria in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This article provides an overview of the emerging role of the host microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders and discusses future directions, such as underlying biological mechanisms, reliable biomarkers associated with the host microbiota, and microbiota-targeted interventions, for research in this field.\n",
      "Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is an emerging biomarker of neuronal damage in several neurological disorders. Its association with cognitive function in the general US population aged 60 years and above is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between sNfL and cognitive function in the general US population aged 60 and above.\n",
      "The data were obtained from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which include 506 individuals aged 60 or older who met our search criteria. In our study, sNfL levels were divided into two groups based on dichotomization (19.0 pg/mL). After adjusting for multiple covariates, it was found that the high sNfL group (≥ 19.0 pg/mL) had lower cognitive performance than the low sNfL group (< 19.0 pg/mL). This relationship was also stable in subgroup analysis.\n",
      "In this sample of an American elderly population, higher sNfL levels are correlated with lower cognitive performance. Our findings suggest that sNfL may become a potential screening tool for early prediction and confirmation of cognitive damage.\n",
      "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a major player in the oxygen sensor system as well as a transcription factor. HIF-1 is also associated in the pathogenesis of many brain diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), epilepsy and stroke. HIF-1 regulates the expression of many genes such as those involved in glycolysis, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and proliferation in hypoxic condition. Despite several studies, the mechanism through which HIF-1 confers neuroprotection remains unclear, one of them is modulating metabolic profiles and inflammatory pathways. Characterization of the neuroprotective role of HIF-1 may be through its stabilization and the regulation of target genes that aid in the early adaptation to the oxidative stressors. It is interesting to note that mounting data from recent years point to an additional crucial regulatory role for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in inflammation. HIFs in immune cells regulate the production of glycolytic energy as well as innate immunity, pro-inflammatory gene expression, and mediates activation of pro-survival pathways. The present review highlights the contribution of HIF-1 to neuroprotection where inflammation is the crucial factor in the pathogenesis contributing to neural death. The potential mechanisms that contribute to neuroprotection as a result of the downstream targets of HIF-1α are discussed. Such mechanisms include those mediated through IL-10, an anti-inflammatory molecule involved in activating pro-survival signaling mechanisms via AKT/ERK and JAK/STAT pathways.\n",
      "Previous observational studies focused on the association of coffee consumption and neurological disease. However, it is not known whether these associations are causal.\n",
      "We used Mendelian randomization (MR) study to assess the causal relationship of coffee intake with the risk of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, and migraine. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which had genetic statistical significance with coffee intake were used as instrumental variable (IV). Genetic instruments were stretched from the MRC-IEU (MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit) analysis on the UK Biobank. We performed MR analyses using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the main approach. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO to assess the robustness.\n",
      "In the MR analysis, 40 SNPs were selected as IV, the F statistics for all SNPs ranged from 16 to 359. In IVW approach, our results provide genetic evidence supporting a potential causal association between coffee intake and a lower risk of migraine (OR = 0.528, 95% CI = 0.342-0.817, P = 0.004) and migraine with aura (OR = 0.374, 95% CI = 0.208-0.672, P = 0.001). However, we found no significant association between coffee intake and other neurological diseases along with their subtypes in this MR study.\n",
      "Using genetic data, our MR study found significant evidence supporting a causal association between coffee intake and migraine. This suggests that coffee consumption is likely a trigger or a prevention strategy for migraine.\n",
      "Episodic memory is memory for experiences within a specific temporal and spatial context. Episodic memories decline early in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recollection of episodic memories can fail with both AD and aging, but familiarity and recollection memory uniquely fail in AD. Finding a means to differentiate specific memory failures in animal models is critical for translational research. Four cotton top tamarins participated in an object recognition test. They were exposed to two unique objects placed in a consistent context for 5 daily sessions. Next a delay of 1 day or 1 week was imposed. Subjects' memory of the objects was tested by replacing one of the familiarized objects with a novel one. The tamarins looked longer at the novel object after both delays, an indication of remembering the familiar object. In other tests, the test pair was relocated to a new location or presented at a different time of day. With context changes, tamarins showed greater interest in the novel object after a 1-week delay but not after a 1-day delay. It seems that context changes disrupted their recollection of recent events. But the monkeys showed accurate familiarity memory across context changes with longer delays.\n",
      "Despite advances in precision oncology, cancer remains a global public health issue. In this report, proof-of-principle evidence is presented that a cell-penetrable peptide (ACP52C) dissociates transcription factor CP2c complexes and induces apoptosis in most CP2c oncogene-addicted cancer cells through transcription activity-independent mechanisms. CP2cs dissociated from complexes directly interact with and degrade YY1, leading to apoptosis via the MDM2-p53 pathway. The liberated CP2cs also inhibit TDP2, causing intrinsic genome-wide DNA strand breaks and subsequent catastrophic DNA damage responses. These two mechanisms are independent of cancer driver mutations but are hindered by high MDM2 p60 expression. However, resistance to ACP52C mediated by MDM2 p60 can be sensitized by CASP2 inhibition. Additionally, derivatives of ACP52C conjugated with fatty acid alone or with a CASP2 inhibiting peptide show improved pharmacokinetics and reduced cancer burden, even in ACP52C-resistant cancers. This study enhances the understanding of ACP52C-induced cancer-specific apoptosis induction and supports the use of ACP52C in anticancer drug development.\n",

      "The advent of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson's disease 30 years ago has ushered a global breakthrough of DBS as a universal method for therapy and research in wide areas of neurology and psychiatry. The literature of the last three decades has described numerous concepts and practices of DBS, often branded as novelties or discoveries. However, reading the contemporary publications often elicits a sense of déjà vu in relation to several methods, attributes, and practices of DBS. Here, we review various applications and techniques of the modern-era DBS and compare them with practices of the past.\n",
      "Compared with modern literature, publications of the old-era functional stereotactic neurosurgery, including old-era DBS, show that from the very beginning multidisciplinarity and teamwork were often prevalent and insisted upon, ethical concerns were recognized, brain circuitries and rational for brain targets were discussed, surgical indications were similar, closed-loop stimulation was attempted, evaluations of surgical results were debated, and controversies were common. Thus, it appears that virtually everything done today in the field of DBS bears resemblance to old-time practices, or has been done before, albeit with partly other tools and techniques. Movement disorders remain the main indications for modern DBS as was the case for lesional surgery and old-era DBS. The novelties today consist of the STN as the dominant target for DBS, the tremendous advances in computerized brain imaging, the sophistication and versatility of implantable DBS hardware, and the large potential for research.\n",
      "Many aspects of contemporary DBS bear strong resemblance to practices of the past. The dominant clinical indications remain movement disorders with virtually the same brain targets as in the past, with one exception: the STN. Other novel brain targets - that are so far subject to DBS trials - are the pedunculopontine nucleus for gait freezing, the anteromedial internal pallidum for Gilles de la Tourette and the fornix for Alzheimer's disease. The major innovations and novelties compared to the past concern mainly the unmatched level of research activity, its high degree of sponsorship, and the outstanding advances in technology that have enabled multimodal brain imaging and the miniaturization, versatility, and sophistication of implantable hardware. The greatest benefit for patients today, compared to the past, is the higher level of precision and safety of DBS, and of all functional stereotactic neurosurgery.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) threatens elderly human health and still lacks effective treatment. Our previous work showed that LGZGD possessed a neuroprotective effect on the Aβ\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition, is defined by neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, and gradual cognitive decline. Regardless of the advances in understanding AD's pathogenesis and progression, its causes are still contested, and there are currently no efficient therapies for the illness. The post-mortem analyses revealed widespread neuronal loss in multiple brain regions in AD, evidenced by a decrease in neuronal density and correlated with the disease's progression and cognitive deterioration. AD's neurodegeneration is complicated, and different types of neuronal cell death, alone or in combination, play crucial roles in this process. Recently, the involvement of non-apoptotic programmed cell death in the neurodegenerative mechanisms of AD has received a lot of attention. Aberrant activation of necroptosis and ferroptosis, two newly discovered forms of regulated non-apoptotic cell death, is thought to contribute to neuronal cell death in AD. In this review, we first address the main features of necroptosis and ferroptosis, cellular signaling cascades, and the mechanisms involved in AD pathology. Then, we discuss the latest therapies targeting necroptosis and ferroptosis in AD animal/cell models and human research to provide vital information for AD treatment.\n",
      "The aggregation of misfolded tau into neurotoxic fibrils is linked to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Disease-associated conformations of filamentous tau are characterized by hydrophobic interactions between side chains on unique and distant β-strand modules within each protomer. Here, we report the design and diversity-oriented synthesis of β-arch peptide macrocycles composed of the aggregation-prone PHF6 hexapeptide of tau and the cross-β module specific to the AD tau fold. Termed \"β-bracelets\", these proteomimetics assemble in a sequence- and macrocycle-dependent fashion, resulting in amyloid-like fibrils that feature in-register parallel β-sheet structure. Backbone N-amination of a selected β-bracelet affords soluble inhibitors of tau aggregation. We further demonstrate that the N-aminated macrocycles block the prion-like cellular seeding activity of recombinant tau as well as mature fibrils from AD patient extracts. These studies establish β-bracelets as a new class of cross-β epitope mimics and demonstrate their utility in the rational design of molecules targeting amyloid propagation and seeding.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and is accompanied by memory deficits, personality changes, anxiety, depression, and social difficulties. For treatment of AD, many researchers have attempted to find medicinal resources with high effectiveness and without side effects. Oligonol is a low molecular weight polypeptide derived from lychee fruit extract. We investigated the effects of oligonol in 5 × FAD transgenic AD mice, which developed severe amyloid pathology, through behavioral tests (Barnes maze, marble burying, and nestle shredding) and molecular experiments. Oligonol treatment attenuated blood glucose levels and increased the antioxidant response in the livers of 5 × FAD mice. Moreover, the behavioral score data showed improvements in anxiety, depressive behavior, and cognitive impairment following a 2-month course of orally administered oligonol. Oligonol treatment not only altered the circulating levels of cytokines and adipokines in 5 × FAD mice, but also significantly enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of antioxidant enzymes and synaptic plasticity in the brain cortex and hippocampus. Therefore, we highlight the therapeutic potential of oligonol to attenuate neuropsychiatric problems and improve memory deficits in the early stage of AD.\n",
      "Nomenclature in the field of neurodegenerative diseases presents a challenging problem. Inconsistent use of terms such as Alzheimer disease and dementia has compromised progress in clinical care, research, and development of therapeutics. Dementia-associated stigma further contributes to inconsistent and imprecise language. The result is a lack of clarity that produces confusion with patients and the general public and presents communication challenges among researchers. Therefore, the Advisory Council on Research, Care, and Services of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease authorized a committee to make recommendations for improvement.\n",

      "The Dementia Nomenclature Initiative organized into 3 major stakeholder working groups: clinicians, researchers, and the public (including individuals living with dementia and family caregivers). To inform the work, the initiative completed a narrative literature review of dementia nomenclature evolution over the last century across the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Scopus databases (January 1, 2000, through July 31, 2020). Initiative working groups used the results as a foundation for understanding current challenges with dementia nomenclature and implications for research, clinical practice, and public understanding. The initiative obtained additional input via focus groups with individuals living with dementia and caregivers, with separate groups for race and ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and White) as an initial assessment of the meaning of dementia-related terms to these groups.\n",
      "From working group deliberations, the literature review, and focus group input, the initiative developed a framework clearly separating the clinical syndromic presentation experienced by affected individuals from possible underlying pathophysiologies. In the framework, domains of clinical impairment, such as cognitive, behavioral, motor, and other neurologic features, are graded by level of impairment between none and severe. Next, biomarker information describes underlying disease processes, explains the syndrome, and identifies possible disease labels: Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, or vascular cognitive impairment dementia.\n",

Wider testing and refinement of the framework will subsequently improve the information used in communicating about cognitive impairment and the way in which the information is used in clinical, research, and public settings.\n",

      "This population-based cohort study included propensity score matching on national, longitudinal data using extensive baseline variables of sociodemographic characteristics, economic status, family availability, health conditions, disability status, and outpatient care use among 2 groups of US adults aged 55 years or older who did not have dementia. In total, 2387 adults experienced the onset of dementia during the 2-year follow-up (dementia group) and 2387 adults did not (control group). Participants were followed up for 8 years from the baseline. Data were analyzed from February 2021 to August 2023.\n",
      "Dementia determined based on Langa-Weir classification.\n",
      "Outcomes of care use included monthly care hours from family and unpaid helpers, in-home medical services, hospital stay, and nursing facility stay. Financial outcomes included out-of-pocket medical costs, wealth, and the status of having Medicaid.\n",
      "Among the full sample, the mean (SD) age was 75.4 [10.4] years, and 59.7% of participants were female. Care use was similar at baseline between the matched groups but was substantially greater for the dementia group vs control group in subsequent years, especially during the 2-year follow-up: 45 vs 13 monthly care hours from family and unpaid helpers, 548 of 2370 participants (23.1%) vs 342 of 2383 (14.4%) using in-home medical care, 1104 of 2369 (46.6%) vs 821 of 2377 (34.5%) with hospital stay, and 489 of 2375 (20.6%) vs 104 of 2384 (4.4%) using a nursing facility. The increase in use of a nursing facility was especially high if baseline family care availability was low. Over the 8-year follow-up in the dementia group, the 2-year out-of-pocket medical costs increased from $4005 to $10 006, median wealth was reduced from $79 339 to $30 490, and those enrolling in Medicaid increased from 379 of 2358 participants (16.1%) to 201 of 676 participants (29.7%). No statistically significant changes in financial outcomes were found in the control group.\n",

      "Increased white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume is a common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding in both autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) and late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), but it remains unclear whether increased WMH along the AD continuum is reflective of AD-intrinsic processes or secondary to elevated systemic vascular risk factors.\n",
      "To estimate the associations of neurodegeneration and parenchymal and vessel amyloidosis with WMH accumulation and investigate whether systemic vascular risk is associated with WMH beyond these AD-intrinsic processes.\n",
      "This cohort study used data from 3 longitudinal cohort studies conducted in tertiary and community-based medical centers-the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN; February 2010 to March 2020), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; July 2007 to September 2021), and the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS; September 2010 to December 2019).\n",
      "The main outcomes were the independent associations of neurodegeneration (decreases in gray matter volume), parenchymal amyloidosis (assessed by amyloid positron emission tomography), and vessel amyloidosis (evidenced by cerebral microbleeds [CMBs]) with cross-sectional and longitudinal WMH.\n",
      "Data from 3960 MRI sessions among 1141 participants were included: 252 pathogenic variant carriers from DIAN (mean [SD] age, 38.4 [11.2] years; 137 [54%] female), 571 older adults from ADNI (mean [SD] age, 72.8 [7.3] years; 274 [48%] female), and 318 older adults from HABS (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [7.6] years; 194 [61%] female). Longitudinal increases in WMH volume were greater in individuals with CMBs compared with those without (DIAN: t = 3.2 [P = .001]; ADNI: t = 2.7 [P = .008]), associated with longitudinal decreases in gray matter volume (DIAN: t = -3.1 [P = .002]; ADNI: t = -5.6 [P < .001]; HABS: t = -2.2 [P = .03]), greater in older individuals (DIAN: t = 6.8 [P < .001]; ADNI: t = 9.1 [P < .001]; HABS: t = 5.4 [P < .001]), and not associated with systemic vascular risk (DIAN: t = 0.7 [P = .40]; ADNI: t = 0.6 [P = .50]; HABS: t = 1.8 [P = .06]) in individuals with ADAD and LOAD after accounting for age, gray matter volume, CMB presence, and amyloid burden. In older adults without CMBs at baseline, greater WMH volume was associated with CMB development during longitudinal follow-up (Cox proportional hazards regression model hazard ratio, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.72-4.03; P < .001).\n",
      "The findings suggest that increased WMH volume in AD is associated with neurodegeneration and parenchymal and vessel amyloidosis but not with elevated systemic vascular risk. Additionally, increased WMH volume may represent an early sign of vessel amyloidosis preceding the emergence of CMBs.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing memory loss and cognitive decline, linked to amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein accumulation in the brain. Environmental pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) has been implicated in AD pathology due to its neurotoxic effects. This study aims to evaluate cyanidin from flower bracts of Musa acuminata Colla (red variety; AAA group) for its neuroprotective properties against BPA-induced AD pathology. The extraction of cyanidin was optimized using 70% ethanol in acidified water, showing promising anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. Cyanidin was effectively purified from the resultant extract and characterized using spectroscopic techniques. Two gradient doses of cyanidin (90 and 10 µg/ml) were determined based on cell viability assay. The role of cyanidin in promoting nerve growth and differentiation was assessed in PC12 cells for up to 72 h. A discernible and statistically significant difference was assessed in neurite extension at both doses at 72 h, followed by pre-treatment with cyanidin. BPA stimulation significantly increased the p-tau expression compared to the control (p < 0.0001). Pre-treatment with cyanidin reduced the tau expression; however, a significant difference was observed compared to control cells (p = 0.0003). Cyanidin significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of Wnt3a (p < 0.0001), β-catenin (p = 0.0004), and NeuroD1 (p = 0.0289), and decreased the expression of WIF1(p = 0.0040) and DKK1 (p < 0.0001), which are Wnt antagonist when compared to cells stimulated with BPA. Conclusively, our finding suggests that cyanidin could agonize nerve growth factor and promote neuronal differentiation, reduce tau-hyperphosphorylation by restoring the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, and thereby render its neuroprotective potential against BPA-induced AD pathology.\n",
      "Orexin and its receptors are closely related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the expression of orexin system genes under physiological condition has circadian rhythm, the diurnal characteristics of orexin system genes, and its potential role in the pathogenesis in AD are unknown. In the present study, we hope to elucidate the diurnal characteristics of orexin system genes at the early stage of AD, and to investigate its potential role in the development of AD neuropathology. We firstly detected the mRNA levels of orexin system genes, AD risk genes and core clock genes (CCGs) in hypothalamus and hippocampus in 6-month-old male 3xTg-AD mice and C57BL/6J (wild type, WT) control mice, then analyzed diurnal expression profiles of all genes using JTK_CYCLE algorithm, and did the correlation analysis between expression of orexin system genes and AD risk genes or CCGs. In addition, the expression of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein were measured. The results showed that the diurnal mRNA expression profiles of PPO, OX1R, OX2R, Bace2, Bmal1, Per1, Per2 and Cry1 in the hypothalamus, and gene expression of OX1R, OX2R, Bace1, Bmal1, Per1 and Cry2 in the hippocampus in 3xTg-AD mice were different from that in WT mice. Furthermore, there is positive correlation between orexin system genes and AD risk genes or CCGs in the brain in 3xTg-AD mice. In addition, the expression of Aβ and p-tau in hippocampus in 3xTg-AD mice were significantly increased, and the expression of p-tau is higher in night than in day. These results indicate that the abnormal expression profiles of orexin system genes and its interaction with AD risk genes or CCGs might exert important role in the pathogenesis of AD, which will increase the expression of Aβ and p-tau, and accelerate the development of AD.\n",

Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for early diagnosis of AD. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are also used for the amelioration of AD symptoms. In this systematic review, we reviewed the effect of different AChEIs including donepezil, rivastigmine, tacrine, physostigmine, and galantamine on EEG patterns in patients with AD.\n",

      "AChEIs can decrease beta, theta, and delta frequency bands in patients with AD. However, conflicting results were found for alpha band. Some studies have shown increased alpha frequency, while others have shown decreased alpha frequency following treatment with AChEIs. The only difference was the type of drug.\n",
      "We found that studies reporting the decreased alpha frequency used donepezil and galantamine, while studies reporting the increased alpha frequency used rivastigmine and tacrine. It was suggested that future studies should focus on the effect of different AChEIs on EEG bands, especially alpha frequency in patients with AD, to compare their effects and find the reason for their different influence on EEG patterns. Also, differences between the effects of AChEIs on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination may be another important factor. This is the first article investigating the effect of different AChEIs on EEG patterns in patients with AD.\n",
      "DNA damage causes genomic instability underlying many diseases, with traditional analytical approaches providing minimal insight into the spectrum of DNA lesions in vivo. Here we used untargeted chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry-based adductomics (LC-MS/MS) to begin to define the landscape of DNA modifications in rat and human tissues. A basis set of 114 putative DNA adducts was identified in heart, liver, brain, and kidney in 1-26-month-old rats and 111 in human heart and brain by 'stepped MRM' LC-MS/MS. Subsequent targeted analysis of these species revealed species-, tissue-, age- and sex-biases. Structural characterization of 10 selected adductomic signals as known DNA modifications validated the method and established confidence in the DNA origins of the signals. Along with strong tissue biases, we observed significant age-dependence for 36 adducts, including N2-CMdG, 5-HMdC and 8-Oxo-dG in rats and 1,N6-ϵdA in human heart, as well as sex biases for 67 adducts in rat tissues. These results demonstrate the potential of adductomics for discovering the true spectrum of disease-driving DNA adducts. Our dataset of 114 putative adducts serves as a resource for characterizing dozens of new forms of DNA damage, defining mechanisms of their formation and repair, and developing them as biomarkers of aging and disease.\n",

      "The molecular docking and visualizations showed that conformational change in resveratrol derivatives significantly influenced the parameter for docking results. Several types of interactions, including conventional hydrogen bonds, carbon-hydrogen bonds, Pi-donor hydrogen bonds, and Pi-Alkyl, were found via docking analysis of resveratrol derivatives and SIRT1 receptors. The possible activation effect of resveratrol 4'-(6-Galloylglucoside) with ZINC ID: ZINC230079516 with higher binding energy score (-46.8608 kJ/mol) to the catalytic domain (CD) of SIRT1 was achieved at the maximum value for SIRT1, as compared to resveratrol and its other derivatives.\n",
      "Finally, resveratrol 4'-(6-Galloylglucoside), as a derivative for resveratrol, has stably interacted with the CD of SIRT1 and might be a potential effective activator for SIRT1.\n",
      "High-throughput technologies and machine learning (ML), when applied to a huge pool of medical data such as omics data, result in efficient analysis. Recent research aims to apply and develop ML models to predict a disease well in time using available omics datasets. The present work proposed a framework, 'OmicPredict', deploying a hybrid feature selection method and deep neural network (DNN) model to predict multiple diseases using omics data. The hybrid feature selection method is developed using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique and firefly algorithm. The OmicPredict framework is applied to three case studies, Alzheimer's disease, Breast cancer, and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the case study of Alzheimer's disease, the framework predicts patients using GSE33000 and GSE44770 dataset. In the case study of Breast cancer, the framework predicts human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) subtype status using Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset. In the case study of COVID-19, the framework performs patients' classification using GSE157103 dataset. The experimental results show that DNN model achieved an Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 0.949 for the Alzheimer's (GSE33000 and GSE44770) dataset. Furthermore, it achieved an AUC score of 0.987 and 0.989 for breast cancer (METABRIC) and COVID-19 (GSE157103) datasets, respectively, outperforming Random Forest, Naïve Bayes models, and the existing research.\n",
      "Blood biomarkers can improve drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its treatment. Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) in plasma offer a minimally invasive platform for developing novel biomarkers that may be used to monitor the diverse pathogenic processes involved in AD. However, NDEVs comprise only a minor fraction of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs). Most published studies have leveraged the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) for NDEV immunocapture. We aimed to develop and optimize an alternative, highly specific immunoaffinity method to enrich blood NDEVs for biomarker development.\n",
      "After screening multiple neuronal antigens, we achieved NDEV capture with high affinity and specificity using antibodies against Growth-Associated Protein (GAP) 43 and Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3). The EV identity of the captured material was confirmed by electron microscopy, western blotting, and proteomics. The specificity for neuronal origin was demonstrated by showing enrichment for neuronal markers (proteins, mRNA) and recovery of spiked neuronal EVs. We performed NDEV isolation retrospectively from plasma samples from two cohorts of early AD patients (N = 19 and N = 40) and controls (N = 20 and N = 19) and measured p181-Tau, amyloid-beta (Aβ) 42, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), precursor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF), glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2), postsynaptic density protein (PSD) 95, GAP43, and syntaxin-1.\n",
      "p181-Tau, Aβ42, and NRGN were elevated in AD samples, whereas proBDNF, GluR2, PSD95, GAP43, and Syntaxin-1 were reduced. Differences for p181-Tau, proBDNF, and GluR2 survived multiple-comparison correction and were correlated with cognitive scores. A model incorporating biomarkers correctly classified 94.7% of AD participants and 61.5% of control participants. The observed differences in NDEVs-associated biomarkers are consistent with previous findings.\n",

      "Chronic pain (CP) is one of the most disabling conditions in the elderly and seems to be a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Only one study, using national administrative health databases, assessed and demonstrated that chronic pain (all types of pain) was a risk factor for dementia, but without assessing the impact of pain medications.\n",
      "To assess the impact of all types of chronic pain and the long-term use of pain medications on the person-years incidence of ADRD, a retrospective nationwide healthcare administrative data study was performed using the national inter-regime health insurance information system (SNIIRAM) to the French national health data system (SNDS). Incident people >50 years old with chronic pain, defined by at least 6-months duration analgesics treatment or by a diagnosis/long-term illness of chronic pain between 2006 and 2010, were included. Chronic pain individuals were matched with non-CP individuals by a propensity score. Individuals were followed up from 9 to 13 years to identify occurrences of ADRD from 2006.\n",

Yet, the lack of suitable experimental models to study receptor functions in the human brain has hampered elucidation of receptor actions in brain disease. Here, we have adapted protocols using human cerebral organoids to the detailed characterization of VPS10P domain receptor expression during neural development and differentiation, including single-cell RNA sequencing.

      "GABAergic inhibitory neurons are the principal source of inhibition in the brain. Traditionally, their role in maintaining the balance of excitation-inhibition has been emphasized. Beyond homeostatic functions, recent circuit mapping and functional manipulation studies have revealed a wide range of specific roles that GABAergic circuits play in dynamically tilting excitation-inhibition coupling across spatio-temporal scales. These span from gating of compartment- and input-specific signaling, gain modulation, shaping input-output functions and synaptic plasticity, to generating signal-to-noise contrast, defining temporal windows for integration and rate codes, as well as organizing neural assemblies, and coordinating inter-regional synchrony. GABAergic circuits are thus instrumental in controlling single-neuron computations and behaviorally-linked network activity. The activity dependent modulation of sensory and mnemonic information processing by GABAergic circuits is pivotal for the formation and maintenance of episodic memories in the hippocampus. Here, we present an overview of the local and long-range GABAergic circuits that modulate the dynamics of excitation-inhibition and disinhibition in the main output area of the hippocampus CA1, which is crucial for episodic memory. Specifically, we link recent findings pertaining to GABAergic neuron molecular markers, electrophysiological properties, and synaptic wiring with their function at the circuit level. Lastly, given that area CA1 is particularly impaired during early stages of Alzheimer's disease, we emphasize how these GABAergic circuits may contribute to and be involved in the pathophysiology.\n",
      "Irregular word reading has been used to estimate premorbid intelligence in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, reading models highlight the core influence of semantic abilities on irregular word reading, which shows early decline in AD. The general aim of this study is to determine whether irregular word reading is a valid estimate of premorbid intelligence, or a marker of cognitive and semantic decline in AD.\n",
      "681 healthy controls (HC), 104 subjective cognitive decline, 290 early and 589 late mild cognitive impairment (EMCI, LMCI) and 348 AD participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were included. Irregular word reading was assessed with the American National Adult Reading Test (AmNART). Multiple linear regressions were conducted predicting AmNART score using diagnostic category, general cognitive impairment and semantic tests. A generalized logistic mixed-effects model predicted correct reading using extracted psycholinguistic characteristics of each AmNART words. Deformation-based morphometry was used to assess the relationship between AmNART scores and voxel-wise brain volumes, as well as with the volume of a region of interest placed in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL).\n",
      "EMCI, LMCI and AD patients made significantly more errors in reading irregular words compared to HC, and AD patients made more errors than all other groups. Across the AD continuum, as well as within each diagnostic group, irregular word reading was significantly correlated to measures of general cognitive impairment / dementia severity. Neuropsychological tests of lexicosemantics were moderately correlated to irregular word reading whilst executive functioning and episodic memory were respectively weakly and not correlated. Age of acquisition, a primarily semantic variable, had a strong effect on irregular word reading accuracy whilst none of the phonological variables significantly contributed. Neuroimaging analyses pointed to bilateral hippocampal and left ATL volume loss as the main contributors to decreased irregular word reading performances.\n",
      "Irregular word reading performances decline throughout the AD continuum, and therefore, premorbid intelligence estimates based on the AmNART should not be considered accurate in MCI or AD. Results are consistent with the theory of irregular word reading impairments as an indicator of disease severity and semantic decline.\n",
      "Prior to a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, many individuals experience cognitive and behavioral fluctuations that are not detected during a single session of traditional neuropsychological assessment. Mobile applications now enable high-frequency cognitive data to be collected remotely, introducing new opportunities and challenges. Emerging evidence suggests cognitively impaired older adults are capable of completing mobile assessments frequently, but no study has observed whether completion rates vary by assessment frequency or adherence type.\n",
      "Thirty-three older adults were recruited from the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (mean age = 73.5 years; 27.3% cognitively impaired; 57.6% female; 81.8% White, 18.2% Black). Participants remotely downloaded and completed the DANA Brain Vital application on their own mobile devices throughout the study. The study schedule included seventeen assessments to be completed over the course of a year. Specific periods during which assessments were expected to be completed were defined as subsegments, while segments consisted of multiple subsegments. The first segment included three subsegments to be completed within one week, the second segment included weekly subsegments and spanned three weeks, and the third and fourth segments included monthly subsegments spanning five and six months, respectively.

      "Diabetes is associated with cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms are complex and their relationship with Alzheimer's Disease biomarkers is not fully understood. We assessed the association of small vessel disease (SVD) and amyloid burden with cognitive functioning in 47 non-demented older adults with type-2 diabetes from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study (mean age 78Y, 64% females). FLAIR-MRI, Vizamyl amyloid-PET, and T1W-MRI quantified white matter hyperintensities as a measure of SVD, amyloid burden, and gray matter (GM) volume, respectively. Mean hemoglobin A1c levels and duration of type-2 diabetes were used as measures of diabetic control. Cholesterol level and blood pressure were used as measures of cardiovascular risk. A broad neuropsychological battery assessed cognition. Linear regression models revealed that both higher SVD and amyloid burden were associated with lower cognitive functioning. Additional adjustments for type-2 diabetes-related characteristics, GM volume, and cardiovascular risk did not alter the results. The association of amyloid with cognition remained unchanged after further adjustment for SVD. Our findings suggest that SVD and amyloid pathology may independently contribute to lower cognitive functioning in non-demented older adults with type-2 diabetes, supporting a multimodal approach for diagnosing, preventing, and treating cognitive decline in this population.\n",
      "Auditory dysfunction, including central auditory hyperactivity, hearing loss and hearing in noise deficits, has been reported in 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, suggesting a causal relationship between amyloidosis and auditory dysfunction. Central auditory hyperactivity correlated in time with small amounts of plaque deposition in the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body, which are the auditory midbrain and thalamus, respectively. Neuroinflammation has been associated with excitation to inhibition imbalance in the central nervous system, and therefore has been proposed as a link between central auditory hyperactivity and AD in our previous report. However, neuroinflammation in the auditory pathway has not been investigated in mouse amyloidosis models.\n",
      "Machine learning was used to classify the previously obtained auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from 5xFAD mice and their wild type (WT) littermates. Neuroinflammation was assessed in six auditory-related regions of the cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. Cochlear pathology was assessed in cryosection and whole mount. Behavioral changes were assessed with fear conditioning, open field testing and novel objection recognition.\n",
      "Reliable machine learning classification of 5xFAD and WT littermate ABRs were achieved for 6M and 12M, but not 3M. The top features for accurate classification at 6 months of age were characteristics of Waves IV and V. Microglial and astrocytic activation were pronounced in 5xFAD inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body at 6 months, two neural centers that are thought to contribute to these waves. Lower regions of the brainstem were unaffected, and cortical auditory centers also displayed inflammation beginning at 6 months. No losses were seen in numbers of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), auditory synapses, or efferent synapses in the cochlea. 5xFAD mice had reduced responses to tones in fear conditioning compared to WT littermates beginning at 6 months.\n",
      "Serial use of ABR in early AD patients represents a promising approach for early and inexpensive detection of neuroinflammation in higher auditory brainstem processing centers. As changes in auditory processing are strongly linked to AD progression, central auditory hyperactivity may serve as a biomarker for AD progression and/or stratify AD patients into distinct populations.\n",

      "In the past two decades, network-based analysis has garnered considerable attention for analyzing time series data across various fields. Time series data can be transformed into graphs or networks using different methods, with the visibility graph (VG) being a widely utilized approach. The VG holds extensive applications in comprehending, identifying, and predicting specific characteristics of time series data. Its practicality extends to domains such as medicine, economics, meteorology, tourism, and others. This research presents a scoping review of scholarly articles published in reputable English-language journals and conferences, focusing on VG-based analysis methods related to brain disorders. The aim is to provide a foundation for further and future research endeavors, beginning with an introduction to the VG and its various types. To achieve this, a systematic search and refinement of relevant articles were conducted in two prominent scientific databases: Google Scholar and Scopus. A total of 51 eligible articles were selected for a comprehensive analysis of the topic. These articles categorized based on publication year, type of VG used, rationale for utilization, machine learning algorithms employed, frequently occurring keywords, top authors and universities, evaluation metrics, applied network properties, and brain disorders examined, such as Epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Autism, Alcoholism, Sleep disorders, Fatigue, Depression, and other related conditions. Moreover, there are recommendations for future advancements in research, which involve utilizing cutting-edge techniques like graph machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, the exploration of understudied medical conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Parkinson's disease is also suggested.\n",

      "Melanin, a ubiquitous dark pigment, plays important roles in the immune system, including scavenging reactive oxygen species formed in response to ultraviolet radiation absorption, absorbing metals, thermal regulation, drug uptake, innate immune system functions, redox, and energy transduction. Many tissue types, including brain, heart, arteries, ovaries, and others, contain melanin. Almost all cells contain precursors to melanin. A growing number of diseases in which there is a loss of melanin and/or neuromelanin are increasingly thought to have infectious etiologies, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and vitiligo. AD, PD, LBD, and vitiligo have been linked with herpesvirus, which enters melanosomes and causes apoptosis, and with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Herpesvirus is also linked with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. We theorize that under normal healthy states, melanin retains some of the energy it absorbs from electromagnetic radiation, which is then used to fuel cells, and energy from ATP is used to compliment that energy supply. We further theorize that loss of melanin reduces the energy supply of cells, which in the case of AD, PD, and LBD results in an inability to sustain immune system defenses and remove the plaques associated with the disease, which appear to be part of the immune system's attempt to eradicate the pathogens seen in these neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in an attempt to explain why removing these plaques does not result in improvements in cognition and mood and why cognitions and moods in these individuals have ebbs and flows, we postulate that it is not the plaques that cause the cognitive symptoms but, rather, inflammation in the brain resulting from the immune system's response to pathogens. Our theory that energy retained in melanin fuels cells in an inverse relationship with ATP is supported by studies showing alterations in ATP production in relationship to melanin levels in melanomas, vitiligo, and healthy cells. Therefore, alteration of melanin levels may be at the core of many diseases. We propose regulating melanin levels may offer new avenues for treatment development.\n",
      "High resolution and sensitivity brain SPECT is promising for the accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Multi-pinhole (MPH) collimators with a good performance in imaging small field-of-view (FOV) could be better used for brain SPECT. In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of varying the number of pinholes and the number of projections on the performance of MPH brain SPECT.\n",
      "The system design was based on a commercial clinical dual-head SPECT/CT scanner, with target spatial resolutions of 12 mm and 8 mm for AD and PD SPECT, respectively. In total, 1-25 pinholes were modeled for 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 projections. The 3D NURBS-based HUman Brain (NHUB) phantom was used in the analytical simulation to model \n",
      "Along with the decrease in the number of projections, more pinholes are required to achieve the optimum performance. For 32 projections, 9- and 7-pinhole collimators provide the best normalized mean square error (NMSE) to the coefficient of variation (COV) trade-off for \n",
      "The number of pinholes affects the performance of the MPH collimator, especially when the projection views become fewer. More pinholes are required for fewer projections to provide better angular sampling in MPH for complex activity distributions. Detector positions affect the image quality of MPH SPECT for 2 and 4 angular views, where L-mode acquisition is slightly superior to H-mode. MPH collimators exhibited improved spatial resolution and angular sampling compared with both LEHR and single pinhole collimators.\n",

      "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. TBI ranges from mild to severe and is a recognized risk factor for later neurodegenerative conditions including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The development of CTE is typically associated with repetitive exposure to mild TBI (mTBI), while a single moderate-to-severe TBI is considered a risk factor for AD and PD. Polypathology is common, and the lines between these conditions post TBI can be somewhat blurred. The mechanisms through which TBI leads to future neurodegeneration are not well understood. Heterogeneity and distance from the injury or injuries and individual genetic and environmental factors make clinical studies difficult. We present the case of an 82-year-old man who died 4 years after developing a phenotypically mixed dementia with neuropsychiatric features and parkinsonism. He had a remote history of a severe TBI 40 years prior, following a road traffic accident which caused a large right frontal injury, requiring neurosurgical intervention. Post-mortem neuropathological examination demonstrated abnormal phosphorylated-Tau (p-Tau), beta-amyloid plaques (Aβ) and α-synuclein deposition. Spatial immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased perivascular accumulation of p-Tau with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption at the site of injury, which decreased with distance from the injury site. The appearances are suggestive of initial vascular disruption with persisting BBB disruption as a driver of the pathology.\n",

Participants were examined for psychotic symptoms using two different instruments: the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) and a 10 question PD specific psychosis severity scale (10PDQ). In the PD group, medication use, motor and non-motor symptoms were documented.\n",
      "Based on CAARMS and 10PDQ scales, psychotic features were present in 39% (27/70) of patients and 4% (3/74) of controls. The prevalence of passage hallucinations and illusions was significantly higher in PD compared to the control group. The presence of PD-associated psychotic features was not significantly affected by medication, motor severity or global cognitive status. Higher prevalence of overall non-motor manifestations, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and depressive symptoms was significantly associated with the manifestation of psychotic features in PD [(adjusted OR:1.3; 95% CI:1.1-1.6; p = 0.003), (adjusted OR:1.3; 95% CI:1.0-1.6; p = 0.023), and (adjusted OR:1.2; 95% CI:1.0-1.4;p = 0.026)].\n",

These data suggest that this approach may serve an important role in clinical trials of disease-modifying agents for VCID that may preferentially affect WMH growth, stability, or regression.\n",
      "The role of metabolic syndrome (MetS) on dementia is disputed.\n",
      "We conducted a Mendelian randomization to clarify whether the genetically predicted MetS and its components are casually associated with the risk of different dementia types.\n",
      "The genetic predictors of MetS and its five components (waist circumference, hypertension, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) come from comprehensive public genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Different dementia types are collected from the GWAS in the European population. Inverse variance weighting is utilized as the main method, complemented by several sensitivity approaches to verify the robustness of the results.\n",
      "Genetically predicted MetS and its five components are not causally associated with the increasing risk of dementia (all p >  0.05). In addition, no significant association between MetS and its components and Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and dementia due to Parkinson's disease (all p >  0.05), except the association between HDL-C and dementia with Lewy bodies. HDL-C may play a protective role in dementia with Lewy bodies (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.92, p = 0.0010).\n",
      "From the perspective of genetic variants, our study provides novel evidence that MetS and its components are not associated with different dementia types.\n",
      "Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a pre-dementia syndrome characterized by subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait, is associated with disability in instrumental activities of daily living. It is unknown whether these functional limitations occur even before this pre-dementia syndrome is diagnosed.\n",
      "To assess profiles of complex and instrumental activities of daily living in the prodromal stages of MCR.\n",
      "We examined functional profiles in 46 older adults (mean age 79 years, 59% women) living in the community with normal cognition at baseline who developed MCR over follow-up ('pre-MCR') with 264 older adults (mean age 75 years, 57% women) who remained cognitively intact over the follow-up period.\n",
      "Pre-MCR individuals had more limitations on complex everyday function at baseline compared to normal controls in multivariable logistic regression models (odds ratio 1.21). Pre-MCR cases at baseline had limitations in handling finances (odds ratio 3.0) and performing hobbies (odds ratio 5.5) as compared to normal controls. Pre-MCR cases had a greater difference in the number of complex functional limitations from baseline to MCR compared to the difference from baseline to final visit for the controls (1.2±3.0 versus 0.5±2.2, p <  0.001).\n",

      "Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the most recognized risk gene for cognitive decline and clinical progression of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD); nonetheless, its association with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) remains inconclusive.\n",
      "To investigate the association of APOE ɛ4 with NPSs and explore nutritional status and cognition as joint mediators of this association.\n",
      "Between June 2021 and October 2022, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or AD were recruited from the Chinese Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Study. NPSs were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, while global cognition and nutritional status were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), respectively. Simple mediation and multiple chain mediation models were developed to examine the mediating effects of the MNA and MMSE scores on the relationship between APOE ɛ4 and specific neuropsychiatric symptom.\n",
      "Among 310 patients, 229 (73.87%) had NPSs, and 110 (35.48%) carried APOE ɛ4. Patients with APOE ɛ4 were more likely to have hallucinations (p = 0.014), apathy (p = 0.008), and aberrant motor activity (p = 0.018). MNA and MMSE scores mediated the association between APOE ɛ4 and hallucinations (17.97% and 37.13%, respectively), APOE ɛ4 and apathy (30.73% and 57.72%, respectively), and APOE ɛ4 and aberrant motor activity (17.82% and 34.24%), respectively. Chain-mediating effects of MNA and MMSE scores on the association of APOE ɛ4 with hallucinations, apathy, and aberrant motor activity after adjusting for confounding factors were 6.84%, 11.54%, and 6.19%, respectively.\n",

      "To investigate the associations of accelerometer-measured sedentary behavior patterns with brain structure and cognition, and further to explore the potential mechanisms.\n",
      "This community-based study included 2,019 older adults (age≥60 years, 59% women) without dementia derived from participants in the baseline examination of MIND-China (2018-2020). We assessed sedentary parameters using an accelerometer and cognitive function using a neuropsychological test battery. Structural brain markers were assessed on the structural brain MRI scans in a subsample (n = 1,009). Data were analyzed using the general linear, isotemporal substitution, and mediation models.\n",
      "In the total sample (n = 2,019), adjusting for multiple covariates and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity, longer mean sedentary bout duration was linearly related with lower z-scores of global cognition, verbal fluency, and memory (ptrend <  0.05), whereas greater total sedentary time was linearly associated with lower z-scores of global cognition, verbal fluency, and memory only among individuals with long sedentary time (>10 h/day) (ptrend <  0.05); Breaking up sedentary time with same amount of light-intensity physical activity was significantly associated with higher verbal fluency and memory z-scores (p <  0.05). In the MRI subsample (n = 1,009), separately entering structural brain MRI markers into the mediation models substantially attenuated the associations of mean sedentary bout duration with global cognition, verbal fluency, and memory z-scores.\n",
      "Prolonged uninterrupted sedentary time is associated with poor global cognition, memory, and verbal fluency among rural older adults, and structural brain markers could partially mediate the association.\n",
      "Digital voice recordings can offer affordable, accessible ways to evaluate behavior and function. We assessed how combining different low-level voice descriptors can evaluate cognitive status. Using voice recordings from neuropsychological exams at the Framingham Heart Study, we developed a machine learning framework fusing spectral, prosodic, and sound quality measures early in the training cycle. The model's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.832 (±0.034) in differentiating persons with dementia from those who had normal cognition. This offers a data-driven framework for analyzing minimally processed voice recordings for cognitive assessment, highlighting the value of digital technologies in disease detection and intervention.\n",

      "To understand the association between the pathogenesis of MI and AD and identify common biomarkers of both diseases.\n",
      "Using public databases, we identified common biomarkers of MI and AD. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed to further screen hub biomarkers. Functional enrichment analyses were performed on the hub biomarkers. Single-cell/nucleus analysis was utilized to further analyze the hub biomarkers at the cellular level in carotid atherosclerosis and AD datasets. Motif enrichment analysis was used to screen key transcription factors.\n",
      "26 common differentially expressed genes were screened between MI and AD. Function enrichment analyses showed that these differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with inflammatory pathways. A key gene, Regulator of G-protein Signaling 1 (RGS1), was obtained by LASSO regression and PPI network. RGS1 was confirmed to mainly express in macrophages and microglia according to single-cell/nucleus analysis. The difference in expression of RGS1 in macrophages and microglia between disease groups and controls was statistically significant (p <  0.0001). The expression of RGS1 in the disease groups was upregulated with the differentiation of macrophages and microglia. RelA was a key transcription factor regulating RGS1.\n",

When adjusted for factors including age at death, sex, race, tumor behavior, radiation therapy and tumor-directed surgery, glioblastoma was related to a significantly lower AD risk than other tumors (odds ratio: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05-0.77). Additionally, patients who were older, female, American Indian/Alaska Native, had a benign tumor, radiation therapy and tumor-directed surgery had a significantly higher risk of dying from AD.\n",

      "This study examines healthcare utilization associated with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias among older adults in the Caribbean as compared to the US.\n",
      "We conducted harmonized analyses of two population-based surveys, the 10/66 Dementia Group Research data collected in Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, and the US-based Health and Retirement Study. We examined changes in hospital nights and physician visits in response to incident and ongoing dementias.\n",
      "Incident dementia significantly increased the risk of hospitalization and number of hospital nights in both populations. Ongoing dementia increased the risk of hospitalization and hospital nights in the US, with imprecise estimates for the Caribbean. The number of physician visits was elevated in the US but not in the Caribbean.\n",

      "To explore the association of BMI changes with AD pathologies in APOE ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers.\n",
      "In 862 non-demented ADNI participants with≥2 BMI measurements, we investigated the relationships between BMI slopes and longitudinal changes in amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, neurodegeneration and cognition, and follow-up tau deposition in different Aβ and APOE ɛ4 statuses.\n",
      "In Aβ+ APOE ɛ4 non-carriers, faster BMI declines were associated with faster rates of Aβ accumulation (standardized β (βstd) = -0.29, p = 0.001), AD meta regions of interest (metaROI) hypometabolism (βstd = 0.23, p = 0.026), memory declines (βstd = 0.17, p = 0.029), executive function declines (βstd = 0.19, p = 0.011), and marginally faster Temporal-metaROI cortical thinning (βstd = 0.15, p = 0.067) and higher follow-up Temporal-metaROI tau deposition (βstd = -0.17, p = 0.059). Among Aβ- individuals, faster BMI decreases were related to faster Aβ accumulation (βstd = -0.25, p = 0.023) in APOE ɛ4 carriers, whereas predicted faster declines in memory and executive function in both APOE ɛ4 carriers (β std = 0.25, p = 0.008; β std = 0.32, p = 0.001) and APOE ɛ4 non-carriers (β std = 0.11, p = 0.030; β std = 0.12, p = 0.026).\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive dysfunction and memory loss that is accompanied by pathological changes to white matter. Some clinical and animal research revealed that AD combined with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) exacerbates AD progression by inducing blood-brain barrier dysfunction and fibrinogen deposition. Rivaroxaban, an anticoagulant, has been shown to reduce the rates of dementia in atrial fibrillation patients, but its effects on white matter and the underlying mechanisms are unclear.\n",
      "The main purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect of rivaroxaban on the white matter of AD+CCH mice.\n",
      "In this study, the therapeutic effects of rivaroxaban on white matter in a mouse AD+CCH model were investigated to explore the potential mechanisms involving fibrinogen deposition, inflammation, and oxidative stress on remyelination in white matter.\n",
      "The results indicate that rivaroxaban significantly attenuated fibrinogen deposition, fibrinogen-related microglia activation, oxidative stress, and enhanced demyelination in AD+CCH mice, leading to improved white matter integrity, reduced axonal damage, and restored myelin loss.\n",
      "These findings suggest that long-term administration of rivaroxaban might reduce the risk of dementia.\n",

      "Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses over a follow-up period of up to 13 years were conducted in a population sample of participants without dementia at baseline (n = 3,256, mean age = 79.62 years), using group comparisons and Cox proportional hazards models.\n",
      "Cross-sectionally, participants with subjective memory complaints were significantly more likely to report family history of dementia. Longitudinally, family history of dementia (FH) was significantly associated with subsequent dementia in the subjective memory complaints (SMC) group, but not in those without SMC. A relative excess risk due to interaction analysis confirmed a significant FHxSMC-interaction.\n",

      "Comprehensive treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) requires not only pharmacologic treatment but also management of existing medical conditions and lifestyle modifications including diet, cognitive training, and exercise. Personalized, multimodal therapies are needed to best prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n",
      "The Coaching for Cognition in Alzheimer's (COCOA) trial was a prospective randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a remotely coached multimodal lifestyle intervention would improve early-stage AD.\n",
      "Participants with early-stage AD were randomized into two arms. Arm 1 (N = 24) received standard of care. Arm 2 (N = 31) additionally received telephonic personalized coaching for multiple lifestyle interventions. The primary outcome was a test of the hypothesis that the Memory Performance Index (MPI) change over time would be better in the intervention arm than in the control arm. The Functional Assessment Staging Test was assessed for a secondary outcome. COCOA collected psychometric, clinical, lifestyle, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiome data at multiple timepoints (dynamic dense data) across two years for each participant.\n",
      "The intervention arm ameliorated 2.1 [1.0] MPI points (mean [SD], p = 0.016) compared to the control over the two-year intervention. No important adverse events or side effects were observed.\n",
      "Multimodal lifestyle interventions are effective for ameliorating cognitive decline and have a larger effect size than pharmacological interventions. Dietary changes and exercise are likely to be beneficial components of multimodal interventions in many individuals. Remote coaching is an effective intervention for early stage ADRD.

      "This registry-based study included 14,786 PWD, registered in the Swedish registry for cognitive and dementia disorders (2014-2016). Education and income, two traditional socioeconomic indicators, were the main exposure. Outcomes were any kind of long-term care, specific types of long-term care (home care, institutional care), and the monthly average hours of home care. The association between outcomes and socioeconomic status was examined with zero-inflated negative binomial regression and binary logistic regression.\n",
      "PWD with compulsory education had lower likelihood of receiving any kind of long-term care (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.93), or home care (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.97), compared to individuals with university degrees. Their monthly average hours of home care were 0.70 times (95% CI 0.59-0.82) lower than those of persons with university degrees. There was no significant association between education and the receipt of institutional care. Stratifying on persons with Alzheimer's disease showed significant association between lower education and any kind of long-term care, and between income and the hours of home care.\n",
      "Socioeconomic inequalities in long-term care existed in this study population. Lower-educated PWD were less likely to acquire general long-term care, home care and had lower hours of home care, compared to their higher-educated counterparts.

      "Autopsies were obtained in decedents with cognitive testing (n = 300). Aβ plaques and PHF tau-tangles were assessed in 24 sites: cerebrum (n = 14), brainstem (n = 5), olfactory bulb, and four spinal cord levels. Since spinal Aβ were absent in the first 165 cases, it was not assessed in the remaining cases.\n",
      "Age at death was 91 years old. About 90% had Aβ in cerebrum and of these, half had Aβ in the brainstem. Of the latter, 85% showed Aβ in the olfactory bulb. All but one participant had tau-tangles in the cerebrum and 86% had brainstem tau-tangles. Of the latter, 80% had tau-tangles in olfactory bulb and 36% tau-tangles in one or more spinal cord levels. About 90% of adults with tau-tangles also had Aβ in one or more regions. In a logistic model controlling for demographics, Aβ and tau-tangles within the cerebrum, the presence of Aβ in olfactory bulb [OR, 1.74(1.00, 3.05)]; tau-tangles in brainstem [OR, 4.00(1.1.57,10.21)]; and spinal cord [OR, 1.87 (1.21,3.11)] were independently associated with higher odds of dementia.\n",
      "Regional differences in Aβ and tau-tangle accumulation extend beyond cerebrum to spinal cord and their presence outside the cerebrum are associated with a higher odds of dementia.

      "To rank the effects of potentially dependent risk factors and identify an optimal parsimonious set of measures for predicting AD/ADRD risk from a larger pool of potentially correlated predictors.\n",
      "We used diagnosis record, survey, and genetic data from the Health and Retirement Study to assess the relative predictive strength of AD/ADRD risk factors spanning several domains: comorbidities, demographics/socioeconomics, health-related behavior, genetics, and environmental exposure. A modified stepwise-AIC-best-subset blanket algorithm was then used to select an optimal set of predictors.\n",
      "The final predictive model was reduced to 10 features for AD and 19 for ADRD; concordance statistics were about 0.85 for one-year and 0.70 for ten-year follow-up. Depression, arterial hypertension, traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular diseases, and the APOE4 proxy SNP rs769449 had the strongest individual associations with AD/ADRD risk. AD/ADRD risk-related co-morbidities provide predictive power on par with key genetic vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Results confirm the consensus that circulatory diseases are the main comorbidities associated with AD/ADRD risk and show that clinical diagnosis records outperform comparable self-reported measures in predicting AD/ADRD risk. Model construction algorithms combined with modern data allows researchers to conserve power (especially in the study of disparities where disadvantaged groups are often grossly underrepresented) while accounting for a high proportion of AD/ADRD-risk-related population heterogeneity stemming from multiple domains.\n",

      "Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by personality changes (such as irritability and restlessness) and psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations and delusions). When the personality changes become noticeable, involuntary movements (chorea) also develop. The disease is caused by the CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the HTT gene, and the diagnosis is based on the presence of this expansion. However, there is currently no effective treatment for the progression of Huntington's disease and its involuntary motor symptoms. Herein, we present a case in which memantine was effective in treating the chorea movements of Huntington's disease.\n",
      "A 75-year-old Japanese woman presented to the hospital with involuntary movements of Huntington's disease that began when she was 73 years old. In a cerebral blood flow test (N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single-photon emission computed tomography), decreased blood flow was observed in the precuneus (anterior wedge) and posterior cingulate gyrus. Usually, such areas of decreased blood flow are observed in patients with Alzheimer's-type dementia. So, we administered memantine for Alzheimer's-type dementia, and this treatment suppressed the involuntary movements of Huntington's disease, and the symptoms progressed slowly for 7 years after the onset of senility. In contrast, her brother died of complications of pneumonia during the course of Huntington's disease.\n",
      "We recorded changes in parameters such as the results of the N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single-photon emission computed tomography and gait videos over 7 years. Treatment with memantine prevented the chorea movement and the progression of Huntington's disease. We believe this record will provide clinicians with valuable information in diagnosing and treating Huntington's disease.\n",

      "To evaluate the effects of the implementation of the DSC in the ED.\n",
      "A pre-post comparison was conducted in the ED of a community hospital in Florence, Italy before and after the DSC was fully implemented. In the post-DSC phase, a clinical decision tree was applied: patients at low-mild risk (DSC class I and II) were assigned to Internal Medicine, those at moderate risk (class III) to Geriatrics, and those at high risk (class IV) required geriatric consultation before assignment. Outcome measures were ED length of stay (LOS) and, in patients admitted to Geriatrics, weight of the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG), hospital LOS, and mortality.\n",
      "7,270 patients were enrolled in the pre-DSC and 4,725 in the post-DSC phase. ED LOS decreased from a median of 380 [206, 958] in the pre-DSC to 318 [178, 655] min in the post-DSC period (p<0.001). Class III represented the largest share of admissions to Geriatrics in the post-DSC period (57.7 % vs. 38.3 %; p<0.001). In patients admitted to Geriatrics, hospital LOS decreased by one day (p = 0.006) between the two study periods, with greater DRG weight and comparable mortality.\n",

      "Estimating the risk of manic relapse could help the psychiatrist individually adjust the treatment to the risk. Some authors have attempted to estimate this risk from baseline clinical data. Still, no studies have assessed whether the estimation could improve by adding structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We aimed to evaluate it.\n",
      "We followed a cohort of 78 patients with a manic episode without mixed symptoms (bipolar type I or schizoaffective disorder) at 2-4-6-9-12-15-18 months and up to 10 years. Within a cross-validation scheme, we created and evaluated a Cox lasso model to estimate the risk of manic relapse using both clinical and MRI data.\n",

The most relevant variables included in the model were the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, poor impulse control, unusual thought content, and cerebellum volume decrease. The estimations were poorer when we used clinical or MRI data separately.\n",
      "Combining clinical and MRI data may improve the risk of manic relapse estimation after a manic episode. We provide a website that estimates the risk according to the model to facilitate replication by independent groups before translation to clinical settings.\n",
      "The perineuronal net (PNN) is a highly latticed extracellular matrix in the central nervous system, which is composed of hyaluronic acid, proteoglycan, hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein (Hapln), and tenascin. PNN is predominantly distributed in GABAergic interneurons expressing Parvalbumin (PV) and plays a critical role in synaptic function, learning and memory, oxidative stress, and inflammation. In addition, PNN's structure and function are also modulated by a variety of factors, including protein tyrosine phosphatase σ (PTPσ), orthodenticle homeo-box 2 (Otx2), and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4). Glycosaminoglycan (GAG), a component of proteoglycan, also influences PNN through its sulfate mode. PNN undergoes abnormal changes during aging and in various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and multiple sclerosis. Nevertheless, there is limited report on the relationship between PNN and aging or age-related neurological diseases. This review elaborates on the mechanisms governing PNN regulation and summarizes how PNN abnormalities contribute to aging and neurological diseases, offering insights for potential treatments.\n",

Twenty derivatives of diversely annelated eight-to-nine-membered azaheterocyclic ring, prepared through domino reaction of the respective tetrahydropyridine and azepine with activated alkynes, were assayed for the inhibitory activity against AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). As a major outcome, compound 7c, an alkylamino derivative of tetrahydropyrimido[4,5-d]azocine, was found to be a highly potent BChE-selective inhibitor, which showed a noncompetitive/mixed-type inhibition mechanism against human BChE with single digit nanomolar inhibition constant (K\n",
      "Abnormal post-translational modification of microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) is a prominent pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous research has focused on designing small molecules to target Tau modification, aiming to restore microtubule stability and regulate Tau levels in vivo. However, progress has been hindered, and no effective Tau-targeted drugs have been successfully marketed, which urgently requires more strategies. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), especially Hsp90 and Hsp70, have been found to play a crucial role in Tau maturation and degradation. This review explores innovative approaches using small molecules that interact with the chaperone system to regulate Tau levels. We provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms involving HSPs and their co-chaperones in the Tau regulation cycle. Additionally, we analyze small molecules targeting these chaperone systems to modulate Tau function. By understanding the characteristics of the molecular chaperone system and its specific impact on Tau, we aim to provide a perspective that seeks to regulate Tau levels through the manipulation of the molecular chaperone system and ultimately develop effective treatments for AD.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease is the most common age-associated neurodegenerative disorder and the most frequent form of dementia in our society. Aging is a complex biological process concurrently shaped by genetic, dietary and environmental factors and natural compounds are emerging for their beneficial effects against age-related disorders. Besides their antioxidant activity often described in simple model organisms, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of different dietary compounds remain however largely unknown. In the present study, we exploit the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a widely established model for aging studies, to test the effects of different natural compounds in vivo and focused on mechanistic aspects of one of them, quercetin, using complementary systems and assays. We show that quercetin has evolutionarily conserved beneficial effects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology: it prevents Amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced detrimental effects in different C. elegans AD models and it reduces Aβ-secretion in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, we found that the beneficial effects of quercetin are mediated by autophagy-dependent reduced expression of Abl tyrosine kinase. In turn, autophagy is required upon Abl suppression to mediate quercetin's protective effects against Aβ toxicity. Our data support the power of C. elegans as an in vivo model to investigate therapeutic options for AD.\n",
      "The pathological features of Alzheimer's disease are the formation of amyloid plaques and entanglement of nerve fibers. Studies have shown that Cu may be involved in the formation of amyloid plaques. However, their role has been controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the role of Cu in AD. We applied the \"R\" software for our differential analysis. Differentially expressed genes were screened using the limma package. Copper metabolism-related genes and the intersection set of differential genes with GSE5281 were searched; functional annotation was performed. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed using several modules to analyse the most significant hub genes. The hub genes were then qualified, and a database was used to screen for small-molecule AD drugs. We identified 87 DEGs. gene ontology analysis focused on homeostatic processes, response to toxic substances, positive regulation of transport, and secretion. The enriched molecular functions are mainly related to copper ion binding, molecular function regulators, protein-containing complex binding, identical protein binding and signalling receptor binding. The KEGG database is mainly involved in central carbon metabolism in various cancers, Parkinson's disease and melanoma. We identified five hub genes, FGF2, B2M, PTPRC, CD44 and SPP1, and identified the corresponding small molecule drugs. Our study identified key genes possibly related to energy metabolism in the pathological mechanism of AD and explored potential targets for AD treatment by establishing interaction networks.\n",
      "The effect of amyloid-β (Aβ) on cognitive impairment in patients with small subcortical infarction remains controversial, although a growing body of evidence shows a substantial overlap between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, another form of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). Therefore, we investigated the relationships between Aβ positivity and the development of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) in patients with small subcortical infarction.\n",
      "We prospectively recruited 37 patients aged ≥ 50 years, with first-ever small subcortical infarction, who underwent amyloid positron emission tomography, 3 months after stroke at Korea University Guro Hospital. We also enrolled CU participants matched for age and sex with stroke patients for comparison of Aβ positivity. Patients were followed up at 3 and 12 months after the stroke to assess cognitive decline. Logistic and linear mixed-effect regression analyses were performed to identify the effect of Aβ positivity on PSCI development and long-term cognitive trajectories.\n",
      "At 3 months after stroke, 12/37 (32.4%) patients developed PSCI, and 11/37 (29.7%) patients had Aβ deposition. Aβ positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 72.2, p = 0.024) was predictive of PSCI development regardless of cSVD burden. Aβ positivity (β = 0.846, p = 0.014) was also associated with poor cognitive trajectory, assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Box, for 1 year after stroke.\n",
      "Our findings highlight that Aβ positivity is an important predictor for PSCI development and cognitive decline over 1 year. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that anti-AD medications may be a strategy for preventing cognitive decline in patients with small subcortical infarctions.\n",
      "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered an early stage of dementia, with estimated rates of progression to dementia up to 80-90% after approximately 6 years from the initial diagnosis. Diagnosis of cognitive impairment in dementia is typically based on clinical evaluation, neuropsychological assessments, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The main goal of diagnosing MCI is to determine its cause, particularly whether it is due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, only a limited percentage of the population has access to etiological confirmation, which has led to the emergence of peripheral fluid biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for dementias, including MCI due to AD. Recent advances in biofluid assays have enabled the use of sophisticated statistical models and multimodal machine learning (ML) algorithms for the diagnosis of MCI based on fluid biomarkers from CSF, peripheral blood, and saliva, among others. This approach has shown promise for identifying specific causes of MCI, including AD. After a PRISMA analysis, 29 articles revealed a trend towards using multimodal algorithms that incorporate additional biomarkers such as neuroimaging, neuropsychological tests, and genetic information. Particularly, neuroimaging is commonly used in conjunction with fluid biomarkers for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our systematic review suggests that cost-effective longitudinal multimodal monitoring data, representative of diverse cultural populations and utilizing white-box ML algorithms, could be a valuable contribution to the development of diagnostic models for AD due to MCI. Clinical assessment and biomarkers, together with ML techniques, could prove pivotal in improving diagnostic tools for MCI due to AD.\n",
      "The prevalence of pain and dementia increases with age, affecting a significant percentage of the population due to aging. Both pathologies are connected through the inflammatory process, specifically through the tumor necrosis factor. The effect of this cytokine is mediated through the modulation of its TNFRI and TNFRII receptors, which are linked to the dementia process. In addition, immunoglobulins such as secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) have been recognized as one of the main biomarkers of pain in saliva. sTNFRII and sIgA levels were determined in saliva samples by ELISA from healthy people and patients with dementia in GDS stages 5-7. The concentrations of these markers were also correlated with the GDS stage and sex. We observed a significant decrease (*** p ≤ 0.001) in the levels of sTNFRII (pg/mL) and a significant increase (** p ≤ 0.01) in the levels of sIgA (ng/mL) in the saliva of patients with dementia compared to the healthy control group. We did not observe a correlation with the data of the biomarkers regarding the GDS stage and sex. The results obtained for sTNFRII are consistent with those obtained by other authors on brain tissue, who conclude that unopposed neuronal TNFRI signaling, when TNFRII is selectively downregulated, leads to a more severe course of AD pathogenesis. Regarding sIgA, the elevated values of sIgA may reflect the immune status of these patients. Therefore, these biomarkers can provide us with relevant information through a non-invasive method such as saliva analysis.\n",
      "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a neurological disorder that can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by three to five times more than those with normal cognition. To better understand the effects of daytime napping on MCI patients, a study was conducted to measure the effects of short naps on cognitive function, sleep quality, and quality of life. In total, 38 participants were asked to take 20-minute naps between 1:00p.m. and 3:00p.m. three times a week for eight weeks. The cognitive function of the participants was measured using the Thai version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Thai-MoCA), their sleep quality was measured using the Thai version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Thai-PSQI), and their quality of life was measured using the Thai version of the Quality of Life (Thai-QoL) questionnaire. After the 8-week period, the participants' scores for the Thai-MoCA and the Thai-QoL questionnaire showed a significant improvement (p < 0.001 for both), while the Thai-PSQI decreased significantly (p = 0.012). This suggests that taking short daytime naps can help to improve the cognitive function, sleep quality, and quality of life of MCI patients.\n",
      "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) causing cognitive impairment and dementia are difficult to treat due to the lack of understanding of primary initiating factors. Meanwhile, major sporadic NDDs share many risk factors and exhibit similar pathologies in their early stages, indicating the existence of common initiation pathways. Glucose hypometabolism associated with oxidative stress is one such primary, early and shared pathology, and a likely major cause of detrimental disease-associated cascades; targeting this common pathology may therefore be an effective preventative strategy for most sporadic NDDs. However, its exact cause and trigger remain unclear. Recent research suggests that early oxidative stress caused by NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation is a shared initiating mechanism among major sporadic NDDs and could prove to be the long-sought ubiquitous NDD trigger. We focus on two major NDDs - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as on acquired epilepsy which is an increasingly recognized comorbidity in NDDs. We also discuss available data suggesting the relevance of the proposed mechanisms to other NDDs. We delve into the commonalities among these NDDs in neuroinflammation and NOX involvement to identify potential therapeutic targets and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of NDDs.\n",
      "Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency can exacerbate AD progression and may cause changes in brain metabolite levels that can be detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The purpose of this study was to determine whether chronic VitD deficiency in an AD mouse model caused persistent metabolite levels changes in the hippocampus associated with memory performance. Six-month-old APPSwe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mice (N = 14 mice/group) were fed either a VitD deficient (VitD-) diet or a control diet. Metabolite level changes in the hippocampus were evaluated by \n",
      "Progranulin is a secreted pro-protein that has anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects and is necessary for maintaining lysosomal function. Mutations in progranulin (GRN) are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia. Most pathogenic GRN mutations cause progranulin haploinsufficiency, so boosting progranulin levels is a promising therapeutic strategy. Progranulin is constitutively secreted, then taken up and trafficked to lysosomes. Before being taken up from the extracellular space, progranulin interacts with receptors that may mediate anti-inflammatory and growth factor-like effects. Modifying progranulin trafficking is a viable approach to boosting progranulin, but progranulin secretion and uptake by cells in the brain is poorly understood and may involve distinct mechanisms from other parts of the body. Understanding the cell types and processes that regulate extracellular progranulin in the brain could provide insight into progranulin's mechanism of action and inform design of progranulin-boosting therapies. To address this question we used microdialysis to measure progranulin in interstitial fluid (ISF) of mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Grn\n",
      "Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are highly prevalent in long-term care settings. We sought to enhance the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of primary care clinicians caring for patients with BPSD through academic detailing, an evidence-based approach for persuading health care professionals to make changes in their practice. We implemented academic detailing among physicians and nurse practitioners in 2 primary care settings, one an urban center serving a largely Black community and another a rural center serving a largely white community, within primary care-integrated dementia diagnostic clinics. Each of the 11 academic detailing visits included didactic content, case discussion, and patient consultation. Outcome measures included assessments of clinicians' knowledge, confidence, and acceptability of the intervention. Of 15 providers who participated at baseline, 13 participated in 1 or more academic detailing visits in the next 18 months, 12 completed a 6-month assessment, and 7 completed an 18-month assessment. Knowledge and attitudes about BPSD increased during the program, and there was high satisfaction with the program. Academic detailing thus is a feasible way of improving self-reported knowledge, skills, and attitudes of primary care clinicians caring for patients with BPSD. We plan to scale up the intervention to assess the impact on patient and caregiver outcomes.\n",
      "The anti-inflammatory efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) with single fractions below 1.0 Gy has been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. As neuroinflammation is also a major pathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), RT may also be effective in PD treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of low-moderate dose RT (LMDRT, 0.6 Gy/single dose, for 5 days) exposure in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, for 5 consecutive days)-induced PD mouse model. Importantly, LMDRT reduced the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) in the striatum region, which increased following MPTP administration. LMDRT also modulated inflammatory gene expression patterns in the substantia nigra region of the MPTP-treated mice. However, LMDRT had no direct effects on the severe loss of dopaminergic neurons and impaired motor behavior in the rotarod test. These results indicate that LMDRT has anti-inflammatory effects by modulating neuroinflammatory factors, including glial fibrillary acidic protein and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, but showed no behavioral improvements or neuroprotection in the MPTP-induced mouse model of PD.\n",
      "Amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. In adult Drosophila brains, human Aβ overexpression harms climbing and lifespan. It's uncertain whether Aβ is intrinsically toxic or activates downstream neurodegeneration pathways. Our study uncovers a novel protective role against Aβ toxicity: intra-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein accumulation with a focus on laminin and collagen subunits. Despite high Aβ, laminin B1 (LanB1) overexpression robustly counters toxicity, suggesting a potential Aβ resistance mechanism. Other laminin subunits and collagen IV also alleviate Aβ toxicity; combining them with LanB1 augments the effect. Imaging reveals ER retention of LanB1 without altering Aβ secretion. LanB1's rescue function operates independently of the IRE1α/XBP1 ER stress response. ER-targeted GFP overexpression also mitigates Aβ toxicity, highlighting broader ER protein retention advantages. Proof-of-principle tests in murine hippocampal slices using mouse Lamb1 demonstrate ER retention in transduced cells, indicating a conserved mechanism. Though ER protein retention generally harms, it could paradoxically counter neuronal Aβ toxicity, offering a new therapeutic avenue for Alzheimer's disease.\n",

      "The ageing process is associated with reduced emotional recognition (ER) performance. The ER ability is an essential part of non-verbal communication, and its role is crucial for proper social functioning. Here, using the 'Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience cohort sample', we investigated when ER, measured using a facial emotion recognition test, begins to consistently decrease along the lifespan. Moreover, using structural and functional MRI data, we identified the neural correlates associated with ER maintenance in the age groups showing early signs of ER decline (N = 283; age range: 58-89 years). The ER performance was positively correlated with greater volume in the superior parietal lobule, higher white matter integrity in the corpus callosum and greater functional connectivity in the mid-cingulate area. Our results suggest that higher ER accuracy in older people is associated with preserved gray and white matter volumes in cognitive or interconnecting areas, subserving brain regions directly involved in emotional processing.\n",
      "This is a review of a recently published book entitled 'Alzheimer's Disease Research: What has guided research so far and why it is high time for a paradigm shift' by Christian Behl, a leading contributor to the field of Alzheimer disease over the last three decades. It presents a personal viewpoint on the historical developments in dementia research and therapeutics from its early beginnings through to the current day. The conflicting hypotheses, the therapeutic trials, the successes and the failures of the vast research infrastructure devoted to dissecting the aberrant pathways underlying the inexorable progression of this ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease are discussed. It is based, among others, on numerous personal discussions of the author with other leading researchers in the field, and thus gives this (hi)story of Alzheimer research a personal touch and spotlight on controversies that distinguishes it from other books in the field.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive illness with a slow start that lasts many years; the disease's consequences are devastating to the patient and the patient's family. If detected early, the disease's impact and prognosis can be altered significantly. Blood biosamples are often employed in simple medical testing since they are cost-effective and easy to collect and analyze. This research provides a diagnostic model for Alzheimer's disease based on federated learning (FL) and hardware acceleration using blood biosamples. We used blood biosample datasets provided by the ADNI website to compare and evaluate the performance of our models. FL has been used to train a shared model without sharing local devices' raw data with a central server to preserve privacy. We developed a hardware acceleration approach for building our FL model so that we could speed up the training and testing procedures. The VHDL hardware description language and an Altera 10 GX FPGA are utilized to construct the hardware-accelerator approach. The results of the simulations reveal that the proposed methods achieve accuracy and sensitivity for early detection of 89% and 87%, respectively, while simultaneously requiring less time to train than other algorithms considered to be state-of-the-art. The proposed algorithms have a power consumption ranging from 35 to 39 mW, which qualifies them for use in limited devices. Furthermore, the result shows that the proposed method has a lower inference latency (61 ms) than the existing methods with fewer resources.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that can cause dementia and result in a severe reduction in brain function, inhibiting simple tasks, especially if no preventative care is taken. Over 1 in 9 Americans suffer from AD-induced dementia, and unpaid care for people with AD-related dementia is valued at USD 271.6 billion. Hence, various approaches have been developed for early AD diagnosis to prevent its further progression. In this paper, we first review other approaches that could be used for the early detection of AD. We then give an overview of our dataset and propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture consisting of 7,866,819 parameters. This model comprises three different convolutional branches, each having a different length. Each branch is comprised of different kernel sizes. This model can predict whether a patient is non-demented, mild-demented, or moderately demented with a 99.05% three-class accuracy. In summary, the deep CNN model demonstrated exceptional accuracy in the early diagnosis of AD, offering a significant advancement in the field and the potential to improve patient care.\n",
      "Amyloid aggregates arise from either the partial or complete loss of the native protein structure or the inability of proteins to attain their native conformation. These aggregates have been linked to several diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and lysozyme amyloidosis. A comprehensive dataset was recently reported, demonstrating the critical role of the protein's surrounding environment in amyloid formation. In this study, we investigated the formation of lysozyme amyloid fibrils induced by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the effect of solvents in the medium. Experimental data obtained through fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a notable lag phase in amyloid formation when acetone solution was present. This finding suggested that the presence of acetone in the reaction medium created an unfavorable microenvironment for amyloid fibril formation and impeded the organization of the denatured protein into the fibril form. The in silico data provided insights into the molecular mechanism of the interaction between acetone molecules and the lysozyme protofibril, once acetone presented the best experimental results. It was observed that the lysozyme protofibril became highly unstable in the presence of acetone, leading to the complete loss of its β-sheet conformation and resulting in an open structure. Furthermore, the solvation layer of the protofibril in acetone solution was significantly reduced compared to that in other solvents, resulting in fewer hydrogen bonds. Consequently, the presence of acetone facilitated the exposure of the hydrophobic portion of the protofibril, precluding the amyloid fibril formation. In summary, our study underscores the pivotal role the surrounding environment plays in influencing amyloid formation.\n",
      "The deterioration of brain glucose metabolism predates the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) positively improve brain glucose metabolism and decrease the expression of AD-related proteins. However, the effects of the combined intervention are unclear. The present study explored the effects of the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA in improving brain glucose metabolism and decreasing AD-related protein expression levels in APP/PS1 mice. The mice were assigned into four dietary treatment groups: the control group, MCTs group, DHA group, and MCTs + DHA group. The corresponding diet of the respective groups was fed to mice from the age of 3 to 11 months. The results showed that the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could increase serum octanoic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), DHA, and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) levels; improve glucose metabolism; and reduce nerve cell apoptosis in the brain. Moreover, it also aided with decreasing the expression levels of amyloid beta protein (Aβ), amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1) in the brain. Furthermore, the supplementation of MCTs + DHA was significantly more beneficial than that of MCTs or DHA alone. In conclusion, the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could improve energy metabolism in the brain of APP/PS1 mice, thus decreasing nerve cell apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of Aβ.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a combination of several neuropathological hallmarks, such as extracellular aggregates of beta amyloid (Aβ). Numerous alternatives have been studied for inhibiting Aβ aggregation but, at this time, there are no effective treatments available. Here, we developed the tri-component nanohybrid system AuNPs@POM@PEG based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) covered with polyoxometalates (POMs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). In this work, AuNPs@POM@PEG demonstrated the inhibition of the formation of amyloid fibrils, showing a 75% decrease in Aβ aggregation in vitro. As it is a potential candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of AuNPs@POM@PEG and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We achieved a stable nanosystem that is non-cytotoxic below 2.5 nM to human neurovascular cells. The brain permeability of AuNPs@POM@PEG was analyzed in an in vitro microphysiological model of the BBB (BBB-on-a-chip), containing 3D human neurovascular cell co-cultures and microfluidics. The results show that AuNPs@POM@PEG was able to cross the brain endothelial barrier in the chip and demonstrated that POM does not affect the barrier integrity, giving the green light to further studies into this system as a nanotherapeutic.\n",

      "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), commonly driven by KRAS mutations, is responsible for 7% of all cancer mortality. The first allele-specific KRAS inhibitors were recently approved in LUAD, but clinical benefit is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. LUAD predominantly arises from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which function as facultative alveolar stem cells by self-renewing and replacing alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. Using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples we found inhibition of KRAS promotes transition to a quiescent AT1-like cancer cell state in LUAD tumors. Similarly, suppressing Kras induced AT1 differentiation of wild-type AT2 cells upon lung injury. The AT1-like LUAD cells exhibited high growth and differentiation potential upon treatment cessation, whereas ablation of the AT1-like cells robustly improved treatment response to KRAS inhibitors. Our results uncover an unexpected role for KRAS in promoting intra-tumoral heterogeneity and suggest targeting alveolar differentiation may augment KRAS-targeted therapies in LUAD.\n",
      "Nutritional factors play crucial roles in immune responses. The tumor-caused nutritional deficiencies are known to affect anti-tumor immunity. Here, we demonstrate that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells can suppress NK cell cytotoxicity by restricting the accessibility of vitamin B6 (VB6). PDAC cells actively consume VB6 to support one-carbon metabolism, and thus tumor cell growth, causing VB6 deprivation in the tumor microenvironment. In comparison, NK cells require VB6 for intracellular glycogen breakdown, which serves as a critical energy source for NK cell activation. VB6 supplementation in combination with one-carbon metabolism blockage effectively diminishes tumor burden in vivo. Our results expand the understanding of the critical role of micronutrients in regulating cancer progression and anti-tumor immunity, and open new avenues for developing novel therapeutic strategies against PDAC.\n",
      "Robotic surgery is used in the treatment of kidney tumors. We aimed to determine if robotic access was associated with initial choice of management for patients with a clinical stage I kidney mass.\n",
      "Patients with a clinical stage I kidney mass were identified from the Canadian Kidney Cancer information system (CKCis) cohort. Sites were classified by year and access to robotic surgery. Associations between robotic access and initial management were determined using logistic regression. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed, adjusting for tumor size and stage, and presented as relative risks (RR) or adjusted RR (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n",
      "Overall, 4160 patients were included. Among patients treated with surgery, the proportion of partial nephrectomy, compared to radical nephrectomy, was significantly higher in robotic sites (77.3% for robotic sites vs. 65.9% for non-robotic sites; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.12-1.23, p<0.0001; aRR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08-1.17, p<0.0001). Patients receiving partial nephrectomy at sites with robotic access were more likely to receive a minimally invasive approach compared to patients at non-robotic sites (61.4% vs. 50.9%, RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.12- 1.30; aRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08-1.25, p<0.0001). The proportion of patients managed by active surveillance was not significantly different between robotic 405 (16.9%) and non-robotic 258 (14.7%) sites (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.99-1.32; aRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.12).\n",
      "Access to robotic kidney surgery was associated with increased use of partial nephrectomy and minimally invasive partial nephrectomy. Use of active surveillance was similar at robotic and non-robotic institutions. Limitations of this study include lack of data on perioperative complications and cancer recurrence.\n",
      "Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) failure occurs in approximately 40% of patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) within two years. We describe our institutional experience with sequential intravesical gemcitabine and docetaxel (gem/doce) as salvage therapy post- BCG failure in patients who were not candidates for or declined radical cystectomy (RC).\n",
      "We retrospectively reviewed BCG-failure patients with NMIBC who received gem/doce from April 2019 through October 2022 at the CHU de Québec-Université Laval. Patients received at least five weekly intravesical instillations according to published protocols. Patients who responded to gem/doce had maintenance instillations monthly for up to two years. Primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included recurrence-free survival (RFS), cystectomy-free survival (CFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), and treatment adverse events. Survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method from the first gem/doce instillation.\n",
      "Thirty-five patients with a median age of 78 years old were included in the study. The median followup time was 21 months (interquartile range 10-29). More than 25% of patients received two or more prior BCG induction treatments. Overall/MIBC PFS estimates at one year were 85%/88% and 60%/70% at two years. Adverse events occurred in 37% of the patients, but only two patients didn't complete the treatment due to intolerance. Three patients underwent radical cystectomy due to cancer progression. OS was 94% at two years.\n",
      "With 60% of PFS at two years, gem/doce appears to be a safe and well-tolerated option for BCG failure patients. Further studies are needed to justify widespread use.\n",
      "Radiation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with a 15-20% five-year recurrence rate. Patients with recurrence in the prostate only are candidates for salvage local therapies, however, there is no consensus on modality. This study uses registries at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and University of Western Ontario (UWO) to compare the oncologic outcomes of salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP) and salvage ablation (SA).\n",
      "A total of 444 patients were available for analysis. Due to intergroup differences, propensity score methodology was used and identified 378 patients with more comparable presalvage PSA, Gleason score, and primary radiation treatment. Patients underwent SRP at MSKCC and SA at UWO.\n",
      "Of the 378 patients, 48 died of disease, with a 6.0-year median (interquartile range [IQR] 3.0, 9.7) followup among survivors; 88 developed metastases, with a median 4.6-year (IQR 2.3, 7.9) followup among metastasis-free survivors. There was a non-significantly higher rate of cancer-specific (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51, 2.06, p=0.9) and improved metastasis-free survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.44, 1.13, p=0.15) among patients undergoing SA compared to patients undergoing SRP. There were 143 patients who received hormonal therapy, with higher rates of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in SA (HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.97, 2.08, p=0.068), although this did not meet conventional levels of significance.\n",
      "This propensity score analysis of salvage therapy for radio-recurrent prostate cancer identified no statistically significant differences in oncologic outcome between SRP and SA; however, there was evidence of a lower risk of ADT in the cohort undergoing SRP. Given they are both potentially curative therapies, these treatments are viable options for men with clinically localized, radio-recurrent prostate cancer rather than ADT alone. Future research may further elucidate subpopulations that may be more amenable to either SRP or SA.\n",
      "Approximately 20-40% of kidney cancer patients treated for localized disease experience post-surgical recurrence. Several prognostic models exist to help clinicians determine the risk of distant recurrence, but these models vary in criteria and endpoints. We aimed to examine the recurrence rate and clinicopathologic factors as predictors of recurrence in high-risk renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients.\n",
      "We conducted a single-center, retrospective chart review of T3 RCC patients who underwent a nephrectomy between January 2000 and December 2015. Patients registered in clinical trials for adjuvant therapy and those with fewer than three years of followup were excluded. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox regression were performed to identify the rate and predictors of disease recurrence.\n",
      "Eighty-eight pT3 RCC patients were included, and 39 patients had recurrence with a median of 23.5 months (range 1.6-127.5). Nine patients had disease recurrence beyond 58 months. Kaplan-Meier log-rank tests identified patients with negative surgical margins and low Fuhrman nuclear grades had greater recurrence-free survival. Univariate Cox regression revealed positive surgical margins, high Fuhrman nuclear grade, and large tumor sizes were significant predictors. In the multivariate Cox regression model, high Fuhrman nuclear grade and positive surgical margins were significant predictors of recurrence.\n",
      "Disease recurrence occurred in 44% of T3-staged patients. High Fuhrman nuclear grade and positive surgical margins were associated with time to recurrence. Physicians should use prognostic models to facilitate conversations about disease recurrence and continue to monitor high-risk patients beyond the recommended five-year followup period. We recommend monitoring pT3 resected patients for up to 10 years post-surgery.\n",
      "Elective pelvic nodal irradiation for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) undergoing trimodal therapy (TMT) is controversial. In patients with node-negative (N0) MIBC, the benefit of elective whole-pelvis concurrent chemoradiation (WP-CCR) compared to bladder-only (BO)-CCR has not been demonstrated. Using real-world data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB), we sought to compare the overall survival (OS) between BO-CCR and WP-CCR for MIBC.\n",
      "Using the 2020 NCDB Participant User File, we identified cases of MIBC diagnosed between 2017 and 2019. We selected patients with clinical T2-T4aN0M0 disease receiving CCR as first-line treatment. CCR was defined as transurethral resection of bladder tumor followed by ≥40 Gy radiation to the bladder with concurrent single- or multiple-agent chemotherapy. Based on elective nodal irradiation status, patients were stratified as having received BO-CCR vs. WPCCR. OS analysis was performed using summary three-month conditional landmark, inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression.\n",
      "A total of 604 patients receiving CCR for MIBC were identified: 367 (60.8%) BO-CCR and 237 (39.2%) WP-CCR. Before IPTW, the groups were imbalanced in terms of baseline characteristics. The median followup of the weighted population was 42.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 18.1-49.1 months). In IPTW-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, WP-CCR was associated with a significant OS benefit compared to BO-CCR (adjusted hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.96, p=0.026).\n",

Results showed physician presenters had a Video Power Index (video popularity) of 23.45, while patient presenters had an average of 61.36 (almost three times as popular as physician-led videos). The overall accuracy of videos showed that 82% demonstrated completely accurate and detailed information, 18% showed partially complete information, and 76% showed no biased information. No false information was found in any videos.\n",
      "This study showed that while the YouTube informational videos included good coverage of treatment side effects, there were gaps in information regarding quality of life after treatment or management of side effects.

      "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) continues to have a dismal prognosis. The poor survival of patients with PDA has been attributed to a high rate of early metastasis and low efficacy of current therapies, which partly result from its complex immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Previous studies from our group and others have shown that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are instrumental in maintaining immunosuppression in PDA. Here, we explored the role of Notch signaling, a key regulator of immune response, within the PDA microenvironment. We identified Notch pathway components in multiple immune cell types within human and mouse pancreatic cancer. TAMs, the most abundant immune cell population in the tumor microenvironment, expressed high levels of Notch receptors, with cognate ligands such as JAG1 expressed on tumor epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. TAMs with activated Notch signaling expressed higher levels of immunosuppressive mediators, suggesting that Notch signaling plays a role in macrophage polarization within the PDA microenvironment. Genetic inhibition of Notch in myeloid cells led to reduced tumor size and decreased macrophage infiltration in an orthotopic PDA model. Combination of pharmacological Notch inhibition with PD-1 blockade resulted in increased cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, tumor cell apoptosis, and smaller tumor size. Our work implicates macrophage Notch signaling in the establishment of immunosuppression and indicates that targeting the Notch pathway may improve the efficacy of immune-based therapies in PDA patients.\n",
      "Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) presents a distinct biological context from other thyroid cancers due to its specific cellular origin. This heterogeneous and rare tumor has a high prevalence of advanced diseases, making it crucial to address the limited therapeutic options and enhance complex clinical management. Given the high clinical accessibility of methylation information, we construct the largest MTC methylation cohort to date.\n",
      "78 fresh-frozen MTC samples constituted our methylation cohort. The comprehensive study process incorporated machine learning, statistical analysis, and in vitro experiments.\n",
      "Our study pioneered the identification of a 3-class clustering system for risk stratification, exhibiting pronounced epigenomic heterogeneity. The elevated overall methylation status in MTC-B, combined with the \"mutual exclusivity\" of hypomethylated sites displayed by MTC-A and MTC-C, distinctively characterized the MTC-specific methylation pattern. Integrating with the transcriptome, we further depicted the features of these three clusters to scrutinize biological properties. Several MTC-specific aberrant DNA methylation events were emphasized in our study. NNAT expression was found to be notably reduced in poor-prognostic MTC-C, with its promoter region overlapping with an upregulated differentially methylated region. In vitro experiments further affirmed NNAT's therapeutic potential. Moreover, we built an elastic-net logistic regression model with a relatively high AUC encompassing 68 probes, intended for future validation and systematic clinical application.\n",

      "Radical surgery is the standard treatment for rectal cancer, but can impact quality of life. Recently, the concept of total neoadjuvant therapy with a watch-and-wait strategy has been proposed in which patients with a cCR after total neoadjuvant therapy do not proceed to surgery. However, most investigations of a watch-and-wait strategy have reported cases where cCR was achieved coincidentally via total neoadjuvant therapy. The aim is to assess whether total neoadjuvant therapy is effective in early-stage rectal cancer in patients that achieve cCR and are offered a watch-and-wait strategy.\n",
      "JCOG2010 (TOWARd) is a multi-institutional, single-arm phase II/III confirmatory investigation of the safety and efficacy of total neoadjuvant therapy followed by a watch-and-wait strategy for rectal cancer. Key eligibility criteria include cT2-3 N0 M0 rectal adenocarcinoma, tumour diameter less than or equal to 5 cm, age 18-75 years, performance status 0-1, and no history of pelvic irradiation or rectal surgery. Total neoadjuvant therapy involves neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (capecitabine and radiotherapy: 45 Gy/25 fractions to the whole pelvis plus boost of 5.4 Gy/3 fractions to the primary tumour) followed by consolidation chemotherapy (four cycles of capecitabine/oxaliplatin). Patients will be re-staged every 8 weeks after total neoadjuvant therapy, and those who achieve cCR will undergo a watch-and-wait strategy, those with near complete response will undergo a watch-and-wait strategy or local resection, and those with an incomplete response will undergo radical surgery. The primary endpoint is the cCR rate in phase II and 5-year overall survival in phase III. Secondary endpoints include postoperative anal, urinary, and sexual function. A total of 105 patients (phase II, 40 patients; phase III, 65 patients) will be enrolled over 3.5 years.\n",

Accordingly, 4 deep learning-based models for different analytic stages of karyotyping, including denoising, segmentation, classification, and polarity recognition, were developed and integrated as an R-banded bone marrow karyotype analysis system. Five-fold cross validation was performed on each model. The whole system was implemented by 2 strategies of automatic and semiautomatic workflows. A test set of 885 metaphases was used to assess the entire system.\n",
      "The denoising model achieved an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 99.20% and a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 99.58% for metaphase acquisition. The segmentation model achieved an IoU of 91.95% and a DSC of 95.79% for chromosome segmentation. The accuracies of the segmentation, classification, and polarity recognition models were 96.77%, 98.77%, and 99.93%, respectively.

      "Of 21,015 patients identified, 5708 (27.2%) underwent MIG (LG = 21.9%, RG = 5.3%). Patients who underwent RG were more likely to have met all TOO criteria, and consequently TOO. Logistic regression models revealed that patients undergoing MIG were significantly more likely to attain TOO. MIG was associated with a higher likelihood of adequate LAD, no prolonged LOS, and concordant chemotherapy. Patients who underwent LG and achieved TOO had the highest median OS (86.7 months), while the OG non-TOO cohort experienced the lowest (34.6 months). The median OS for the RG TOO group was not estimable; however, the mortality rate (.7%) was the lowest of the six cohorts.\n",

      "C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a fluid-phase complement inhibitor that prevents uncontrolled activation of the classical and lectin complement pathways. As a complement inhibitor, C4BP also promotes apoptotic cell death and is hijacked by microbes and tumors for complement evasion. Although initially characterized for its role in complement inhibition, there is an emerging recognition that C4BP functions in a complement-independent manner to promote cell survival, protect against autoimmune damage, and modulate the virulence of microbial pathogens. In this Brief Review, we summarize the structure and functions of human C4BP, with a special focus on activities that extend beyond the canonical role of C4BP in complement inhibition.\n",
      "Mature T cell lymphomas are heterogeneous neoplasms that are aggressive and resistant to treatment. Many of these cancers retain immunological properties of their cell of origin. They express cytokines, cytotoxic enzymes, and cell surface ligands normally induced by TCR signaling in untransformed T cells. Until recently, their molecular mechanisms were unclear. Recently, high-dimensional studies have transformed our understanding of their cellular and genetic characteristics. Somatic mutations in the TCR signaling pathway drive lymphomagenesis by disrupting autoinhibitory domains, increasing affinity to ligands, and/or inducing TCR-independent signaling. Collectively, most of these mutations augment signaling pathways downstream of the TCR. Emerging data suggest that these mutations not only drive proliferation but also determine lymphoma immunophenotypes. For example, RHOA mutations are sufficient to induce disease-relevant CD4+ T follicular helper cell phenotypes. In this review, we describe how mutations in the TCR signaling pathway elucidate lymphoma pathophysiology but also provide insights into broader T cell biology.\n",
      "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) describes the outsized contribution of expanded clones of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to blood cell production. The prevalence of CH increases dramatically with age. CH can be caused by somatic mutations in individual genes or by gains and or losses of larger chromosomal segments. CH is a premalignant state; the somatic mutations detected in CH are the initiating mutations for hematologic malignancies, and CH is a strong predictor for the development of blood cancers. Moreover, CH is associated with non-malignant disorders and increased overall mortality. The somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion of HSPCs can alter the function of terminally differentiated blood cells, including release of elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines may then contribute to a broad range of inflammatory disorders that increase in prevalence with age. Detection of specific somatic mutations in the peripheral blood, in coordination with blood count parameters, can powerfully predict the development of hematologic malignancies and overall mortality. In this review we summarize the current understanding of CH nosology and origins. We provide an overview of available tools for risk stratification and discuss management strategies for patients presenting to hematology clinics with CH.\n",

      "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)-representative immune-suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME)-are known to promote tumor progression and metastasis, and thus have been considered an attractive target for cancer therapy. However, current TAM-targeting strategies are insufficient to result in robust antitumor efficacy. Here, we report a small lipid nanoparticle encapsulating immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (SLNP@CpG) as a new immunotherapeutic modality that can reprogram TAMs and further bridge innate-to-adaptive immunity. We found that SLNP@CpG treatment enhanced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of cancer cells and tumor antigen cross-presentation and skewed the polarization state of macrophages in vitro. Intratumoral injection of SLNP@CpG into an established murine E.G7-OVA tumor model significantly suppressed tumor growth and considerably prolonged survival, completely eradicating tumors in 83.3% of mice. Furthermore, tumor-free mice resisted rechallenge with E.G7-OVA cancer cells through induction of immunological memory and long-term antitumor immunity. SLNP@CpG even exerted antitumor efficacy in an aggressive B16-F10 melanoma model by remodeling TME towards immune stimulation and tumor elimination. These findings suggest that, by modulating the function of TAMs and reshaping an immunosuppressive TME, the SLNP@CpG nanomedicine developed here may become a promising immunotherapeutic option applicable to a variety of tumors.

      "Nanofibrous scaffolds have attracted much attention in bladder reconstruction approaches due to their excellent mechanical properties. In addition, their biological properties can be improved by combination with biological materials. Taking into account the advantages of nanofibrous scaffolds and decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) in tissue engineering, scaffolds of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) coated with decellularized human amnion membrane (hAM) or sheep bladder (SB)-derived ECM proteins are developed (amECM-coated PLLA and sbECM-coated PLLA, respectively). The bladder regenerative potential of modified electrospun PLLA scaffolds is investigated in rabbits. The presence of ECM proteins is confirmed on the nanofibers' surface. Coating the surface of the PLLA nanofibers improves cell adhesion and proliferation. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluations show that rabbits subjected to cystoplasty with a multilayered PLLA scaffold show de novo formation and maturation of the multilayered urothelial layer. However, smooth muscle bundles (myosin heavy chain [MHC] and α-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA] positive) are detected only in ECM-coated PLLA groups. All groups show no evidence of a diverticulumor fistula in the urinary bladder. These results suggest that the biofunctionalization of electrospun PLLA nanofibers with ECM proteins could be a promising option for bladder tissue engineering. Furthermore, hAM can also replace animal-sourced ECM proteins in bladder tissue regeneration approaches. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most pervasive lung cancer subtype. Recent studies have shown that immune checkpoint inhibitors achieved favorable clinical benefits in resectable NSCLC; however, the associated mechanism remains unclear. The role of T cells in antitumor immunity has received considerable attention, while the antitumor effects of tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIBs) in NSCLC remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a single-cell RNA-seq analysis of immune cells isolated from 12 patients with IIIA NSCLC to investigate B cell subtypes and their functions following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. We confirmed the simultaneous existence of the four B cell subtypes. Among them, memory B cells were found to be associated with a positive therapeutic effect to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Furthermore, we found that G Protein-Coupled Receptor 183 (GPR183) was most prevalent in memory B cells and associated with a positive therapeutic response. Multiplex immunofluorescence and flow cytometry experiments in an additional cohort of 22 treatment-naïve and 30 IIIA/IIIB NSCLC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy verified these findings. Overall, our analysis revealed the functions of TIBs and their potential effect on clinical treatment in NSCLC.\n",
      "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in therapy, but the differences between MSCs of various origins and their ability to undergo osteogenic differentiation and produce extracellular matrix are not fully understood. To address this, we conducted a comparative analysis of mesenchymal cell primary cultures from six human sources, including osteoblast-like cells from the adult femur, adipose-derived stem cells, Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal cells, gingival fibroblasts, dental pulp stem cells, and periodontal ligament stem cells. We analyzed these cells' secretome, proteome, and transcriptome under standard and osteogenic cultivation conditions. Despite the overall similarity in osteogenic differentiation, the cells maintain their embryonic specificity after isolation and differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, we propose classifying mesenchymal cells into three groups: dental stem cells of neural crest origin, mesenchymal stem cells, and fetal stem cells. Specifically, fetal stem cells have the most promising secretome for various applications, while mesenchymal stem cells have a specialized secretome optimal for extracellular matrix production. Nevertheless, mesenchymal cells from all sources secreted core bone extracellular matrix-associated proteins. In conclusion, our study illuminates the distinctive characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells from various sources, providing insights into their potential applications in regenerative medicine and enhancing our understanding of the inherent diversity of mesenchymal cells in vivo.\n",

      "Ephrin-B2 (EFNB2) is a ligand for six Eph receptors in humans and functions as a cell entry receptor for several henipaviruses including the Nipah virus (NiV), a pathogenic zoonotic virus with pandemic potential. To understand the sequence basis of promiscuity for EFNB2 binding to the attachment glycoprotein of NiV (NiV-G) and Eph receptors, we performed deep mutagenesis on EFNB2 to identify mutations that enhance binding to NiV-G over EphB2, one of the highest affinity Eph receptors. The mutations highlight how different EFNB2 conformations are selected by NiV-G versus EphB2. Specificity mutations are enriched at the base of the G-H binding loop of EFNB2, especially surrounding a phenylalanine hinge upon which the G-H loop pivots, and at a phenylalanine hook that rotates away from the EFNB2 core to engage Eph receptors. One EFNB2 mutant, D62Q, possesses pan-specificity to the attachment glycoproteins of closely related henipaviruses and has markedly diminished binding to the six Eph receptors. However, EFNB2-D62Q has high residual binding to EphB3 and EphB4. A second deep mutational scan of EFNB2 identified combinatorial mutations to further enhance specificity to NiV-G. A triple mutant of soluble EFNB2, D62Q-Q130L-V167L, has minimal binding to Eph receptors but maintains binding, albeit reduced, to NiV-G. Soluble EFNB2 decoy receptors carrying the specificity mutations were potent neutralizers of chimeric henipaviruses. These findings demonstrate how specific residue changes at the shared binding interface of a promiscuous ligand (EFNB2) can influence selectivity for multiple receptors, and may also offer insight toward the development of henipavirus therapeutics and diagnostics. IMPORTANCE Ephrin-B2 (EFNB2) is a ligand for six Eph receptors in humans and regulates multiple cell developmental and signaling processes. It also functions as the cell entry receptor for Nipah virus and Hendra virus, zoonotic viruses that can cause respiratory and/or neurological symptoms in humans with high mortality. Here, we investigate the sequence basis of EFNB2 specificity for binding the Nipah virus attachment G glycoprotein over Eph receptors. We then use this information to engineer EFNB2 as a soluble decoy receptor that specifically binds the attachment glycoproteins of the Nipah virus and other related henipaviruses to neutralize infection. These findings further mechanistic understanding of protein selectivity and may facilitate the development of diagnostics or therapeutics against henipavirus infection.\n",
      "Human genetic variants that introduce an AG into the intronic region between the branchpoint (BP) and the canonical splice acceptor site (ACC) of protein-coding genes can disrupt pre-mRNA splicing. Using our genome-wide BP database, we delineated the BP-ACC segments of all human introns and found extreme depletion of AG/YAG in the [BP+8, ACC-4] high-risk region. We developed AGAIN as a genome-wide computational approach to systematically and precisely pinpoint intronic AG-gain variants within the BP-ACC regions. AGAIN identified 350 AG-gain variants from the Human Gene Mutation Database, all of which alter splicing and cause disease. Among them, 74% created new acceptor sites, whereas 31% resulted in complete exon skipping. AGAIN also predicts the protein-level products resulting from these two consequences. We performed AGAIN on our exome/genomes database of patients with severe infectious diseases but without known genetic etiology and identified a private homozygous intronic AG-gain variant in the antimycobacterial gene \n",

      "For cancer therapy, paclitaxel (PX) possesses several limitations, including limited solubility and untargeted effects. Loading PX into nanoliposomes to enhance PX solubility and target their delivery as a drug delivery system has the potential to overcome these limitations. Over the other conventional method to prepare liposomes, a microfluidic system is used to formulate PX-loaded PEGylated liposomes. The impact of changing the flow rate ratio (FRR) between the aqueous and lipid phases on the particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) is investigated. Moreover, the effect of changing the polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid ratio on the particle size, PDI, stability, encapsulation efficiency % (EE %), and release profile is studied. The physicochemical characteristics of the obtained formulation were analyzed by dynamic light scattering, FTIR spectroscopy, and AFM. This work aims to use microfluidic technology to produce PEGylated PX-loaded liposomes with a diameter of <200 nm, low PDI < 0.25 high homogeneity, and viable 28 day stability. The results show a significant impact of FRR and PEG lipid ratio on the empty liposomes' physicochemical characteristics. Among the prepared formulations, two formulations produce size-controlled, low PDI, and stable liposomes, which make them preferable for PX encapsulation. The average EE % was >90% for both formulations, and the variation in the PEG lipid ratio affected the EE % slightly; a high packing for PX was reported at different drug concentrations. A variation in the release profiles was notified for the different PEG lipid ratios.\n",
      "Serving as the basis of cell life, interactions between nucleic acids and proteins play essential roles in fundamental cellular processes. Aptamers are unique single-stranded oligonucleotides generated by in vitro evolution methods, possessing the ability to interact with proteins specifically. Altering the structure of aptamers will largely modulate their interactions with proteins and further affect related cellular behaviors. Recently, with the in-depth research of aptamer-protein interactions, the analytical assays based on their interactions have been widely developed and become a powerful tool for biomolecular detection. There are some insightful reviews on aptamers applied in protein detection, while few systematic discussions are from the perspective of regulating aptamer-protein interactions. Herein, we comprehensively introduce the methods for regulating aptamer-protein interactions and elaborate on the detection techniques for analyzing aptamer-protein interactions. Additionally, this review provides a broad summary of analytical assays based on the regulation of aptamer-protein interactions for detecting biomolecules. Finally, we present our perspectives regarding the opportunities and challenges of analytical assays for biological analysis, aiming to provide guidance for disease mechanism research and drug discovery.\n",
      "Nanotheranostics is a rapidly developing field that integrates nanotechnology, diagnostics, and therapy to provide novel methods for imaging and treating wide categories of diseases. Targeted nanotheranostics offers a platform for the precise delivery of theranostic agents, and their therapeutic outcomes are monitored in real-time. Presently, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence imaging, ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic imaging (PAI), etc. are noninvasive imaging techniques that are preclinically available for the imaging and tracking of therapeutic outcomes in small animals. Additionally, preclinical imaging is essential for drug development, phenotyping, and understanding disease stage progression and its associated mechanisms. Small animal ultrasound imaging is a rapidly developing imaging technique for theranostics applications due to its merits of being nonionizing, real-time, portable, and able to penetrate deep tissues. Recently, different types of ultrasound contrast agents have been explored, such as microbubbles, echogenic exosomes, gas-vesicles, and nanoparticles-based contrast agents. Moreover, an optical image obtained through photoacoustic imaging is a noninvasive imaging technique that creates ultrasonic waves when pulsed laser light is used to expose an object and creates a picture of the tissue's distribution of light energy absorption on the object. Contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging may be endogenous (hemoglobin, melanin, and DNA/RNA) or exogenous (dyes and nanomaterials-based contrast agents). The integration of nanotheranostics with photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging allows simultaneous imaging and treatment of diseases in small animals, which provides essential information about the drug response and the disease progression. In this review, we have covered various endogenous and exogenous contrast agents for ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. Additionally, we have discussed various drug delivery systems integrated with contrast agents for theranostic application. Further, we have briefly discussed the current challenges associated with ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging.\n",
      "Aberrant activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway is common in many cancers including melanoma, and AKT1, 2 and 3 (AKT1-3) are bona fide oncoprotein kinases with well-validated downstream effectors. However, efforts to pharmacologically inhibit AKT have proven to be largely ineffective. In this study, we observed paradoxical effects following either pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of AKT1-3 in melanoma cells. Although pharmacological inhibition was without effect, genetic silencing of all three AKT paralogs significantly induced melanoma cell death through effects on mTOR. This phenotype was rescued by exogenous AKT1 expression in a kinase dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K and mTOR with a novel dual inhibitor effectively suppressed melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, this single agent targeted therapy was well tolerated in vivo and was effective against MAPK inhibitor resistant patient-derived melanoma xenografts. These results suggest that inhibition of PI3K and mTOR with this novel dual inhibitor may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in this disease in both the first line and MAPK inhibitor resistant setting.\n",

      "The mutational processes dictating the accumulation of mutations in genomes are shaped by genetic background, environment and their interactions. Accurate quantification of mutation rates and spectra under drugs has important implications in disease treatment. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing and time-resolved growth phenotyping of yeast mutation accumulation lines to give a detailed view of the mutagenic effects of rapamycin and hydroxyurea on the genome and cell growth. Mutation rates depended on the genetic backgrounds but were only marginally affected by rapamycin. As a remarkable exception, rapamycin treatment was associated with frequent chromosome XII amplifications, which compensated for rapamycin induced rDNA repeat contraction on this chromosome and served to maintain rDNA content homeostasis and fitness. In hydroxyurea, a wide range of mutation rates were elevated regardless of the genetic backgrounds, with a particularly high occurrence of aneuploidy that associated with dramatic fitness loss. Hydroxyurea also induced a high T-to-G and low C-to-A transversion rate that reversed the common G/C-to-A/T bias in yeast and gave rise to a broad range of structural variants, including mtDNA deletions. The hydroxyurea mutation footprint was consistent with the activation of error-prone DNA polymerase activities and non-homologues end joining repair pathways. Taken together, our study provides an in-depth view of mutation rates and signatures in rapamycin and hydroxyurea and their impact on cell fitness, which brings insights for assessing their chronic effects on genome integrity.\n",
      "Damage to light-sensing photoreceptors (PRs) occurs in highly prevalent retinal diseases. As humans cannot regenerate new PRs, these diseases often lead to irreversible blindness. Intriguingly, animals, such as the zebrafish, can regenerate PRs efficiently and restore functional vision. Upon injury, mature Müller glia (MG) undergo reprogramming to adopt a stem cell-like state. This process is similar to cellular dedifferentiation, and results in the generation of progenitor cells, which, in turn, proliferate and differentiate to replace lost retinal neurons. In this study, we tested whether factors involved in dedifferentiation of Drosophila CNS are implicated in the regenerative response in the zebrafish retina. We found that hairy-related 6 (her6) negatively regulates of PR production by regulating the rate of cell divisions in the MG-derived progenitors. prospero homeobox 1a (prox1a) is expressed in differentiated PRs and may promote PR differentiation through phase separation. Interestingly, upon Her6 downregulation, Prox1a is precociously upregulated in the PRs, to promote PR differentiation; conversely, loss of Prox1a also induces a downregulation of Her6. Together, we identified two novel candidates of PR regeneration that cross regulate each other; these may be exploited to promote human retinal regeneration and vision recovery.\n",

      "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a very lethal disease with a low survival rate, making timely and accurate diagnoses critical for successful treatment. PC classification in computed tomography (CT) scans is a vital task that aims to accurately discriminate between tumorous and non-tumorous pancreatic tissues. CT images provide detailed cross-sectional images of the pancreas, which allows oncologists and radiologists to analyse the characteristics and morphology of the tissue. Machine learning (ML) approaches, together with deep learning (DL) algorithms, are commonly explored to improve and automate the performance of PC classification in CT scans. DL algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are broadly utilized for medical image analysis tasks, involving segmentation and classification. This study explores the design of a tunicate swarm algorithm with deep learning-based pancreatic cancer segmentation and classification (TSADL-PCSC) technique on CT scans. The purpose of the TSADL-PCSC technique is to design an effectual and accurate model to improve the diagnostic performance of PC. To accomplish this, the TSADL-PCSC technique employs a W-Net segmentation approach to define the affected region on the CT scans. In addition, the TSADL-PCSC technique utilizes the GhostNet feature extractor to create a group of feature vectors. For PC classification, the deep echo state network (DESN) model is applied in this study. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning of the DESN approach occurs utilizing the TSA which assists in attaining improved classification performance. The experimental outcome of the TSADL-PCSC method was tested on a benchmark CT scan database. The obtained outcomes highlighted the significance of the TSADL-PCSC technique over other approaches to PC classification.\n",
      "Many viruses have evolved ways to restructure their host cell's nucleus profoundly and unexpectedly upon infection. In particular, DNA viruses that need to commandeer their host's cellular synthetic functions to produce their progeny can induce the condensation and margination of host chromatin during productive infection, a phenomenon known as virus-induced reorganization of cellular chromatin (ROCC). These ROCC-inducing DNA viruses belong to 5 families (herpesviruses, baculoviruses, adenoviruses, parvoviruses, and geminiviruses) that infect a wide range of hosts and are important for human and ecosystem health, as well as for biotechnology. Although the study of virus-induced ROCC is in its infancy, investigations are already raising important questions, such as why only some DNA viruses that replicate their genomes in the nucleus elicit ROCC. Studying the shared and distinct properties of ROCC-inducing viruses will provide valuable insights into viral reorganization of host chromatin that could have implications for future therapies that target the viral life cycle.\n",
      "Although immunotherapy can prolong survival in some patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the response rate remains low. Clarification of the critical mechanisms regulating CD8+ T-cell infiltration and dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment could help maximize the benefit of immunotherapy for treating HNSCC. Here, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis of HNSCC specimens with differing immune infiltration and single-cell RNA sequencing of five pairs of tumor and adjacent tissues, revealing specific CAF subsets related to CD8+ T-cell infiltration restriction and dysfunction. These CAFs exhibited high expression of CXCLs (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12) and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and enrichment of galectin-9 (Gal-9). The proportion of MHC-IhiGal-9+ CAFs was inversely correlated with abundance of a TCF1+GZMK+ subset of CD8+ T cells. Gal-9 on CAFs induced CD8+ T cell dysfunction and decreased the proportion of tumor-infiltrating TCF1+CD8+ T cells. Collectively, the identification of MHC-IhiGal-9+ CAFs advances the understanding of the precise role of CAFs in cancer immune evasion and paves the way for more effective immunotherapy for HNSCC.\n",

Simulated subjects could: 1) present to an emergency department (ED), with or without readmission, 2) present for direct readmission, 3) require additional office visits, or 4) no additional care. We informed our model using the most current available published data and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate thresholds under which dedicated perioperative APP Navigators are beneficial.\n",
      "Subjects within the APP Navigators cohort accumulated $1,270 and a readmission rate of 6.9%, compared with $2,170 and 13.5% with No APP Navigators, yielding a cost-savings of $905 and 48% relative reduction in readmission. Based on these estimated cost-savings and national salary ranges, a perioperative APPs become financially self-sustaining with 113 to 139 annual HPB cases, equating to 2 to 3 HPB cases weekly.

      "Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a persistent anti-proliferative response that acts as a barrier against malignant transformation. During OIS, cells undergo dynamic remodeling, which involves alterations in protein and organelle homeostasis through autophagy. Here, we show that ribosomes are selectively targeted for degradation by autophagy during OIS. By characterizing senescence-dependent alterations in the ribosomal interactome, we find that the deubiquitinase USP10 dissociates from the ribosome during the transition to OIS. This release of USP10 leads to an enhanced ribosome ubiquitination, particularly of small subunit proteins, including lysine 275 on RPS2. Both reinforcement of the USP10-ribosome interaction and mutation of RPS2 K275 abrogate ribosomal delivery to lysosomes without affecting bulk autophagy. We show that the selective recruitment of ubiquitinated ribosomes to autophagosomes is mediated by the p62 receptor. While ribophagy is not required for the establishment of senescence per se, it contributes to senescence-related metabolome alterations and facilitates the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.\n",

      "T cell engaging bispecifics have great clinical potential for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. The binding affinity and kinetics of a bispecific molecule for both target and T cell CD3 have substantial effects on potency and specificity, but the rules governing these relationships are not fully understood. Using ImmTAC (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer) molecules as a model, we explored the impact of altering affinity for target and CD3 on the potency and specificity of the re-directed T cell response. This class of bispecifics, exemplified by tebentafusp which has recently shown survival benefit in a randomized phase 3 clinical trial1, bind specific target peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on the cell surface via an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor and can redirect T cell activation with an anti-CD3 effector moiety. The data reveal that combining a strong affinity TCR with an intermediate affinity anti-CD3 results in optimal T cell activation, while strong affinity of both targeting and effector domains significantly reduces maximum cytokine release. Moreover, by optimising the affinity of both parts of the molecule, it is possible to improve the selectivity. These results could be effectively modelled based on kinetic proof-reading with limited signalling. This model explained the experimental observation that strong binding at both ends of the molecules leads to reduced activity, through very stable target-bispecific-effector complexes leading to CD3 entering a non-signalling dark-state. These findings have important implications for the design of anti-CD3 based bispecifics with optimal biophysical parameters for both activity and specificity.\n",

      "This study evaluated the chemical content of capsule cigarettes from two Latin American countries that have two of the highest market shares for capsule cigarettes worldwide. Compared to other studies, our assessment included brand varieties from two countries to compare the differences in chemical content by country. Our results yield that menthol is found in all capsules, and that other chemicals found may prolong nicotine exposure and therefore reinforce the addictive properties of cigarettes.\n",
      "The nervous system is one of the most complicated and enigmatic systems within the animal kingdom. Recently, the emergence and development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have provided an unprecedented ability to systematically decipher the cellular heterogeneity and spatial locations of the nervous system from multiple unbiased aspects. However, efficiently integrating, presenting and analyzing massive multiomic data remains a huge challenge. Here, we manually collected and comprehensively analyzed high-quality scRNA-seq and ST data from the nervous system, covering 10 679 684 cells. In addition, multi-omic datasets from more than 900 species were included for extensive data mining from an evolutionary perspective. Furthermore, over 100 neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome) were systematically analyzed for high-throughput screening of putative biomarkers. Differential expression patterns across developmental time points, cell types and ST spots were discerned and subsequently subjected to extensive interpretation. To provide researchers with efficient data exploration, we created a new database with interactive interfaces and integrated functions called the Spatiotemporal Cloud Atlas for Neural cells (SCAN), freely accessible at http://47.98.139.124:8799 or http://scanatlas.net. SCAN will benefit the neuroscience research community to better exploit the spatiotemporal atlas of the neural system and promote the development of diagnostic strategies for various neurological disorders.\n",
      "Pioneer transcription factors (TFs) like SOX2 are vital for stemness and cancer through enhancing gene expression within transcriptional condensates formed with coactivators, RNAs and mediators on super-enhancers (SEs). Despite their importance, how these factors work together for transcriptional condensation and activation remains unclear. SOX2, a pioneer TF found in SEs of pluripotent and cancer stem cells, initiates SE-mediated transcription by binding to nucleosomes, though the mechanism isn't fully understood. To address SOX2's role in SEs, we identified mSE078 as a model SOX2-enriched SE and p300 as a coactivator through bioinformatic analysis. In vitro and cell assays showed SOX2 forms condensates with p300 and SOX2-binding motifs in mSE078. We further proved that SOX2 condensation is highly correlated with mSE078's enhancer activity in cells. Moreover, we successfully demonstrated that p300 not only elevated transcriptional activity but also triggered chromatin acetylation via its direct interaction with SOX2 within these transcriptional condensates. Finally, our validation of SOX2-enriched SEs showcased their contribution to target gene expression in both stem cells and cancer cells. In its entirety, this study imparts valuable mechanistic insights into the collaborative interplay of SOX2 and its coactivator p300, shedding light on the regulation of transcriptional condensation and activation within SOX2-enriched SEs.\n",
      "Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) and its formation of RNA:DNA hybrids (or TERRA R-loops), influence telomere maintenance, particularly in human cancer cells that use homologous recombination-mediated alternative lengthening of telomeres. Here, we report that the RNA-binding motif protein 14 (RBM14) is associated with telomeres in human cancer cells. RBM14 negatively regulates TERRA expression. It also binds to TERRA and inhibits it from forming TERRA R-loops at telomeres. RBM14 depletion has several effects, including elevated TERRA levels, telomeric R-loops, telomere dysfunction-induced DNA damage foci formation, particularly in the presence of DNA replication stress, pRPA32 accumulation at telomeres and telomere signal-free ends. Thus, RBM14 protects telomere integrity via modulating TERRA levels and its R-loop formation at telomeres.\n",
      "The spatiotemporal control over the drug's action offered by ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes by the selective activation of the prodrug inside the tumor has beaconed toward much-desired selectivity issues in cancer chemotherapy. The photocaging of anticancer bioactive ligands attached synergistically with cytotoxic Ru(II) polypyridyl cores and selective release thereof in cancer cells are a promising modality for more effective drug action. Diallyl sulfide (DAS) naturally found in garlic has anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Herein, we designed two Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes to cage DAS having a thioether-based donor site. For in-depth photocaging studies, we compared the reactivity of the DAS-caged compounds with the uncaged Ru(II)-complexes with the general formula [Ru(ttp)(NN)(L)]\n",
      "The fourth-generation (4th-gen) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1/2 antibody/antigen (Ab/Ag) combination immunoassay currently used for HIV screening offers greater sensitivity than previous assays, but false-reactive results occur in up to 20% of patients. Large-scale observations in cancer patients are lacking.\n",
      "We conducted a retrospective study of cancer patients seen at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (March 2016-January 2023) who had reactive 4th-gen ARCHITECT HIV-1/2 Ab/Ag combination immunoassay results. We analyzed characteristics of patients with true-reactive and false-reactive results, defined based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.\n",
      "A total of 43 637 patients underwent 4th-gen HIV screening, and 293 had reactive 4th-gen HIV test results. Twenty-one patients were excluded because they did not have cancer. Among the remaining 272 patients, 78 (29%) had false-reactive results. None of these patients experienced delays in their cancer treatment, but 26% experienced mental distress. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified 5 predictors of having false-reactive results: age >60 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.983; P < .0001), female sex (aOR, 6.060; P < .0001), race/ethnicity (Black: aOR, 0.274; Hispanic: aOR, 0.236; P = .002), syphilis coinfection (aOR, 0.046; P = .038), and plant alkaloids therapy (aOR, 2.870; P = .013).\n",
      "False-reactive 4th-gen HIV test results occur in almost one-third of cancer patients. Physicians should be aware of the high rates of false-reactive HIV screening results in this patient population. These findings may have implications for counseling regarding testing, especially among those at low risk for HIV infection.\n",
      "Chronic fatigue is a common symptom among patients who have been treated for cancer. Current psychosocial interventions typically target the patient alone, despite growing evidence suggesting that a couples' approach can increase and broaden the efficacy of an intervention. Therefore, based on an existing web-based mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients, the couple intervention COMPANION was developed.\n",
      "The primary objectives of this study are to determine the acceptability of COMPANION and its potential efficacy in reducing fatigue in patients with cancer. Our secondary objectives are to examine the feasibility of the trial procedures and the potential working mechanisms of the couple intervention.\n",
      "We will conduct a single-arm pilot trial for couples (ie, patients with cancer with chronic fatigue and their partners). All couples are allocated to the web-based couple intervention that consists of psychoeducation, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral exercises. The 9 sessions of the intervention are supervised remotely by a trained therapist. Patients and partners will complete questionnaires before starting the intervention (T0), 2 weeks after completing the intervention (T1), and 1 month after T1 (T2). They will also fill out weekly diaries during the intervention period. A subsample of patients (n≈5) and partners (n≈5) as well as all the therapists providing COMPANION will participate in the final focus groups. Benchmark values have been defined to determine the acceptability (ie, ≥60% of couples complete the intervention and/or ≥70% of the participants are satisfied with the intervention) and potential efficacy (ie, a significant improvement in fatigue and/or a clinically relevant improvement in fatigue in 45% of the patients between T0 and T1) of the intervention. The trial procedures are deemed feasible if an average of at least three couples are included per recruiting month and/or adherence to the assessments is at least 65% for T1 and the diaries and 60% for T2. To establish potential working mechanisms, changes in affect, sleep, catastrophizing, partner communication and interactions, self-efficacy, mindfulness, and closeness will be examined. Quantitative outcomes will be interpreted along with the results from the focus groups.\n",

Quitting smoking can improve treatment effects and reduce side effects. This study reports on the potential impact of a smoking cessation program on smoking cessation rates among patients in cancer treatment.\n",
      "Cancer patients 18 years and older who smoked, with survival prognosis ≥12 months, not suffering dementia or other mental illness, and who were referred to cancer treatment at six Norwegian hospitals were invited to participate. The study took place from 2017 to 2020 and used a pre-test-posttest non-equivalent control group design. The intervention group received structured smoking cessation guidance based on Motivational Interviewing combined with cost-free nicotine replacement products, while the control group received standard smoking cessation treatment. Self-reported smoking status were registered at baseline and at 6 months' follow up.\n",
      "76% of patients smoked at baseline and 44% at follow-up in the intervention group, correspondingly 72% and 49% in the control group. In an analysis of differences in within-person change, the reduction in the intervention group was 13 percentage points larger (95% CI = (0.25, -0.005), \n",

      "5-Hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) is an oxidation derivative of thymine in the genomes of various organisms and may serve as both an epigenetic mark and a cancer biomarker. However, the current 5hmU assays usually have drawbacks of laborious procedures, low specificity, and unsatisfactory sensitivity. Herein, we demonstrate the click chemistry-mediated hyperbranched amplification-driven dendritic nanoassembly for genome-wide analysis of 5hmU in breast cell lines and human breast tissues. The proposed strategy possesses good selectivity, ultralow background, and high sensitivity with a detection limit of 83.28 aM. This method can accurately detect even a 0.001% 5hmU level in the mixture. Moreover, it can determine 5hmU at single-cell level and distinguish the expressions of 5hmU in tissues of normal persons and breast cancer patients, holding great promise in 5hmU-related biological research and clinical diagnosis.\n",
      "Prostate cancer is the second-most prevalent cancer diagnosis worldwide among males. Although prostate cancer affects the physical, sexual, and mental health of patients, the impact of prostate cancer on partners has also been increasingly recognized. Hence, taking a dyadic approach is of relevance. Moreover, there is evidence of the utility of dyadic approaches to the study of relational stress that chronic diseases such as prostate cancer can bring to couples, even though knowledge is sparse about prostate cancer.\n",
      "This scoping review aimed to map existing dyadic studies on the psychosocial adaptation of couples to prostate cancer.\n",
      "A systematic search of studies published from 2005 to November 2022 was conducted on electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCOHost, Scopus, and Web of Science) following PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses-Extension for Scoping Reviews).\n",
      "The review included 25 eligible studies from the initial 2514 articles retrieved. Overall, the results emphasized the interdependency between couple members and suggested how partners' adaptation influences patients' adaptation to prostate cancer and vice versa, regarding several psychosocial dimensions (eg, intimacy, quality of life).\n",
      "This work can bring awareness to health care professionals to adopt a couples approach when managing prostate cancer whenever there is a partner, due to these interdependent influences. For researchers and future studies, this work can strengthen the relevance of dyadic approaches on how couples adapt to prostate cancer and explore which other dimensions influence these complex dynamics.\n",

      "A total of 29 community-dwelling older adults (≥70-years); recruited from organisation newsletters, mailing lists and Facebook advertisements.\n",
      "Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically using Framework Analysis.\n",
      "Firstly, older adults were on a spectrum between trusting recommendations and actively deciding about cancer screening, with some who were uncertain. Secondly, participants reported limited in-depth discussions with health professionals about cancer screening. In primary care, discussions were focused on checking they were up to date with screening or going over results. Discussions mostly only occurred if older adults initiated themselves. Finally, participants had a socially- and self-constructed understanding of screening recommendations and potential outcomes. Perceived reasons for upper age limits were cost, reduced cancer risk or ageism. Risks of screening were understood in relation to their own social experiences (e.g. shared stories about friends with adverse outcomes of cancer treatment or conversations with friends/family about controversy around prostate screening).\n",
      "Direct-to-patient information and clinician support may help improve communication about the changing benefit to harm ratio of cancer screening with increasing age and increase understanding about the rationale for an upper age limit for cancer screening programmes.\n",
      "Developing a reproducible and secure supply of customizable control tissues that standardizes for the cell type, tissue architecture, and preanalytics of interest for usage in applications including diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive assays, is critical for improving our patient care and welfare. The conventionally adopted control tissues directly obtained from patients are not ideal because they oftentimes have different amounts of normal and neoplastic elements, differing cellularity, differing architecture, and unknown preanalytics, in addition to the limited supply availability and thus associated high costs. In this study, we demonstrated a strategy to stably produce tissue-mimics for diagnostics purposes by taking advantage of the three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology. Specifically, we take anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (Alk+) lung cancer as an example, where a micropore-forming bioink laden with tumor cells was combined with digital light processing-based bioprinting for developing native-like Alk+ lung cancer tissue-mimics with both structural and functional relevancy. It is anticipated that our proposed methodology will pave new avenues for both fields of tissue diagnostics and 3D bioprinting significantly expanding their capacities, scope, and sustainability.\n",
      "Although hospice care has been covered by health insurance for the purpose of improving the quality of life of patients with terminal cancer as well as their caregivers, few studies have evaluated the outcomes of the policy to cover home-based hospice care services.\n",
      "To investigate the changes in the place of death of patients with cancer after the introduction of insurance-covered, home-based hospice care services in Korea.\n",
      "This cohort study used data from February 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021, from the Causes of Death Statistics database, released annually by Statistics Korea, which contains information on all deaths in the country. Individuals who died of cancer, a representative hospice-eligible disease, were assigned to the case group, and those who died of dementia, a non-hospice-eligible disease, were assigned to the control group. A total of 218 522 individuals constituted the study population.\n",
      "Because the Korean Health Insurance Service had begun covering home-based hospice care services on September 1, 2020, and the last follow-up date was December 31, 2021, the follow-up periods for before and after intervention were 31 months and 16 months, respectively (preintervention period: February 1, 2018, to August 31, 2020; postintervention period: September 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021).\n",
      "The place of death was categorized as a binary variable according to whether it was the person's own home or not. Comparative interrupted time-series models with segmented regression were applied to analyze the time trend and its change in outcomes.\n",
      "Of the 218 522 deaths eligible for the analysis (mean [SD] age at death, 78.6 [8.8] years; 130 435 men [59.7%]), 207 459 were due to cancer, and 11 063 were due to dementia. Immediately after the introduction of home-based hospice care, the rate of home deaths was 24.5% higher for patients with cancer than for those with dementia (estimate, 1.245 [95% CI, 1.030-1.504]; P = .02). The difference in the level change between cancer deaths and dementia deaths, on intervention, was more pronounced for those living in rural areas (estimate, 1.320 [95% CI, 1.118-1.558]; P = .001). In addition, a higher educational level was associated with a larger difference in the immediate effect size due to home-based hospice care (low educational level: estimate, 1.205 [95% CI, 1.025-1.416]; P = .02; middle educational level: estimate, 1.307 [95% CI, 0.987-1.730], P = .06; high educational level: estimate, 1.716 [95% CI, 0.932-3.159]; P = .08).\n",
      "In this cohort study exploring the changes in the place of death for patients with cancer after the insurance mandates for home-based hospice care in Korea, the probability of patients with cancer dying in their own homes increased after the intervention. This finding suggests the need to broaden the extent of home-based hospice care to honor the autonomy of individuals with terminal illness and improve their quality of death.\n",

      "There were 59 169 veterans with a diagnosis of IDA (mean [SD] age, 40.7 [7.1] years; 30 502 men [51.6%]), 189 185 veterans with a diagnosis of hematochezia (mean [SD] age, 39.4 [7.6] years; 163 690 men [86.5%]), and 2287 veterans with IDA and hematochezia (mean [SD] age, 41.6 [6.9] years; 1856 men [81.2%]). The cumulative 2-year diagnostic workup completion rate was 22% (95% CI, 22%-22%) among veterans with IDA and 40% (95% CI, 40%-40%) among veterans with hematochezia. Veterans with IDA were mostly aged 40 to 49 years (37 719 [63.7%]) and disproportionately Black (24 480 [41.4%]). Women with IDA (rate ratio [RR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.40-0.43) had a lower likelihood of diagnostic test completion compared with men with IDA. Black (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.62-0.68) and Hispanic (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.94) veterans with IDA were less likely to receive diagnostic testing compared with White veterans with IDA. Veterans with hematochezia were mostly White (105 341 [55.7%]). Among veterans with hematochezia, those aged 30 to 49 years were more likely to receive diagnostic testing than adults younger than 30 years of age (age 30-39 years: RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.12-1.18; age 40-49 years: RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.33-1.40).

An exploratory end point, new follow-up schedule proposal for patients with low-risk GIST according to the observed results, was also assessed.\n",
      "A total of 737 patients (377 men [51.2%]; median age at diagnosis, 63 [range, 18-86] years) with low-risk GIST were included. Estimated 5-year survival rates were 95.5% for DFS, 99.8% for GIST-SS, and 96.1% for OS. Estimated 10-year survival rates were 93.4% for DFS, 98.1% for GIST-SS, and 91.0% for OS. Forty-two patients (5.7%) experienced disease relapse during follow-up (9 local, 31 distant, 2 both), of which 9 were detected after 10 or more years. This translated into approximately 1 relapse detected for every 170 computed tomography scans performed, with a median radiation exposure of 80 (IQR, 32-112) mSv per patient. Nongastric primary tumor (hazard ratio [HR], 2.09; 95% CI, 1.14-3.83; P = .02), and KIT mutation (HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.05-7.27; P = .04) were associated with a higher risk of relapse.

In unstratified analysis, 8 hypomethylated CpG sites were identified as associated with the NDI, including sites in 2 tumor suppressor genes, LRIG1 and WWOX. Moreover, expression of the 2 genes inversely correlated with neighborhood deprivation. In the race-stratified analysis, the negative correlation between the LRIG1 gene body CpG site cg26131019 and the NDI remained significant in Black women. A neighborhood deprivation-associated decrease in gene expression was also observed for LRIG1 and WWOX in tumors from Black women.\n",
      "In this study, high neighborhood deprivation was associated with differences in tissue DNA methylation and gene expression among Black women. These findings suggest that continued investment in public health interventions and policy changes at the neighborhood level may help to remedy biological alterations that could make minoritized populations more susceptible to chronic diseases.\n",

The key findings were a high overall rate of incision and drainage (21.0 per cent) and a lower than anticipated proportion of ultrasound-guided aspiration of breast abscesses (61.0 per cent). Significant variations were observed regarding the rate of incision and drainage (range 0-100 per cent; P < 0.001) and the rate of needle aspiration (range 12.5-100 per cent; P < 0.001) between individual units. Overall, 22.5 per cent of patients were admitted for inpatient treatment, out of whom which 72.9 per cent were commenced on intravenous antibiotics. The odds of undergoing incision and drainage for a breast abscess or being admitted for inpatient treatment were significantly higher if patients presented at the weekend compared with a weekday (P ≤ 0.023). Breast specialists reviewed 40.9 per cent of all patients directly, despite the majority of patients (74.2 per cent) presenting within working hours on weekdays.\n",
      "Variation in practice exists in the management of mastitis and breast abscesses, with high rates of incision and drainage in certain regions of the UK. There is an urgent need for a national best-practice toolbox to minimize practice variation and standardize patient care.\n",
      "Mastitis and breast abscess is a painful infection of the breast. It is an extremely common breast problem. One in three women can get this condition at some stage in their life. To treat a breast abscess, the pus inside should be drained out of the body. This can be done either by cutting into the breast using surgery or by inserting a fine needle using an ultrasonography scan (which uses ultrasound). Fine-needle drainage has the benefit that it does not require admission to hospital. Surgery can cause the breast to look misshapen. It is unknown which method is used more often in the UK and Ireland. The aim of this study was to describe how mastitis and breast abscesses are treated in the UK and Ireland. This study involved a survey of practice (phase 1) and collection of data, which are routinely recorded for these patients (phase 2). This study involved 69 hospitals and 1312 patient records. One in five women had an operation for a breast abscess. This was higher than expected. Six in 10 women had a pus drainage using a fine needle. The chance of having an operation depended on the hospital. Women that came to hospital at the weekend were almost twice as likely to have an operation. One in five women were admitted to hospital. The chances of that more than doubled if a woman came to hospital at the weekend. There are differences in treatment of mastitis and breast abscesses across the UK and Ireland. Changes need to be put in place to make access to treatment more equal.\n",
      "In cancer treatment, programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitors are thriving. Activated T lymphocytes expressed PD-1, it works with its ligand PD-L1 to limit T lymphocyte activation and prevent autoimmune disease. The expression of molecular biomarkers and PD-L1 in lung cancer determines the appropriate treatment strategy for patients with lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to look at the prevalence of molecular biomarkers and PD-L1 expression in a large group of Tunisian patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We conducted an observational retrospective study in which medical/treatment history data were extracted retrospectively from medical records and archived tissue samples between January 1st 2019 and December 31st 2021. We gathered 157 patients who had recently been diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma. In 36.9%of the cases, there was no molecular genotyping. EGFR (28.6%), KRAS (5.73%), and ALK gene rearrangement were the most common genotyping mutations (3.8%). ROS1 rearrangement was not present. There was a link between EGFR and gender, HER and age, and KRAS and biopsy tissue origin. Six of the tested cases with PD-L1 met the cut-off (³50%). PD-L1 positivity was more common in solid type adenocarcinoma (1.9%) than in acinar or papillary adenocarcinoma. There were no significant differences in PD-L1 expression across clinical and demographic parameters. High PD-L1 expression and molecular abnormalities were found in 1 case of EGFR, 1 case of BRAF, and 1 case of KRAS (3 cases). All of the other specimens with abnormalities had a PD-L1 <50%. ALK, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, and MET were found to be significantly associated with PD-L1 expression. Our study is one of the country's largest, describing a large panel of biomarkers and their clinicopathologic/histopathologic associations in Tunisian lung cancer patients. We have the same molecular profile as European patients with an EGFR mutation, which is not the most common genotype abnormality in Tunisian patients. There is only one mutation at any given time. The expression of PD-L1 is determined by the histologic type and the origin of the biopsy tissue.\n",
      "Nanomedicine has significantly advanced precise tumor therapy, providing essential technical blessing for active drug accumulation, targeted consignment, and mitigation of noxious side effects. To enhance anti-tumor efficacy, the integration of multiple therapeutic modalities has garnered significant attention. Here, we designed an innovative CoFeSe2@DMSA@FA nanocatalyst with Se vacancies (abbreviated as CFSDF), which exhibits synergistic chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), leading to amplified tumor oxidative stress and enhanced photothermal effects. The multifunctional CFSDF nanocatalyst exhibits the remarkable ability to catalyze the Fenton reaction within the acidic tumor microenvironment, efficiently converting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly harmful hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Moreover, the nanocatalyst effectively diminishes GSH levels and ameliorates intracellular oxidative stress. The incorporation of FA modification enables CFSDF to evade immune detection and selectively target tumor tissues. Numerous in vitro and in vivo investigations have consistently demonstrated that CFSDF optimizes its individual advantages and significantly enhances therapeutic efficiency through synergistic effects of multiple therapeutic modalities, offering a valuable and effective approach for cancer treatment.\n",
      "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor that affects many patients diagnosed with hepatic cell inflammation and liver cirrhosis. Targeted polymeric nanocapsules could facilitate the internalization and accumulation of anticancer drugs. Dual-targeted folic acid/lactobionic acid-poly lactic co-glycolic acid nanocapsules (NCs) were prepared and loaded with pterostilbene (PTN) and characterized for their physicochemical properties, as well as in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity. NCs displayed a size of 222 nm, zeta potential of - 16.5 mV, and sustained release for 48 h. The IC50 of PTN NCs (5.87 ± 0.8 µg/mL) was 20 times lower than unencapsulated PTN (121.26 ± 9.42 µg/mL) on HepG2 liver cancer cells owing to the enhanced cellular uptake of the former, as delineated by flow cytometry. In vivo study on HCC-induced animals delineated the superiority of the dual-targeted NCs over the unencapsulated PTN, which significantly reduced the liver markers ALT, AST, and ALP, as well as the tumor-related markers AFP and Bcl2, and elevated the anti-apoptotic marker caspase 3. Furthermore, the NCs significantly reduced the oxidative stress and exhibited almost comparable histological features to the normal group. Therefore, it can be concluded that the dual-ligated folic acid/lactobionic acid nanocapsules can be considered a promising potential treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma.\n",
      "The utility of analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and disease in the bone marrow as an adjunctive tool in caring for hematologic cancer patients is expanding. This holds true for lymphoma where these biomarkers are being explored as a means of genotyping and quantifying disease. Regarding the latter, they can be used to monitor measurable residual disease (MRD) during and after treatment. This holds potential for aiding clinical decisions amidst treatment, detecting earlier relapse, and improving prognostication. Here, we review the evidence to support these applications in a variety of lymphoma subtypes.\n",
      "Numerous clinical trials across a variety of lymphomas have demonstrated value in MRD monitoring. MRD monitoring is often prognostic for progression free survival (PFS) and even overall survival (OS) at several time points in a disease course, particularly when utilizing serial measurements. With regards to tailoring treatment, there are a growing number of trials examining MRD-adaptive treatment strategies to intensify or de-escalate treatment to individualize care. Lastly, MRD monitoring has been utilized successfully in detecting earlier relapse when compared to more standard methods of clinical surveillance such as radiographic assessment. Although not routinely implemented into clinical practice, MRD monitoring in lymphoma is helping shape the future landscape of this disease by aiding in prognostication, guiding therapy, and detecting earlier relapse. Steps to standardize and further examine this technology prospectively are being taken to bring MRD monitoring to the forefront of the field.\n",
      "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been recently identified as important regulators of various diseases, especially cancer. However, the roles of circRNAs in hematologic malignancies have been rarely reported. This study aimed to identify a specific circRNA expression profile in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and to evaluate the biological roles of circRNA in MDS and AML for understanding their clinical significance. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to validate the expression of circZBTB46. Kruskal-Wallis test, Kaplan-Meier curves, and the Cox regression model were employed to analyze the clinical significance of circZBTB46. Two specific shRNAs as well as an expression lentiviral vector of circZBTB46 were constructed to identify the biological function of circZBTB46. The impact of circZBTB46 on leukemia cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis was confirmed using cell viability assay and flow cytometry analysis. The expression of circZBTB46 gradually increased in patients with higher-risk MDS and AML, as compared to controls. CircZBTB46 expression was significantly correlated with important clinical parameters of MDS, including WHO classification, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), marrow blast, IPSS karyotype, IPSS/IPSS-R risk groups, and AML transformation. CircZBTB46 expression was also associated with ANC, marrow blast, cytogenetic risk groups, FLT3-ITD mutation, and treatment response in AML patients. Furthermore, circZBTB46 overexpression was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (OS, P = 0.0342, median survival time 18.5 vs. 45.4 months) and leukemia-free survival (LFS, P = 0.0421) in MDS, also with the shorter OS in AML (P = 0.0293, median survival time 11.6 vs. 16.9 months). Functional studies revealed that silencing circZBTB46 expression significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in SKM-1, THP-1, and K562 cell lines, while rescue experiments alleviated the siRNA-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in these leukemic cells. The present data suggested the essential oncogenic role of circZBTB46, as a progression and survival indicator in both MDS and AML.\n",
      "Breast cancer is one of the most prevailing forms of cancer globally. Immunotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in improving the overall survival of breast cancer. The aim of us was to formulate a novel signature predicated on immune checkpoint-related genes (ICGs) that could anticipate the prognosis and further analyze the immune status of patients with breast cancer. After acquiring data, we pinpointed the definitive ICGs for constructing the prognostic model of breast cancer. We constructed a novel prognostic model and created a fresh risk score called Immune Checkpoint-related Risk Score in breast cancer (ICRSBC). The nomogram was constructed to evaluate the accuracy of the model, and the new web-based tool was created to be more intuitive for predicting prognosis. We also investigated immunotherapy responsiveness and analyzed the tumor mutational burden (TMB) in ICRSBC subgroups. The ICRSBC was found to have significant correlations with the immune environment, immunotherapy responsiveness, and TMB. The expression levels of the 9 ICGs that construct the prognostic model and their promoter methylation levels are significantly different between breast cancer and normal tissues. Furthermore, the mutation profiles, the copy number alterations, and the levels of protein expression also exhibit marked disparities among the 9 ICGs. We have identified and validated a novel signature related to ICGs that is strongly associated with breast cancer progression. This signature enables us to create a risk score for prognosticating the survival and assessing the immune status of individuals affected by breast cancer.\n",
      "Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most common symptom experienced by cancer survivors. It is a multidimensional symptom affecting physical, emotional, and/or cognitive spheres, different from other types of fatigue. Characteristically is not alleviated by sleep or rest. CRF could have specific features in breast cancer survivors (BCS), because of sex, hormones, and distinct treatments. On the other hand, more than 25% of BCS report persistent CRF for 10 years or more after the diagnosis. The present study aims to recapitulate the knowledge about the biological mechanisms that potentially drive CRF in BCS after treatment.\n",
      "To answer a broad question, a scoping review methodology was used. Data were collated from three bibliographic databases: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Studies were selected if they had included more than 20 BCS, after finishing their treatment, fatigue was measured with a quantitative scale and biomarkers were analyzed.\n",
      "The final database was composed of 1896 records. Sixty-four studies finally met the eligibility criteria. Inflammation (61%), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation (14%), autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction (11%), and diet (9%) were the biological pathways most frequently studied. Unfortunately, results from studies about inflammation and HPA axis show many inconsistencies.\n",
      "More research about the role of ANS dysfunction and diet on the pathogenesis of CRF would be warranted according to the results of the review. There are some fields such as endocannabinoid systems, mitochondrial dysfunction, gut microbiota, and oxidative stress that have been insufficiently explored.\n",
      "To widen the scope of future research in the physiopathology of CRF, it is necessary to identify mechanisms that would be potentially involved and have been insufficiently explored. Because of the high prevalence of CRF in BCS and the tremendous impact that fatigue has in their quality of life, it is essential to improve the efficacy of the treatments through a good knowledge of the biological basis of CRF.\n",
      "Non-excisional techniques for pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) have gained popularity over the last years. The aim of this study was to review short and long-term outcomes for non-excisional techniques with special focus on the additive effect of treatment of the inner lining of the sinus cavity and the difference between primary and recurrent PSD. A systematic search was conducted in Embase, Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases for studies on non-excisional techniques for PSD including pit picking techniques with or without additional laser or phenol treatment, unroofing, endoscopic techniques and thrombin gelatin matrix application. Outcomes were recurrence rates, healing rates, complication rates, wound healing times and time taken to return to daily activities. In total, 31 studies comprising 8100 patients were included. Non-excisional techniques had overall healing rates ranging from 67 to 100%. Recurrence rates for pit picking, unroofing and gelatin matrix application varied from 0 to 16% depending on the follow-up time. Recurrence rates after additional laser, phenol and endoscopic techniques varied from 0 to 29%. Complication rates ranged from 0 to 16%, and the wound healing time was between three and forty-seven days. The return to daily activities varied from one to nine days. Non-excisional techniques are associated with fast recovery and low morbidity but recurrence rates are high. Techniques that attempt to additionally treat the inner lining of the sinus have worse recurrence rates than pit picking alone. Recurrence rates do not differ between primary and recurrent disease.\n",
      "This study focused on the dosimetric impact of variations in respiratory motion during lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Dosimetric comparisons between volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) were performed using four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT)-based internal target volumes (ITV). We created retrospective plans for ten patients with lung cancer who underwent SBRT using 3DCRT and VMAT techniques. A Delta4 Phantom + (ScandiDos, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to evaluate the dosimetric robustness of 4DCT-based ITV against variations in respiratory motion during treatment. We analyzed respiratory motion during treatment. Dose-volume histogram parameters were evaluated for the 95% dose (D\n",

      "The 30-item European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and a study-specific questionnaire covering demographic and socioeconomic factors were answered by 684 women aged ≥ 18 years old, diagnosed in 2014, 2016, or 2018 with gynaecological cancer in the Stockholm-Gotland health care region, Sweden. Clinical data were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Register. Data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and linear regression.\n",
      "The women had a mean age of 65.4 years, with 555 (81.1%) born in Sweden, 54 (7.9%) in other Nordic countries (ONC), 43 (6.3%) in other European countries (OEC), and 32 (4.7%) in non-European countries (NEC). HRQoL differed significantly between the four groups for 14 of the 15 QLQ-C30 scales/items. On average, Swedish-born women scored 2.0, 15.2, and 16.7 points higher for QoL/functioning scales/items and 2.2, 14.1, and 18.7 points lower for symptom scales/items, compared with ONC-, OEC-, and NEC-born women, respectively. In adjusted analyses, none of the differences between Swedish-born and ONC-born women were significant, while for OEC- and NEC-born women the differences were significant for most QLQ-C30 scales/items.\n",
      "HRQoL differs between native and foreign-born gynaecological cancer patients in Sweden, with lower HRQoL the further from Sweden the women are born. A more individualised cancer care, with tailored support to optimize HRQoL is needed for this vulnerable group of patients.\n",
      "Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), a member of the Notch pathway, has been identified as a potential therapeutic target as it is highly expressed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a subtype accounting for 15% of lung cancer cases.\n",
      "A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to understand the prevalence and prognostic impact of DLL3 expression on survival of patients with SCLC and treatment response.\n",
      "Systematic literature searches were conducted across multiple databases to capture studies of any SCLC population that evaluated DLL3 expression. Specific outcomes of interest included prevalence of DLL3 expression, method of expression analysis, and impact on outcome, including treatment response and survival (overall, progression-free, disease-free) according to varying levels of DLL3 expression/positivity. Standard risk of bias tools were used to evaluate study quality.\n",
      "Among the 30 included studies, the most common DLL3 testing method was immunohistochemistry (N = 26, 86.7%). For comparability, results focused on the 13 (22.3%) studies that used the Ventana DLL3 (SP347) immunohistochemistry assay. The prevalence of DLL3 positivity ranged from 80.0-93.5% for studies using a threshold of ≥ 1% of tumor cells (N = 4) and 58.3-91.1% for studies with a ≥ 25% threshold (N = 4). DLL3 expression was generally categorized as high using cutoffs of ≥ 50% (prevalence range: 45.8-79.5%; N = 6) or ≥ 75% (prevalence range: 47.3-75.6%; N = 5) of cells with positivity. Two studies used an H-score of ≥ 150 to define high DLL3 expression with prevalence ranging from 33.3-53.1%. No consistent associations were seen between DLL3 expression level and patient age, sex, smoking history, or disease stage. Two studies reported change in DLL3 expression category (high versus low) before and after chemotherapy. No statistically significant differences were reported between DLL3 expression groups and survival (overall, progression-free, or disease-free) or treatment response.\n",
      "There is a high prevalence of DLL3 expression in SCLC. Further research and analytical methods may help to characterize different populations of patients with SCLC based on DLL3 expression. While no significant prognostic factor in the included studies was identified, additional cohort studies using standardized methodology, with longer follow-up, are needed to better characterize any potential differences in patient survival or response by DLL3 expression level in SCLC.\n",

      "Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is an evolutionarily conserved surveillance mechanism across eukaryotes and also regulates the expression of physiological transcripts, thus involved in gene regulation. It essentially ensures recognition and removal of aberrant transcripts. Therefore, the NMD protects the cellular system by restricting the synthesis of truncated proteins, potentially by eliminating the faulty mRNAs. NMD is an evolutionarily conserved surveillance mechanism across eukaryotes and also regulates the expression of physiological transcripts, thus involved in gene regulation as well. Primarily, the NMD machinery scans and differentiates the aberrant and non-aberrant transcripts. A myriad of cellular dysfunctions arise due to production of truncated proteins, so the NMD core proteins, the up-frameshift factors (UPFs) recognizes the faulty mRNAs and further recruits factors resulting in the mRNA degradation. NMD exhibits astounding variability in its ability in regulating cellular mechanisms including both pathological and physiological events. But, the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms in NMD remains blurred and require extensive investigation to gain insights on cellular homeostasis. The complexity in understanding of NMD pathway arises due to the involvement of numerous proteins, molecular interactions and their functioning in different steps of this process. Moreover methods such as alternative splicing generates numerous isoforms of mRNA, so it makes difficulties in understanding the impact of alternative splicing on the efficiency of NMD functioning. Role of NMD in cancer development is very complex. Studies have shown that in some cases cancer cells use NMD pathway as a tool to exploit the NMD mechanism to maintain tumor microenvironment. A greater level of understanding about the intricate mechanism of how tumor used NMD pathway for their benefits, a strategy can be developed for targeting and inhibiting NMD factors involved in pro-tumor activity. There are very little amount of information available about the NMD pathway, how it discriminate mRNAs that are targeted by NMD from those that are not. This review highlights our current understanding of NMD, specifically the regulatory mechanisms and attempts to outline less explored questions that warrant further investigations. Taken as a whole, a detailed molecular understanding of the NMD mechanism could lead to wide-ranging applications for improving cellular homeostasis and paving out strategies in combating pathological disorders leaping forward toward achieving United Nations sustainable development goals (SDG 3: Good health and well-being).\n",
      "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) constitutes a group of heterogeneous malignancies within the liver. We sought to subtype ICC based on anatomical origin of tumors, as well as propose modifications of the current classification system.\n",
      "Patients undergoing curative-intent resection for ICC, hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were identified from three international multi-institutional consortia of databases. Clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes were assessed.\n",
      "Among 1264 patients with ICC, 1066 (84.3%) were classified as ICC-peripheral subtype, whereas 198 (15.7%) were categorized as ICC-perihilar subtype. Compared with ICC-peripheral subtype, ICC-perihilar subtype was more often associated with aggressive tumor characteristics, including a higher incidence of nodal metastasis, macro- and microvascular invasion, perineural invasion, as well as worse overall survival (OS) (median: ICC-perihilar 19.8 vs. ICC-peripheral 37.1 months; p < 0.001) and disease-free survival (DFS) (median: ICC-perihilar 12.8 vs. ICC-peripheral 15.2 months; p = 0.019). ICC-perihilar subtype and hilar CCA had comparable OS (19.8 vs. 21.4 months; p = 0.581) and DFS (12.8 vs. 16.8 months; p = 0.140). ICC-peripheral subtype tumors were associated with more advanced tumor features, as well as worse survival outcomes versus HCC (OS, median: ICC-peripheral 37.1 vs. HCC 74.3 months; p < 0.001; DFS, median: ICC-peripheral 15.2 vs. HCC 45.5 months; p < 0.001).\n",
      "ICC should be classified as ICC-perihilar and ICC-peripheral subtype based on distinct clinicopathological features and survival outcomes.

      "Delays to breast cancer treatment can lead to more aggressive and extensive treatments, increased expenses, increased psychological distress, and poorer survival. We explored the individual and area level factors associated with the interval between diagnosis and first treatment in a population-based cohort in Queensland, Australia.\n",
      "Data from 3216 Queensland women aged 20 to 79, diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (ICD-O-3 C50) between March 2010 and June 2013 were analysed. Diagnostic dates were sourced from the Queensland Cancer Registry and treatment dates were collected via self-report. Diagnostics-treatment intervals were modelled using flexible parametric survival methods.\n",
      "The median interval between breast cancer diagnosis and first treatment was 15 days, with an interquartile range of 9-26 days. Longer diagnostic-treatment intervals were associated with a lack of private health coverage, lower pre-diagnostic income, first treatments other than breast conserving surgery, and residence outside a major city. The model explained a modest 13.7% of the variance in the diagnostic-treatment interval [Formula: see text]. Sauerbrei's D was 0.82, demonstrating low to moderate discrimination performance.\n",
      "Whilst this study identified several individual- and area-level factors associated with the time between breast cancer diagnosis and first treatment, much of the variation remained unexplained. Increased socioeconomic disadvantage appears to predict longer diagnostic-treatment intervals. Though some of the differences are small, many of the same factors have also been linked to screening and diagnostic delay. Given the potential for accumulation of delay at multiple stages along the diagnostic and treatment pathway, identifying and applying effective strategies address barriers to timely health care faced by socioeconomically disadvantaged women remains a priority.\n",
      "Serum cortisol and inflammatory markers may play a role in depression and anxiety, but little is known about whether various features of serum cortisol and inflammatory markers have different associations with depression and anxiety. This study examines the associations of serum cortisol and inflammatory marker features with depression and anxiety in young women with gynecologic cancer.\n",
      "Sixty-four young women with gynecologic cancer, aged 15-39 years, were recruited in a tertiary general hospital and a tertiary hospital specializing in oncology in China from May to December 2021. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to evaluate depression and anxiety. Blood samples were taken at 8 am, 4 pm, and 10 pm on the same day to examine the various features (average, variability, and diurnal patterns) of serum cortisol and inflammatory markers, namely C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).\n",
      "Young women with gynecologic cancer who reported depression/anxiety had significantly higher average levels of serum cortisol, IL-6 and TNF-α than those who did not. The dysregulations in the diurnal patterns of serum cortisol and IL-6 were associated with depression and anxiety. Serum cortisol levels were significantly higher in the depression/anxiety group at 10 pm. Depression and anxiety were associated with elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-α at each time point.\n",

      "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a lethal gynecologic cancer in industrialized countries. Treatments for OC include the surgical removal and chemotherapy. In the last decades, improvements have been made in the surgery technologies, drug combinations and administration protocols, and in diagnosis. However, mortality from OC is still high owing to recurrences and insurgence of drug resistance. Accordingly, it is urgent the development of novel agents capable to effectively target OC. In this respect, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may play an important role. Most of TKIs developed and tested so far are organic. However, owing to their chemical versatility, also metals can be exploited to design selective and potent TKIs. We provide a short and easy-to-read overview on the main organic TKIs with a summary of those that entered clinical trials. Additionally, we describe the potential of metal-based TKIs, focusing on this overlooked family of compounds that may significantly contribute towards the concept of precision-medicine.\n",
      "Cathepsin-K (CTSK) is overexpressed in Gastric cancer (GC) and the mechanism of its overexpression in GC is still unclear. The present work found CTSK as a potential predictive biomarker and immunotherapeutic target for GC based on the tumor microenvironment (TME).\n",

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with TME were obtained by differential analysis, followed by cross-screening to obtain CTSK as a gene associated with TME. Next, a series of methods and tools were employed to explore the relationships between clinicopathological features of GC and CTSK expression as well as prognosis, tumor immune microenvironment, immune checkpoints and drug sensitivity. And GSEA was used to investigate the potential role of CTSK in the tumor microenvironment of GC.\n",
      "From the dataset, we obtained a total of 656 DEGs associated with TME and the stromal component of TME was found to be closely involved in GC prognosis. CTSK was cross-screened as the key gene associated with TME by the PPI network and univariate Cox regression analysis. Pan-cancer analysis revealed significant high expression of CTSK in a variety of cancers. Subsequently, we hypothesized that high-expressed CTSK was closely correlated with poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis of tumors, and that CTSK, a GC TME-related gene, was largely involved in a range of biological behaviors of tumors, with a significant correlation between several immune cells.\n",
      "CTSK was validated as a potential prognostic biomarker related to TME of GC and could be a promising next-generation immunotherapeutic target for GC.\n",
      "Prehabilitation aims to improve physical condition in the preoperative period and, therefore, decrease the loss of cardiopulmonary capacity postoperatively, with the aim of reducing complications and promoting an early recovery. This study aims to evaluate the impact of home-based prehabilitation on the physical condition of patients treated surgically for colorectal cancer.\n",
      "A prospective and randomized clinical study was conducted on 60 patients during two periods from October 2018 to February 2019 and from September 2019 to September 2020, in a single university hospital. Patients were randomized into two study groups (30 per group): prehabilitation vs. standard care. Changes in physical condition, measured at diagnosis, the day before surgery, and at 6-8 weeks after surgery using the cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) were evaluated.\n",
      "Prehabilitation reduced postoperative complications (17.4% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.22) and hospital stay (5.74 vs. 6.67 days, p = 0.30). 6MWT showed a significant improvement in the prehabilitation group (+78.9 m). Six weeks after surgery, prehabilitation showed a significant improvement in the 6MWT (+68.9 m vs. -27.2 m, p = 0.01). Significant differences were also observed in the ergospirometry between the diagnosis and postoperative study (+0.79 METs vs. -0.84 METs, p = 0.001). A strong correlation was observed between CPET and 6MWT (0.767 (p < 0.001)).\n",
      "Home prehabilitation achieved lower overall postoperative complications than standard care and reached significant improvements in 6MWT and CET. A strong correlation was observed between CET and 6MWT, which allows validation of 6MWT as a valid and reliable measure of functional exercise capacity in colorectal patients when other, more specific and expensive tests are not available.\n",

      "PDZ and LIM domain protein 1 (PDLIM1) is a cytoskeletal protein and is associated with the malignant pathological features of several tumors. However, the prognostic value of PDLIM1 and the molecular mechanisms by which it is involved in the metabolism and progression in gastric cancer (GC) are still unclear. The GEPIA database was used to predict the expression and prognosis of PDLIM1 in GC. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were applied to detect the mRNA and protein expression in GC tissues and cells. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments were performed to evaluate the biological role of PDLIM1 in GC cells. The Warburg effect was detected by a battery of glycolytic indicators. The interaction of PDLIM1 and hexokinase 2 (HK2) was determined by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, the modulatory effects of PDLIM1 and HK2 on Wnt/β-catenin signaling were assessed. The results showed that PDLIM1 expression was upregulated in GC tissues and cells and was associated with a poor prognosis for GC patients. PDLIM1 inhibition reduced GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis. In the glucose deprivation (GLU-D) condition, the PDLIM1 level was reduced and PDLIM1 overexpression led to an increase in glycolysis. Besides, mechanistic investigation showed that PDLIM1 interacted with HK2 to mediate biological behaviors and the glycolysis of GC through Wnt/β-catenin signaling under glucose deprivation. In conclusion, PDLIM1 interacts with HK2 to promote gastric cancer progression by enhancing the Warburg effect via Wnt/β-catenin signaling.\n",
      "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved the outcome of patients diagnosed with inoperable recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, as only a subset of head and neck cancer patients benefit from this treatment, biomarkers predicting treatment response help guide physicians in their clinical decision-making. PD-L1 expression assessed by immunohistochemistry is the single most clinically relevant biomarker predicting response to PD-1-blocking antibodies. Here, we discuss in which clinical context assessment of PD-L1 expression is instrumental for the choice of therapy, how pathologists score it, and how it affects the approval of anti-PD-1 antibodies. Furthermore, we discuss the heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression and review technical aspects of determining this prominent biomarker-knowledge that might influence clinical decision-making.\n",
      "Cervical cancer is a huge worldwide health burden, impacting women in impoverished nations in particular. Traditional therapeutic approaches, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, frequently result in systemic toxicity and ineffectiveness. Nanomedicine has emerged as a viable strategy for targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs to cancer cells while decreasing off-target effects and increasing treatment success in recent years. Nanomedicine for cervical cancer introduces several novel aspects that distinguish it from previous treatment options such as tailored delivery system, precision targeting, combination therapies, real-time monitoring and diverse nanocarriers to overcome the limitations of one another. This abstract presents recent advances in nanomedicine-based tailored delivery systems for the treatment of cervical cancer. Liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and carbon nanotubes have all been intensively studied for their ability to transport chemotherapeutic medicines, nucleic acids, and imaging agents to cervical cancer cells. Because of the way these nanocarriers are designed, they may cross biological barriers and preferentially aggregate at the tumor site, boosting medicine concentration and lowering negative effects on healthy tissues. Surface modification of nanocarriers with targeting ligands like antibodies, peptides, or aptamers improves specificity for cancer cells by identifying overexpressed receptors or antigens on the tumor surface. Furthermore, nanomedicine-based techniques have made it possible to co-deliver numerous therapeutic drugs, allowing for synergistic effects and overcoming drug resistance. In preclinical and clinical investigations, combination treatments comprising chemotherapeutic medicines, gene therapy, immunotherapy, and photodynamic therapy have showed encouraging results, opening up new avenues for individualized and multimodal treatment regimens. Furthermore, the inclusion of contrast agents and imaging probes into nanocarrier systems has enabled real-time monitoring and imaging of treatment response. This enables the assessment of therapy efficacy, the early diagnosis of recurrence, and the optimization of treatment regimens.\n",

Anoikis is a caspase-dependent cell death process triggered by extracellular matrix (ECM) detachment, rectifies detachment-induced metabolic defects that compromise cell survival, recent study revealed the crucial role of anoikis for cancer cells to survive during metastasis. However, limited research focused on the role of anoikis in SKCM.\n",
      "Our study utilized the 27 anoikis-related genes (ARGs) to divide SKCM patients into two clusters, and obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each cluster. These DEGs were used in stepwise Cox regression analysis to develop a prediction model for SKCM patients consisting of nine ARGs, called the anoikis-related signature (ARS). Subsequently, we used the risk scores calculated from the ARS to divide SKCM patients into two groups and explored differences in immune microenvironment, immune checkpoint reactivity, and drug sensitivity between the groups.\n",
      "Nine ARGs were identified to stratify SKCM patients into two risk groups, patients in the high-risk group had a poor prognosis and suppressed immune cell infiltration. Moreover, higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules and a greater sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy drugs were observed in the low-risk group. Finally, all of the ARS hub genes were found to be upregulated in SKCM tissues and cell lines.\n",
      "A novel ARGs signature was identified for predicting the prognosis of SKCM. Based on the immune landscape associated with ARS discovered in our study, targeting ARS hub genes may be a promising treatment for SKCM.\n",
      "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Currently, standard treatment options for TNBC are limited to surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, these treatment methods are associated with a higher risk of intrinsic or acquired recurrence. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a useful and promising class of cancer therapeutics. ADCs, also known as \"biochemical missiles\", use a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to target tumor antigens and deliver a cytotoxic drug payload. Currently, several ADCs clinical studies are underway worldwide, including sacituzumab govitecan (SG), which was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of TNBC. However, due to the fact that only a small portion of TNBC patients respond to ADC therapy and often develop resistance, growing evidence supports the use of ADCs in combination with other treatment strategies to treat TNBC. In this review, we described the current utilization of ADCs and discussed the prospects of ADC combination therapy for TNBC.\n",
      "Cancer cell proliferation is affected by post-translational modifications of tubulin. Especially, overexpression or depletion of enzymes for modifications on the tubulin C-terminal region perturbs dynamic instability of the spindle body. Those modifications include processing of C-terminal amino acids of α-tubulin; detyrosination, and a removal of penultimate glutamic acid (Δ2). We previously found a further removal of the third last glutamic acid, which generates so-called Δ3-tubulin. The effects of Δ3-tubulin on spindle integrities and cell proliferation remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the impacts of forced expression of Δ3-tubulin on the structure of spindle bodies and cell division in a pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1. Overexpression of HA-tagged Δ3-tubulin impaired the morphology and orientation of spindle bodies during cell division in PANC-1 cells. In particular, spindle bending was most significantly increased. Expression of EGFP-tagged Δ3-tubulin driven by the endogenous promoter of human TUBA1B also deformed and misoriented spindle bodies. Spindle bending and condensation defects were significantly observed by EGFP-Δ3-tubulin expression. Furthermore, EGFP-Δ3-tubulin expression increased the nuclear size in a dose-dependent manner of EGFP-Δ3-tubulin expression. The expression of EGFP-Δ3-tubulin tended to slow down cell proliferation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Δ3-tubulin affects the spindle integrity and cell division.\n",

      "Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) utilizing ethiodized oil as a chemotherapy carrier has become a standard treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been adopted as a bridging and downstaging therapy for liver transplantation. Water-in-oil emulsion made up of ethiodized oil and chemotherapy solution is retained in tumor vasculature resulting in high tissue drug concentration and low systemic chemotherapy doses. The density and distribution pattern of ethiodized oil within the tumor on post-treatment imaging are predictive of the extent of tumor necrosis and duration of response to treatment. This review describes the multiple roles of ethiodized oil, particularly in its role as a biomarker of tumor response to cTACE. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With the increasing complexity of locoregional therapy options, including the use of combination therapies, treatment response assessment has become challenging; Ethiodized oil deposition patterns can serve as an imaging biomarker for the prediction of treatment response, and perhaps predict post-treatment prognosis. KEY POINTS: • Treatment response assessment after locoregional therapy to hepatocellular carcinoma is fraught with multiple challenges given the varied post-treatment imaging appearance. • Ethiodized oil is unique in that its' radiopacity can serve as an imaging biomarker to help predict treatment response. • The pattern of deposition of ethiodozed oil has served as a mechanism to detect portions of tumor that are undertreated and can serve as an adjunct to enhancement in order to improve management in patients treated with intraarterial embolization with ethiodized oil.\n",
      "In patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma (LARC), negative nodal status after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) may allow for rectum-sparing protocols rather than total mesorectal excision; however, current MRI criteria for nodal staging have suboptimal accuracy. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of different MRI dimensional criteria for nodal staging after nCRT in patients with LARC.\n",
      "Patients who underwent MRI after nCRT for LARC followed by surgery were retrospectively included and divided into a training and a validation cohort of 100 and 39 patients, respectively. Short-, long-, and cranial-caudal axes and volume of the largest mesorectal node and nodal status based on European Society of Gastrointestinal Radiology consensus guidelines (i.e., ESGAR method) were assessed by two radiologists independently. Inter-reader agreement was assessed in the training cohort. Histopathology was the reference standard. ROC curves and the best cut-off were calculated, and accuracies compared with the McNemar test.\n",
      "The study population included 139 patients (median age 62 years [IQR 55-72], 94 men). Inter-reader agreement was high for long axis (κ = 0.81), volume (κ = 0.85), and ESGAR method (κ = 0.88) and low for short axis (κ = 0.11). Accuracy was similar (p > 0.05) for long axis, volume, and ESGAR method both in the training (71%, 74%, and 65%, respectively) and in the validation (83%, 78%, and 75%, respectively) cohorts.\n",
      "Accuracy of the measurement of long axis and volume of the largest lymph node is not inferior to the ESGAR method for nodal staging after nCRT in LARC.\n",
      "In MRI restaging of rectal cancer, measurement of the long axis or volume of largest mesorectal lymph node after preoperative chemoradiotherapy is a faster and reliable alternative to ESGAR criteria for nodal staging.\n",
      "• Current MRI criteria for nodal staging in locally advanced rectal cancer after chemo-radiotherapy have suboptimal accuracy and are time-consuming. • Measurement of long axis or volume of the largest mesorectal lymph node on MRI showed good accuracy for assessment of loco-regional nodal status in locally advanced rectal cancer. • MRI measurement of the long axis and volume of largest mesorectal lymph node after chemo-radiotherapy could be a faster and reliable alternative to ESGAR criteria for nodal staging.\n",
      "Skin cancers are the most common human neoplasms with head and neck localization in 90% of cases. Primary therapy is surgery, resulting in absolute skin defects in a number of cases. The reconstruction of these is performed with local skin flaps showing identical colour, texture and follicle density with the defect site.\n",
      "In the present study, we report our preliminary experience with the head and neck application of double hatchet flap, a random pattern flap.\n",
      "In our study, results of patients undergoing double hatchet flap reconstruction in the period between November 2021 and June 2023 were analyzed prospectively in terms of tumor site, defect size, method of anesthesia, and early and late complication rates. Patients followed up to a minimum of 6 months were asked to fill in a questionnaire concerning their postoperative status.\n",
      "A total of 13 patients with a mean age of 79.6 years underwent double hatchet flap reconstruction. The most frequent defect site was the scalp and the mean defect size was 40.5 × 32.1 mm. Histopathological examination showed R0 resection of the tumor in each case. The closure of the skin defect was insufficient in 1 case. Partial flap necrosis and mimical paralysis were observed as early and late complications in 2 cases, respectively. The most bothersome sequel reported by patients was scarring.\n",
      "For selection of a local flap, the following factors need to be considered: localization and size of the defect, skin elasticity, amount of adjacent skin to mobilize, direction of relaxed skin tension lines and wrinkles, and aesthetic units. If the principles of the hatchet flap design (the ratio of flap length and width and pedicle width to the defect size) are adhered, the resulting technique is reliable with an acceptable complication rate.\n",

      "Bevezetés: A bőr rosszindulatú daganatai a leggyakoribb humán neoplasmák, melyeknek 90%-a a fej-nyaki régióban jelentkezik. Elsődleges terápiájuk a műtéti eltávolítás, melynek során gyakran alakul ki valódi bőrhiány. Ennek zárása ideális esetben színében, vastagságában és szőrtüszőtartalmában a laesio kiindulási helyével megegyező helyi lebenyekkel történik. Célkitűzés: Jelen munkánkban egy random vérellátású helyi lebeny, a kettős bárdlebeny alkalmazásával kapcsolatos első tapasztalatainkról számolunk be. Módszer: A 2021. november és 2023. június között a fej-nyaki bőrtumor eltávolítása utáni defektus kettős bárdlebennyel történő zárásán átesett betegeket prospektív módon követtük. Vizsgáltuk a primer tumor lokalizációját, méretét, az anesztézia módját, továbbá a korai és késői szövődmények előfordulását. A műtét után legalább 6 hónapig követett betegek esetében egy, a műtét utáni statusra vonatkozó elégedettségi kérdőívet töltettünk ki. Eredmények: A vizsgált időszakban 13 beteget operáltunk a kettős bárdlebeny technikájával, átlagéletkoruk 79,6 év volt. A leggyakoribb lokalizáció a skalp volt, a reszekátumok átlagos mérete 40,5 × 32,1 mm volt. Valamennyi esetben R0-reszekciót végeztünk. 1 esetben a defektus teljes zárása nem volt lehetséges. Korai szövődményként 2 betegben részleges lebenynekrózist, késői következményként 2 betegben mimikai mozgászavart észleltünk. A betegek számára a legzavaróbb következmény a hegesedés volt. Megbeszélés: A helyi lebeny kiválasztásakor a defektus elhelyezkedése, mérete, mélysége, a bőr elaszticitása, a defektus környezetében mobilizálható bőr mennyisége, a Langer-féle erővonalak és a ráncok iránya, a szőrzet (hajas fejbőr és szemöldök), valamint az arc esztétikai egységeinek és alegységeinek határai a meghatározó tényezők. Amennyiben a kettős bárdlebeny kialakításának alapelveit betartjuk (hossz és szélesség aránya, a lebeny nyelének szélessége a defektus méretéhez képest), elfogadható szövődményrátával rendelkező, megbízható módszer áll rendelkezésünkre.

      "Given their fundamental physiological importance, their involvement in the immune system, and their close association with the development of intestinal diseases, the interest in intestinal epithelial cells has increased significantly over the past fifteen years. Their close association with intestinal worm and protozoan infections - a significant 2016 discovery - has further stimulated research into uncommon chemosensitive tuft epithelial cells. Although their numbers are relatively low, tuft cells are now recognized as an essential sentinel of the gastrointestinal tract, as their taste receptors for succinate, sweet, and bitter continuously monitor intestinal contents. When stimulated, tuft cells release a number of effector molecules, including immunomodulatory molecules like interleukin 25, prostaglandins E2 and D2, cysteinyl leukotriene C4, acetylcholine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and beta-endorphins. Tuft cells have been shown to be crucial for immunity against nematodes and protozoa. The majority of tuft cell research has used the doublecortin-like (microtubule-linked) kinase 1 protein marker on mice; however, the expression of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1 may help identify human intestinal tuft cells. Few studies have examined the association between tuft cells and intestinal diseases in humans. This article provides an update on intestinal epithelial tuft cells, including their physiology, immunological nodal function, and role in human diseases. We conclude by discussing the potential clinical therapeutic value of tuft cells. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(44): 1727-1735.\n",

      "Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is inextricably linked to various diseases, including liver cancer. Thus, detecting the content of AFP in biology has great significance in diagnosis, treatment, and intervention. Motivated by the urgent need for affordable and convenient electronic sensors in the analysis and detection of aqueous biological samples, we combined the solution-gated graphene transistor (SGGT) with the catalytic reaction of enzyme nanoprobes (HRP-AuNPs-Ab2) to accurately sense AFP. The SGGT immunosensor demonstrated high specificity and stability, excellent selectivity, and excessive linearity over a range of 4 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL, with the lower detection limit down to 1.03 ng/mL. Finally, clinical samples were successfully detected by the SGGT immunosensor, and the results were consistent with chemiluminescence methods that are popular in hospitals for detecting AFP. Notably, the SGGT immunosensor is also recyclable, so it has excellent potential for use in high-throughput detection.\n",
      "Although mutations in the SCRIB gene lead to multiple morphological organ defects in vertebrates, the molecular pathway linking SCRIB to organ shape anomalies remains elusive. Here, we study the impact of SCRIB-targeted gene mutations during the formation of the gut epithelium in an organ-on-chip model. We show that SCRIB KO gut-like epithelia are flatter with reduced exposed surface area. Cell differentiation on filters further shows that SCRIB plays a critical role in the control of apical cell shape, as well as in the basoapical polarization of myosin light chain localization and activity. Finally, we show that SCRIB serves as a molecular scaffold for SHROOM2/4 and ROCK1 and identify an evolutionary conserved SHROOM binding site in the SCRIB carboxy-terminal that is required for SCRIB function in the control of apical cell shape. Our results demonstrate that SCRIB plays a key role in epithelial morphogenesis by controlling the epithelial apical contractility during cell differentiation.\n",
      "B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a multistep disease characterized by the hierarchical acquisition of genetic alterations. However, the question of how a primary oncogene reprograms stem cell-like properties in committed B cells and leads to a preneoplastic population remains unclear. Here, we used the PAX5::ELN oncogenic model to demonstrate a causal link between the differentiation blockade, the self-renewal, and the emergence of preleukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs). We show that PAX5::ELN disrupts the differentiation of preleukemic cells by enforcing the IL7r/JAK-STAT pathway. This disruption is associated with the induction of rare and quiescent pre-LSCs that sustain the leukemia-initiating activity, as assessed using the H2B-GFP model. Integration of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data reveals that those quiescent pre-LSCs lose B cell identity and reactivate an immature molecular program, reminiscent of human B-ALL chemo-resistant cells. Finally, our transcriptional regulatory network reveals the transcription factor EGR1 as a strong candidate to control quiescence/resistance of PAX5::ELN pre-LSCs as well as of blasts from human B-ALL.\n",

      "Recent research indicates that multiple sclerosis is preceded by a prodromal phase with elevated levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), a marker of axonal injury. The effect of environmental risk factors on the extent of axonal injury during this prodrome is unknown. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study was to determine if HHV-6A serostatus is associated with the level of sNfL in the multiple sclerosis prodrome, which would support a causative role of HHV-6A. A nested case-control study was performed by crosslinking multiple sclerosis registries with Swedish biobanks. Individuals with biobank samples collected before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis were included as cases. Controls without multiple sclerosis were randomly selected, matched for biobank, sex, sampling date and age. Serostatus of HHV-6A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was analysed with a bead-based multiplex assay. The concentration of sNfL was analysed with Single molecule array technology. The association between HHV-6A serology and sNfL was assessed by stratified t-tests and linear regressions, adjusted for EBV serostatus and sampling age. Within-pair ratios of HHV-6A seroreactivity and sNfL were calculated for each case and its matched control. To assess the temporal relationship between HHV-6A antibodies and sNfL, these ratios were plotted against the time to the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis and compared using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing regressions with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Samples from 519 matched case-control pairs were included. In cases, seropositivity of HHV-6A was significantly associated with the level of sNfL (+11%, 95% CI 0.2-24%, P = 0.045), and most pronounced in the younger half of the cases (+24%, 95% CI 6-45%, P = 0.007). No such associations were observed among the controls. Increasing seroreactivity against HHV-6A was detectable before the rise of sNfL (significant within-pair ratios from 13.6 years vs 6.6 years before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis). In this study, we describe the association between HHV-6A antibodies and the degree of axonal injury in the multiple sclerosis prodrome. The findings indicate that elevated HHV-6A antibodies both precede and are associated with a higher degree of axonal injury, supporting the hypothesis that HHV-6A infection may contribute to multiple sclerosis development in a proportion of cases.\n",

      "The authors sought to compare HRQOL in people with HF vs those with lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers.\n",
      "The authors performed a pooled analysis of Medicare Health Outcomes Survey data from 2016 to 2020 in participants ≥65 years of age with a self-reported history of HF or active treatment for lung, colon, breast, or prostate cancer. They used the Veterans RAND-12 physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS), which range from 0-100 with a mean score of 50 (based on the U.S. general population) and an SD of 10. The authors used pairwise Student's t-tests to evaluate for differences in PCS and MCS between groups.\n",
      "Among participants with HF (n = 71,025; 54% female, 16% Black), mean PCS was 29.5 and mean MCS 47.9. Mean PCS was lower in people with HF compared with lung (31.2; n = 4,165), colorectal (35.6; n = 4,270), breast (37.7; n = 14,542), and prostate (39.6; n = 17,670) cancer (all P < 0.001). Participants with HF had a significantly lower mean MCS than those with lung (31.2), colon (50.0), breast (52.0), and prostate (53.0) cancer (all P < 0.001).\n",
      "People with HF experience worse HRQOL than those with cancer actively receiving treatment. The pervasiveness of low HRQOL in HF underscores the need to implement evidence-based interventions that target physical and mental health status and scale multidisciplinary clinics.\n",

      "We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=26) of dog visits versus usual care among pediatric oncology inpatients. Psychological functioning and microbial load from hand wash samples were evaluated. Parental anxiety was a secondary outcome.\n",
      "We did not observe a difference in the adjusted mean present functioning score (-3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], -12.4 to 6.4). The difference in microbial load on intervention versus control hands was -0.04 (95% CI, -0.60 to 0.52) log10 CFU/mL, with an upper 95% CI limit below the prespecified noninferiority margin. Anxiety was lower in parents of intervention versus control patients.\n",
      "We did not detect an effect of dog visits on functioning; however, our study was underpowered by low recruitment. Visits improved parental anxiety. With hand sanitization, visits did not increase hand microbial levels.\n",

      "Lung-targeting RNA-carrying lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are often intravenously administered and accumulate in the pulmonary endothelium. However, most respiratory diseases are localized in the airway or the alveolar epithelium. Inhalation has been explored as a more direct delivery method, but it presents its own challenges. We believe that one reason LNPs have failed to transfect RNA into alveolar epithelial cells is their interaction with the lung surfactant (LS). We propose that inhalable LNP design should take inspiration from biological agents and other nanoparticles to overcome this barrier. Screening should first focus on LS penetration and then be optimized for cell uptake and endosomal release. This will enable more efficient applications of RNA-LNPs in lung diseases.\n",
      "11q13 amplification is a frequent event in human cancer and in particular in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Despite almost invariably spanning 10 genes, it is unclear which genetic components of the amplicon are the key driver events in SCC. A combination of computational, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models leveraging efficient primary human keratinocyte genome editing by Cas9-RNP electroporation, identified ORAOV1, CCND1, and MIR548K as the critical drivers of the amplicon in head and neck SCC. CCND1 amplification drives the cell cycle in a CDK4/6/RB1-independent fashion and may confer a novel dependency on RRM2. MIR548K contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Finally, we identify ORAOV1 as an oncogene that acts likely via its ability to modulate reactive oxygen species. Thus, the 11q13 amplicon drives SCC through at least three independent genetic elements and suggests therapeutic targets for this morbid and lethal disease. Implications: This work demonstrates novel mechanisms and ways to target these mechanisms underlying the most common amplification in squamous cell carcinoma, one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of human cancer.\n",
      "This study aimed to develop a prognostic model for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) associated with mitotic cell cycle. The model will predict the probability of survival at different time points and serve as a reference tool to evaluate the effectiveness of LUAD treatment.\n",
      "A cohort of 442 patients with LUAD from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database was randomly divided into a training group (n = 299) and a validation group (n = 99). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-COX algorithm was used to reduce the number of predictors based on the clinicopathological and RNA sequencing data to establish mutant characteristics that could predict patient survival. Additionally, gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), gene set variation analysis (GSVA), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analyses were conducted on the mutant characteristics. The performance of the developed nomogram was evaluated using calibration curves and the C-index.\n",
      "The mutant characteristics had prognostic value for LUAD and acted as an independent prognostic factor. The mutant characteristics profile derived from the LASSO-COX algorithm demonstrated a significant association with overall survival in patients with LUAD. Functional annotation based on the mutant score, its involvement in the phase transition of the mitotic cell cycle, and its regulatory processes. The nomogram, which combined the mutant score with clinical factors associated with prognosis, showed robust accuracy in both the training and validation groups.\n",

      "Pilot study of a pragmatic two-arm clinical trial: an acupuncture group received systemic acupuncture, auriculotherapy, and antiemetic protocol; a control group used antiemetic protocol. The sample consisted of 42 patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal system or multiple myeloma. The outcome was assessed using the Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Assessment Tool and the patient's diary.\n",
      "There was no statistically significant difference between groups according to the assessment of the patient's diary and the Assessment Tool of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The patients were 60 years old on average and the groups were homogeneous, except for marital status. In the diary, there was no statistical difference between groups and sessions for days of nausea (p = 0.873) and vomiting episodes (p = 0.993).\n",

      "Prostate cancer represents a significant global health issue, yet our understanding of its impact in the Middle East remains limited. This study aimed to assess the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in the Middle East, and compare these rates to those in Europe and North America.\n",
      "We utilized the 2020 Global Cancer Observatory data, compiling incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer in 20 Middle Eastern countries. We calculated mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIR) and compared the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and MIR between the Middle East and the combined regions of North America and Europe. The countries were further stratified based on the Human Development Index (HDI) and income level for additional analysis.\n",
      "In 2020, the Middle East documented an estimated 51,649 new prostate cancer diagnoses, accounting for 3.7% of global cases. Despite a significantly lower ASIR in the Middle East compared with Europe and North America (10.50 vs. 21.50, p = 0.0087), the region had a higher MIR (12.35 vs. 3.00, p = 0.0476). When stratified based on HDI or income levels, there was no significant difference in MIRs; however, a significant trend of increasing MIR with decreasing HDI (p = 0.028) and income levels (p = 0.016) was observed.\n",
      "Despite a lower incidence, our analysis showed a significantly higher MIR for prostate cancer in the Middle East compared with Europe and North America. These findings underscore the unique challenges posed by prostate cancer in the Middle East and emphasize the necessity of tailored strategies to address this pressing public health issue.\n",
      "We propose a glucose-powered Janus nanomotor where two faces are functionalized with glucose oxidase (GOx) and polydopamine-Fe3+ chelates (PDF), respectively. In the glucose fuel solution, the GOx on the one side of these Janus nanomotors catalytically decomposes glucose fuels into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to drive them at a speed of 2.67 μm/s. The underlying propulsion mechanism is the glucose-based self-diffusiophoresis owing to the generated local glucose concentration gradient by the enzymatic reaction. Based on the enhanced diffusion motion, such nanomotors with catalytic activity increase the contact probability towards cells and subsequently exhibit excellent capabilities for Fe3+ ions delivery and H2O2 generation for enhancing ferroptosis efficiency for inducing cancer cell death. In particular, the Fe3+ ions are released from nanomotors in a slightly acidic environment, and subsequently generate toxic hydroxyl radicals via Fenton reactions, which accumulation reactive oxygen species (ROS) level (~300%) and further lipid peroxidation (LPO) strengthened ferroptosis therapy for cancer treatment. Such a pH-sensitive nanomotor with efficient diffusion can exhibit Fe ions overloading and sufficient H2O2 to promote ferroptosis efficiency, which provides great potential for future cancer precise therapy.\n",
      "Precise delivery of radionuclides and anticancer drugs to tumor tissue is crucial to ensuring drug synergism and optimal therapeutic effects in radionuclide-based combination radio-chemotherapy. However, current codelivery vectors often rely on physical embedment/adsorption to load anticancer drugs, which lacks precise mechanisms for drug loading and release, resulting in unpredictable combination effects. Herein, a macrocyclic-albumin conjugate (MAC) that enables precise loading and controlled release of anticancer drugs is presented. By conjugating multiple macrocyclic hosts (sulfonate azocalix[4]arenes, SAC4A) to albumin molecules, the MAC facilitates the precise loading of anticancer drugs through host-guest interactions and site-specific labeling of radionuclides. Furthermore, the MAC degrades under hypoxic conditions, enabling the release of loaded drugs upon reaching tumor tissues. Through precise loading and targeted delivery of radionuclides and anticancer drugs, MAC achieves efficient cancer diagnosis and combined radio-chemotherapy in breast cancer cell (4T1)-bearing mice. Considering that SAC4A can load many anticancer drugs, MAC may provide a promising platform for effective combination radio-chemotherapy.\n",
      "Multiple studies have identified pathogenic germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes (CSGs) in Chinese lung cancer patients; however, accurate assessment of these variants' contributions to cancer predisposition is always hampered by the absence of data on the prevalence of these variants in the general population. It is necessary to conduct a large-scale case-control study to identify CSGs that significantly increase the risk of lung cancer.\n",
      "We performed targeted sequencing of a CSGs panel in 1117 lung cancer patients and 16,327 controls from the general Chinese population.\n",
      "In comparison to controls, lung cancer patients had a considerably higher prevalence of pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variations. Among lung cancer patients, 72% of P/LP variants carriers did not have a family cancer history, who would be ignored if germline testing was only provided for patients meeting family history-based criteria. Furthermore, compared to individuals with late-onset lung cancer, patients with early-onset lung cancer had a considerably higher prevalence of P/LP variations. With odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 4-fold (BRCA1: OR, 4.193; 95%CI, 1.382-10.768) to 29-fold (TP53: OR, 29.281; 95%CI, 1.523-1705.506), P/LP variants in the BRCA1 and TP53 genes were discovered to be strongly related to increased lung cancer risk. Additionally, with ORs ranging from 7.322-fold to infinity, we discovered 23 variations previously categorized as non-P/LP variants were highly enriched in lung cancer patients.\n",

      "Purpose Ferroptosis and cuproptosis are both metal-dependent regulated cell death that play an important role in cancer. However, the expression patterns and the prognostic values of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) associated with cuproptosis in breast cancer (BC) are largely unknown. This study aims to explore the prognostic value of cuproptosis-related FRGs and their relationship with tumor microenvironments in BC. Methods The clinical and RNA sequencing data of BC patients from TCGA, METABRIC and GEO databases were analyzed. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis was used to establish prognostic signatures based on cuproptosis-related FRGs. The overall survival between risk subgroups was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The changes in risk score during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and differences in immune cells, immune checkpoints, and drug sensitivity between risk subgroups were also analyzed in this study. Results A successful development of a prognostic signature based on cuproptosis-related FRGs in the TCGA cohort was achieved and it was validated in the METABRIC cohort. Gene set enrichment analysis results revealed the enrichment of steroid biosynthesis and ABC transporters in the high-risk group. Moreover, the signature was also found to be associated with immune cells and immune checkpoints. Lower risk score in patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and higher sensitivity of the high-risk group to AKT inhibitor VIII and cisplatin was also observed. Conclusion Cuproptosis-related FRGs can be used as a novel prognostic signature for predicting the overall survival of BC patients. This can provide meaningful insights into the selection of immunotherapy and antitumor drugs for BC.\n",

      "A cross-sectional study was conducted across three specialist melanoma centres in Sydney, Australia. Melanoma patients (all stages) and clinicians completed mixed methods surveys seeking socio-demographic and clinical information and questionnaires to assess satisfaction with telehealth. Additionally, patients completed measures of quality of life, fear of cancer recurrence and trust in their oncologist. Patients and clinicians provided open-ended responses to qualitative questions about their perceptions of telehealth.\n",
      "One hundred and fifteen patients and 13 clinicians responded to surveys. Telephone was used by 109 (95%) patients and 11 (85%) clinicians. Fifty-seven (50%) patients and nine (69%) clinicians preferred face-to-face consultations, 38 (33%) patients and 3 (23%) clinicians preferred a combination of face-to-face and telehealth consultations. Five (4%) patients and nil clinicians preferred telehealth consultations. Patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma, using telehealth for the first time, who have lower trust in their oncologist, and having higher care delivery, communication and supportive care concerns were likely to report lower satisfaction with telehealth. Open-ended responses were consistent between patients and clinicians, who reported safety, convenience and improved access to care as major benefits, while identifying personal, interpersonal, clinical and system-related disadvantages.\n",
      "While telehealth has been widely implemented during COVID-19, the benefits identified by patients and clinicians may extend past the pandemic. Telehealth may be considered for use in conjunction with face-to-face consultations to provide melanoma follow-up care.\n",

      "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed during pregnancy. Breast cancer during pregnancy or within the first postpartum year is commonly described as Pregnancy-Associated Breast Cancer (PABC). PABC often exhibits poorer histopathologic features and has a worse prognosis when compared to young breast cancer patients without a current or recent pregnancy. Here, we describe two cases of PABC in which the presenting symptoms of the patients were interpreted as pregnancy-related changes, causing a diagnostic delay. Therefore, we argue that every pregnant or postpartum woman with changes in the breast must be thoroughly evaluated to exclude the possibility of a malignancy. In case of any suspicion, patients must be referred to a breast cancer center for further evaluation.\n",
      "Nemtabrutinib is an orally bioavailable, reversible inhibitor of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and C481S mutant BTK. We evaluated safety, pharmacology, and antitumor activity of nemtabrutinib in relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Forty-eight patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), relapsed/refractory after ≥2 prior therapies were enrolled in the open-label, single-arm, phase 1 MK-1026-001 study (NCT03162536) to receive nemtabrutinib 5 mg to 75 mg once-daily in 28-day cycles. Dose finding progressed using a 3+3 dose escalation design. Primary endpoints were safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Among 47 treated patients, 29 had CLL, 17 had NHL, and 1 had WM. Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 37 (89%), most commonly neutropenia (11 [23.4%]), febrile neutropenia (7 [14.9%]), and pneumonia (7 [14.9%]). The RP2D was 65 mg daily. An overall response rate of 75% was observed in patients with CLL at 65 mg daily.\n",
      "Anesthesiologists are experiencing unprecedented levels of workplace stress and staffing shortages. This analysis aims to assess how U.S. attending anesthesiologist burnout changed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and target well-being efforts.\n",
      "The authors surveyed the American Society of Anesthesiologists' U.S. attending anesthesiologist members in November 2022. Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey with additional questions relating to workplace and demographic factors. Burnout was categorized as high risk for burnout (exhibiting emotional exhaustion and/or depersonalization) or burnout syndrome (demonstrating all three burnout dimensions concurrently). The association of burnout with U.S. attending anesthesiologist retention plans was analyzed, and associated factors were identified.\n",
      "Of 24,680 individuals contacted, 2,698 (10.9%) completed the survey, with 67.7% (1,827 of 2,698) at high risk for burnout and 18.9% (510 of 2,698) with burnout syndrome. Most (78.4%, n = 2,115) respondents have experienced recent staffing shortages, and many (36.0%, n = 970) were likely to leave their job within the next 2 yr. Those likely to leave their job in the next 2 yr had higher prevalence of high risk for burnout (78.5% [760 of 970] vs. 55.7% [651 of 1,169], P < 0.001) and burnout syndrome (24.3% [236 of 970] vs. 13.3% [156 of 1,169], P < 0.001) compared to those unlikely to leave. On multivariable analysis, perceived lack of support at work (odds ratio, 9.2; 95% CI, 7.0 to 12.1), and staffing shortages (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.57 to 2.43) were most strongly associated with high risk for burnout. Perceived lack of support at work (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% CI, 3.81 to 10.4) was the factor most strongly associated with burnout syndrome.\n",
      "Burnout is more prevalent in anesthesiology since early 2020, with workplace factors of perceived support and staffing being the predominant associated variables. Interventions focused on the drivers of burnout are needed to improve well-being among U.S. attending anesthesiologists.\n",
      "This study aimed to ascertain if the incorporation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with chemotherapy (CTx) offered any advantages for patients diagnosed with stage pT3N0 rectal cancer located in the proximal (upper) region following a complete total mesorectum excision (TME).\n",
      "We retrospectively examined medical records of stage II/III rectal cancer patients who had undergone CTx or concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) with IMRT after a successful TME. We juxtaposed a variety of survival outcomes across two patient cohorts. Each outcome was further classified according to Gunderson's risk stratification between proximal and distal (middle and low) rectal cancer patients, and we evaluated the factors associated with each outcome.\n",
      "The median follow-up duration was 4.9 years. Our research comprised 236 rectal adenocarcinoma patients treated at our institution between 2007 and 2019. They received either the CTx (n = 135) or the CCRT (n = 101) with 10-year locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) of 90.1% and 96.1%, respectively (p = 0.163). However, after performing multivariate adjustments, a pattern emerged hinting at a better LRRFS for the CCRT group (p = 0.052). Perforation had a strong correlation with locoregional recurrence. No significant differences were observed in other survival between the two treatment arms and their respective subgroups. The CCRT group witnessed significantly higher immediate and chronic complications with p = 0.007 and 0.009, respectively. The CCRT group had two secondary cancer-related fatalities (2%, one attributed to IMRT), and another reported by the CTx group (1%). The sole classified locoregional recurrence within the cohort of 37 individuals treated with CTx for proximal pT3N0 rectal cancer was, in fact, the development of sigmoid colon cancer.\n",
      "The results suggest that for patients with proximal pT3N0 rectal cancer post-TME, IMRT is better when not combined with CTx, except in highly perilous scenarios or those involving perforation.\n",
      "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combination therapies have shown promise in the first-line treatment of advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). However, the best partner remains to be validated. Moreover, progress on biomarkers predicting the efficacy of ICI in BTC is slow. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and investigate reliable predictive biomarkers of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody combination therapy in the first-line treatment of advanced BTC.\n",
      "Clinical data from patients with advanced BTC who received chemotherapy or anti-PD-1 combination therapy as first-line were collected. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Biomarkers, including peripheral blood inflammation scores, genetic alterations, and tumor microenvironment were investigated.\n",
      "Sixty-four patients were recruited and divided into four treatment groups: chemotherapy, anti-PD-1 plus chemotherapy, anti-PD-1 plus targeted therapy, and triple group (anti-PD-1 plus chemotherapy and targeted therapy). The median OS was 7.9, 11.3, 12.8, and 28.7 months, respectively. Compared to chemotherapy, mOS significantly prolonged in the triple group (p = 0.031). It showed that patients with five different peripheral blood inflammation scores had significantly prolonged mOS (p < 0.05). Genetic testing results suggested that patients with poor survival all had TP53 mutations and higher levels of KRAS and ERBB2 mutations. Low FOXP3/CD8 ratio was associated with prolonged OS (p = 0.029). With CD4-low, CD8-high, CD56-positive, CD163-high, FOXP3-high and MPO-high in TME as one factor, we calculated PLUS score according to the number of factors. The high-PLUS (>2) group showed significantly superior OS (p = 0.003).\n",
      "First-line anti-PD-1 combination therapy was superior to chemotherapy, and triple therapy significantly improved survival. Peripheral blood immune-inflammation score, FOXP3/CD8 ratio, and PLUS have potential as biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of first-line anti-PD-1 therapy in advanced BTC.\n",
      "Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures relevant to domains most important to patients with HCC who received locoregional therapies are needed to advance patient-centered research. Furthermore, electronic PRO monitoring in clinical care has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and deaths in patients with other cancers. We conducted a qualitative study among patients with HCC who recently received locoregional therapies to (1) identify common and distressing posttreatment symptoms to prioritize PRO domain selection and (2) gauge interest in an electronic PRO symptom monitoring system.\n",
      "We performed semi-structured telephone interviews among adult patients who received locoregional therapies (median of 26 days after treatment) for treatment-naïve HCC at a single tertiary care center. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Qualitative content analysis was conducted to identify emerging themes and sub-themes.\n",
      "Ten of 26 patients (38%) reported at least 1 symptom before treatment. In contrast, all participants (n = 26) with recently treated HCC reported at least 1 posttreatment physical symptom, with the most common being appetite loss (73%), fatigue (58%), abdominal pain (46%), and nausea (35%). Most participants (77%) stated they saw potential benefits in posttreatment ePRO symptom monitoring.\n",
      "Posttreatment symptoms after HCC locoregional therapies are common and often severe. These data can inform and prioritize PRO domain selection. Patients are interested in ePRO monitoring to monitor and proactively address posttreatment symptoms.

      "Preclinical studies show that activation of AMP kinase by phenformin can augment the cytotoxic effect and RAF inhibitors in BRAF V600-mutated melanoma. We conducted a phase Ib dose-escalation trial of phenformin with standard dose dabrafenib/trametinib in patients with metastatic BRAF V600-mutated melanoma.\n",
      "We used a 3+3 dose escalation design which explored phenformin doses between 50 mg and 200 mg bid. Patients also received standard dose dabrafenib/trametinib. We measured phenformin pharmacokinetics and assessed the effect of treatment on circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).\n",
      "18 patients were treated at dose levels ranging from 50 mg bid to 200 mg bid. The planned dose-escalation phase had to be cancelled because of the COVID 19 pandemic. The most common toxicities were nausea/vomiting; there were 2 cases of reversible lactic acidosis. Responses were seen in 10/18 patients overall (56%) and in 2/8 patients who had received prior therapy with RAF inhibitor. Pharmacokinetic data confirmed drug bioavailability. MDSCs were measured in 7 patients treated at the highest dose levels and showed MDSC levels declined on study drug in 6/7 patients.\n",
      "We identified the recommended phase 2 dose of phenformin as 50 mg bid when administered with dabrafenib/trametinib, although some patients will require short drug holidays. We observed a decrease in MDSCs, as predicted by preclinical studies, and may enhance immune recognition of melanoma cells.\n",
      "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) Abs are a revolutionary class of cancer treatment, but only ∼30% of patients receive a lasting benefit from therapy. Preclinical studies using animals from the same genetic backgrounds, challenged with the same cancer models, also show nonuniform responses. Most mouse studies that have evaluated tumor-infiltrating leukocytes after ICI therapy cannot directly correlate their findings with treatment outcomes, because terminal methods were used to acquire immune infiltrate data. In the present study, we used fine-needle aspiration (a nonterminal sampling method) to collect multiple aspirates over several days from s.c. implanted P815, CT26, and 4T1 mouse cancer models treated with ICI Abs. These aspirates were then analyzed with flow cytometry to directly correlate tumor-infiltrating leukocyte populations with treatment success. We found that the P815 and CT26 models respond well to anti-CTLA4 therapies. Among P815-challenged animals, mice that regressed following anti-CTLA4 treatment showed significant increases in CD8+ T cells on days 3, 5, and 7 and in CD4+ T cells on days 5 and 7 and a decrease in macrophages and monocytes on days 3, 5, and 7 after treatment. Similar results were obtained in the CT26 model on day 11 posttreatment. Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to directly correlate early tumor infiltration of T cells with anti-CTLA4 treatment success, thus providing a mechanistic clue toward understanding why alloidentical mice challenged with identical tumors do not respond uniformly to ICI therapies.\n",
      "Disease progression following androgen ablation was shown to be associated with upregulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Longitudinal monitoring of GR expression in circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) may reflect changes in the tumor cell and facilitates detection of acquired resistance. We utilized LNCaP, LREX cells and a patient derived xenograft, MDA PDX 322-2-6a, for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Plasma derived EVs were isolated from patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer undergoing androgen ablation. The mRNA levels of GR in EVs and their responsive genes were detected by transcriptome analysis, RT-qPCR and the protein levels by western blot. We detected changes in GR expression at mRNA and protein levels in EVs derived from LNCaP and LREX cells in in vitro studies. In in vivo experiments, LNCaP and the PDX MDA 322-2-6a-bearing mice were treated with enzalutamide. GR levels in plasma derived EVs were increased only in those tumors that did not respond to enzalutamide. Treatment of mice bearing enzalutamide-resistant tumors with a GR inhibitor in combination with enzalutamide led to a transient pause in tumor growth in a subset of tumors and decreased GR levels intracellular and in plasma derived EVs. In a subgroup of high-risk localized prostate cancer patients treated with androgen signaling inhibition, GR was found upregulated in matching tissue and plasma EVs. These analyses showed that GR levels in plasma derived EVs may be used for monitoring the transition of GR expression allowing for early detection of resistance to androgen ablation treatment.\n",

Here, we report that O-GlcNAcylation is essential for hepatocyte differentiation, and chronic loss results in fibrosis and HCC.\n",
      "Single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to investigate hepatocyte differentiation in hepatocyte-specific O-GlcNAc transferase-knockout (OGT-KO) mice with decreased hepatic O-GlcNAcylation and in O-GlcNAcase-KO mice with increased O-GlcNAcylation in hepatocytes. Patients HCC samples and the diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC model were used to investigate the effect of modulation of O-GlcNAcylation on the development of liver cancer.\n",
      "Loss of hepatic O-GlcNAcylation resulted in disruption of liver zonation. Periportal hepatocytes were the most affected by loss of differentiation, characterized by dysregulation of glycogen storage and glucose production. O-GlcNAc transferase-KO mice exacerbated diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC development with increased inflammation, fibrosis, and YAP signaling. Consistently, O-GlcNAcase -KO mice with increased hepatic O-GlcNAcylation inhibited diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC. A progressive loss of O-GlcNAcylation was observed in patients with HCC.\n",
      "Our study shows that O-GlcNAcylation is a critical regulator of hepatic differentiation, and loss of O-GlcNAcylation promotes hepatocarcinogenesis. These data highlight increasing O-GlcNAcylation as a potential therapy in chronic liver diseases, including HCC.\n",
      "Obesity is a risk factor for multiple myeloma (MM). However, we still lack knowledge on the clinical course of obese MM patients in a broad view.\n",
      "Here, we reviewed 568 MM patients recorded in the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) coMMpass dataset. Patients were divided into the normal and obese groups according body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis, and then the baseline characteristics, cytogenetic abnormalities, treatment variability, and survival outcomes were evaluated in the obese cohort.\n",
      "We found no differences in the characteristics when comparing normal and obese MM patients other than more male in the obese part (50.4% vs. 59.9%, p = 0.024). Compared with the normal BMI patients, median overall survival (OS) was shorter for obese MM patients but without significant meaning (82.3 vs. 95.3 months, p = 0.25). However, in the subgroup analysis, obese MM patients younger than 65 years had significantly inferior OS than that in the normal category (p = 0.047). We also found obese MM patients had a higher overall response rate (ORR) compared with normal BMI patients (92.7% vs. 88.6%, p = 0.037). Additionally, obese patients seemed to achieve faster best response during first-line therapy.\n",

This systematic review aimed at deepening the understanding of sarcoma's impact on the entire family unit involved in the illness experience on a physical (e.g. fatigue), psychological (e.g. mental health, affective regulation, defense mechanisms), and interpersonal (e.g. social isolation, loneliness) level.\n",
      "The systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The literature search led to the identification and subsequent inclusion of 44 articles focused on sarcoma patients. Results were classified into seven categories: Quality of Life, worries and distress, anxiety and depression, suicide ideation, financial and occupational consequences, unmet needs, and coping strategies. Our search identified only one study focusing on informal caregivers, thus we could not perform a systematic review on these results.\n",
      "Our findings underlined the traumatic impact of the sarcoma diagnosis. Patients can experience an impoverished emotional life, somatization, social withdrawal, difficulty in decision-making, increased feelings of discouragement and demoralization, and profound experiences of helplessness and vulnerability. Moreover, they seemed to display anxiety and depression and might present a higher suicide incidence than the general population.\n",
      "Our review highlighted that the psychosocial aftermath of sarcoma patients should guide institutions and healthcare professionals toward the design of assessment and intervention models that could contemplate the different dimensions of their suffering. Furthermore, it points out that there is still a lack of evidence regarding the psychosocial impact affecting sarcoma patients' caregivers.\n",
      "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with 20-22 nucleotides, which are encoded by endogenous genes and are capable of targeting the majority of human mRNAs. Arsenic is regarded as a human carcinogen, which can lead to many adverse health effects including diabetes, skin lesions, kidney disease, neurological impairment, male reproductive injury, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart failure, and endothelial dysfunction. miRNAs can act as tumor suppressors and oncogenes via directly targeting oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Recently, miRNA dysregulation was considered to be an important mechanism of arsenic-induced human diseases and a potential biomarker to predict the diseases caused by arsenic exposure. Endogenic miRNAs such as miR-21, the miR-200 family, miR-155, and the let-7 family are involved in arsenic-induced human disease by inducing translational repression or RNA degradation and influencing multiple pathways, including mTOR/Arg 1, HIF-1α/VEGF, AKT, c-Myc, MAPK, Wnt, and PI3K pathways. Additionally, exogenous miRNAs derived from plants, such as miR-34a, miR-159, miR-2911, miR-159a, miR-156c, miR-168, etc., among others, can be transported from blood to specific tissue/organ systems in vivo. These exogenous miRNAs might be critical players in the treatment of human diseases by regulating host gene expression. This review summarizes the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in arsenic-induced human diseases, including cancers, CVD, and other human diseases. These special miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers in the management and treatment of human diseases linked to arsenic exposure. Finally, the protective action of exogenous miRNAs, including antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-CVD, antioxidant stress, and antivirus are described.\n",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to characterize the associations between cSVD and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), cerebral autoregulation (CA), and arterial stiffness (AS). Methods and Results MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched from inception to September 2023 for studies reporting CVR, CA, or AS in relation to radiological markers of cSVD. Data were extracted in predefined tables, reviewed, and meta-analyses performed using inverse-variance random effects models to determine pooled odds ratios (OR). A total of 1611 studies were identified; 142 were included in the systematic review, of which 60 had data available for meta-analyses. Systematic review revealed that CVR, CA, and AS were consistently associated with cSVD (80.4%, 78.6%, and 85.4% of studies, respectively). Meta-analysis in 7 studies (536 participants, 32.9% women) revealed a borderline association between impaired CVR and cSVD (OR:2.26, 95%CI:0.99-5.14; P=0.05).

      "Burns are among the most common causes of trauma worldwide. Reducing the healing time of deep burn wounds has always been a major challenge. Traditional dressings not only require a lengthy medical procedure but also cause unbearable pain and secondary damage to patients. In this study, we developed an exudate-absorbing and antimicrobial hydrogel with a curcumin-loaded magnesium polyphenol network (Cur-Mg@PP) to promote burn wound healing. That hydrogel was composed of an ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PLL)/polymer poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) hydrogel (PP) and curcumin-loaded magnesium polyphenol network (Cur-Mg). Because of the strong water absorption property of ε-PLL and γ-PGA, Cur-Mg@PP powder can quickly absorb the wound exudate and transform into a moist and viscous hydrogel, thus releasing payloads such as magnesium ion (Mg\n",

      "As of September 2022, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched to include English studies assessing diverse factors influencing vaccination uptake in European women. Only studies comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated women were included. Quality assessment, publication attrition assessment, and sensitivity analyses were performed.\n",
      "Eighteen studies were included, totaling a population of 18,611 participants. Results indicated that knowledge about HPV infection could positively influence vaccination rates with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.82 and a confidence interval (CI) between 1.27 and 2.61, showing statistical significance at a Z value of 3.24 with a p-value of 0.001. Neither knowledge about HPV vaccination (OR = 1.39, CI: 0.73-2.65, Z = 1.01, p = 0.31) nor knowledge about CC screening (OR = 1.05, CI: 0.55-1.98, Z = 0,14, p = 0.89) seem to affect vaccination rates. Regardless, intention to undertake CC screening (CCS) showed an OR = 1.68 in favor of the group intending to perform it, with a CI between 1.37 and 2.07, showing statistical significance at a Z = 4.94 and p = 0.00001.

      "The expected radon concentration at the Schneeberg mines has been estimated using published data. Modeling of the accumulation of radon in the working tunnels of mine workings was carried out using the RESRAD-Build 4.0, based on the radium concentration in soil and geometric parameters of the mining tunnel from the engravings in Agricola's book. The dynamics of radionuclides in the human body were performed using the WinAct software in accordance with data from ICRP Publications 130 and 137. The values of absorbed doses on the tissues of the respiratory tract were obtained using the IDAC 2.1 program. Several models based on the epidemiology of uranium miners have been used to calculate radiation risks from radon exposure. The probability of male survival at birth and the age-specific frequency of spontaneous lung cancer not associated with radiation for miners of the sixteenth century (nonsmoking men aged 20-40 years) were estimated to properly calculate the radiation risks.\n",

      "A total of 144 patients with diverse cancer types and a control group comprising 158 healthy adults with similar demographic characteristics completed the Valued Living Questionnaire-Perceived Change, the Personal Meaning Profile-Brief, the Portrait Values Questionnaire, and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being.\n",
      "Cancer patients displayed a substantial values reappraisal compared to healthy adults. They reported an increased significance of social areas and self-transcendental values, including close relationships (family, partner, and friends), spirituality, citizenship, and universalism, as well as an increased importance of self-care and self in general. Conversely, cancer patients assigned less importance to work and self-enhancement values such as stimulation, power, and achievement. Cluster analysis revealed that patients who reappraised their values exhibited higher meaningfulness and better indicators of quality of life, including spiritual and physical well-being, compared to patients who did not modify their value system.\n",

The changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second were calculated pre- and postoperatively, and a cutoff value of - 10%, the previously reported reduction rete after lobectomy, was used to divide the patients into two groups: the severely-reduced group ( ≤ -10%) and normal group ( > -10%). These groups were compared to identify predictors for severe reduction.\n",
      "Thirty-seven (16%) patients experienced severe reduction. Lesions with a total tumour size ≥ 1 cm were significantly more frequent in the severely-reduced group than in the normal group (89.2% vs 71.5%; P = 0.024). A total tumour size ≥ 1 cm [odds ratio (OR), 3.287; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.114-9.699: P = 0.031] and pleural indentation (OR, 2.474; 95% CI, 1.039-5.890: P = 0.041) were significant predictive factors in the univariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, pleural indentation (OR, 2.667; 95% CI, 1.082-6.574; P = 0.033) was an independent predictive factor, whereas smoking status, and total tumour size were marginally significant.\n",

      "Pediatric brain tumor survivors demonstrate weaknesses in adaptive functioning, most notably practical adaptive skills; however, the specific areas of weakness within practical skills are unknown. This study examined the aspects of practical adaptive functions that are most impacted in brain tumor survivors, and identified medical and socio-demographic variables that predicted outcomes. The sample included 117 pediatric brain tumor patients seen for a clinical neuropsychological evaluation and whose parents completed the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second or Third Edition. T-tests compared practical adaptive skills to normative means. Correlations examined associations between medical and socio-demographic variables and each of the practical adaptive subscales (Community Use, Home Living, Health & Safety, Self-Care). Significant correlations were entered into linear regression models for each practical adaptive skill. All practical subscales were significantly below the normative mean. Community Use was positively correlated with age at diagnosis and negatively correlated with treatment burden, time since diagnosis, and neighborhood deprivation. Health and Safety was positively correlated with age at diagnosis. Home Living was positively correlated with neighborhood deprivation. Self-Care was positively correlated with age at diagnosis and parental education. Specific medical and socio-demographic factors predicted practical adaptive functioning, highlighting the importance of considering the role of medical and socio-demographic determinants of health on adaptive functioning outcomes in pediatric brain tumors.\n",

      "In this study, laryngeal cancer alone and LCSMLC were defined using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Risk factors of patients with LCSMLC were analyzed through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Independent prognostic factors were selected by Cox regression analyses, on the basis of which a nomogram was constructed using R code. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were applied to test the application of a risk stratification system. Finally, we conducted a comparison of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system of laryngeal cancer with the new model of nomogram and risk stratification. For further validation of the nomogram, data from patients at two Chinese independent institutions were also analyzed.\n",
      "According to the eligibility criteria, 32 429 patients with laryngeal cancer alone and 641 patients with LCSMLC from the SEER database (the training cohort) and additional 61 patients from two Chinese independent institutions (the external validation cohort) were included for final analyses. Compared with patients with laryngeal cancer who did not have synchronous or metachronous lung cancer, age, sex, race, primary site of laryngeal cancer, grade, and stage were risk factors for LCSMLC, while marriage, surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are not their risk factors. Age, two cancers' interval, pathological type, stage, surgery, radiation, primary lung site, and primary throat site were independent prognostic predictors of LCSMLC. The risk stratification system of high-, medium-, and low-risk groups significantly distinguished the prognosis in different patients with LCSMLC, regardless of the training cohort or the validation cohort. Compared with the 6th AJCC TNM stage of laryngeal cancer, the new model of nomogram and risk stratification showed an improved net benefit.\n",

      "Reconstructing the full-length sequence of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) from short sequencing reads has proved challenging given the similarity of eccDNAs and their corresponding linear DNAs. Previous sequencing methods were unable to achieve high-throughput detection of full-length eccDNAs. Herein, a novel algorithm was developed, called Full-Length eccDNA Detection (FLED), to reconstruct the sequence of eccDNAs based on the strategy that combined rolling circle amplification and nanopore long-reads sequencing technology. Seven human epithelial and cancer cell line samples were analyzed by FLED and over 5000 full-length eccDNAs were identified per sample. The structures of identified eccDNAs were validated by both Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Compared to other published nanopore-based eccDNA detectors, FLED exhibited higher sensitivity. In cancer cell lines, the genes overlapped with eccDNA regions were enriched in cancer-related pathways and cis-regulatory elements can be predicted in the upstream or downstream of intact genes on eccDNA molecules, and the expressions of these cancer-related genes were dysregulated in tumor cell lines, indicating the regulatory potency of eccDNAs in biological processes. The proposed method takes advantage of nanopore long reads and enables unbiased reconstruction of full-length eccDNA sequences. FLED is implemented using Python3 which is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/FuyuLi/FLED).\n",

      "Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment, leading to poor clinical outcomes. Dysregulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters has been identified as a key contributor to MDR. Zinc finger proteins (ZNPs) are key regulators of transcription and have emerged as potential contributors to cancer drug resistance. Bridging the knowledge gap between ZNPs and MDR is essential to understand a source of heterogeneity in cancer treatment. This review sought to elucidate how different ZNPs modulate the transcriptional regulation of ABC genes, contributing to resistance to cancer therapies.\n",

Among the ZNP-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition, SNAIL, SLUG and Zebs have been identified as important factors in promoting MDR through activation of ATM, NFκB and PI3K/Akt pathways, exposing the metabolism to potential ZNP-MDR interactions. Additionally, nuclear receptors, such as VDR, ER and PXR have been found to modulate certain ABC regulations. Other C2H2-type zinc fingers, including Kruppel-like factors, Gli and Sp also have the potential to contribute to MDR.\n",

      "Diagnosing lung cancer using a flexible bronchoscope is a safe procedure with a very low risk of complications. Bronchoscopy has high diagnostic accuracy for endobronchial lesions, but it falls short when sampling peripheral lesions. Therefore, several modalities have been invented to guide the bronchoscope to the lesion and confirm the location of the tumor before tissue sampling. Fluoroscopy is used during bronchoscopy to provide a 2D X-ray image of the thorax during the procedure. The bronchoscope and tools will be visible, as well as lesions if larger than 2.0-2.5 cm. Radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS) consists of an ultrasound probe, small enough to be inserted into the working channel of the bronchoscope. The ultrasound probe is used to differentiate between consolidated tissue, such as tumor tissue, and normal air-filled lung parenchyma. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) creates a 3D model of the bronchial tree from computed tomography (CT) scans of the patient. Prior to the bronchoscopy, a route from the trachea to the lesion is planned, to create real-time guidance of the bronchoscope to the lesion during the procedure, similar to the Global Positioning System. The aim of this article is to describe a stepwise approach to performing bronchoscopy with rEBUS and fluoroscopy, bronchoscopy with ENB, rEBUS, and fluoroscopy. In the discussion section, the pros and cons of each modality will be discussed.\n",

      "Sialic acids are negatively charged monosaccharides typically found at the termini of cell surface glycans. Due to their hydrophilicity and biophysical characteristics, they are involved in numerous biological processes, such as modulation of the immune response, recognition of self and non-self antigens, carbohydrate-protein interactions, etc. The cellular content of sialic acid is regulated by sialidase, which catalyzes the removal of sialic acid residues. Several studies have shown that sialo-glycans are critical in monitoring immune surveillance by engaging with cis and trans inhibitory Siglec receptors on immune cells. Likewise, glyco-immune checkpoints in cancer are becoming crucial targets for developing immunotherapies. Additionally, dendritic cells (DCs) are envisioned as an important component in immunotherapies, especially in cancer research, due to their unique role as professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) and their capacity to trigger adaptive immune responses and generate immunologic memory. Nevertheless, the function of DCs is dependent on their full maturation. Immature DCs have an opposing function to mature DCs and a high sialic acid content, which further dampens their maturation level. This downregulates the ability of immature DCs to activate T-cells, leading to a compromised immune response. Consequently, removing sialic acid from the cell surface of human DCs induces their maturation, thus increasing the expression of MHC molecules and antigen presentation. In addition, it can restore the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and IL-12, resulting in DCs having a higher ability to polarize T-cells toward a Th1 phenotype and specifically activate cytotoxic T-cells to kill tumor cells. Therefore, sialic acid has emerged as a key modulator of DCs and is being used as a novel target to advance their therapeutic use. This study provides a unique approach to treat in vitro monocyte-derived DCs with sialidase, aimed at generating DC populations with different cell surface sialic acid phenotypes and tailored maturation and co-stimulatory profiles.\n",

      "Cancer remains a significant global health challenge with limited treatment options beyond systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecular targeted therapy. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality but the efficacy has plateaued, which therefore provides limited benefits to patients with cancer. Identification of more effective approaches to improve patient outcomes and extend survival are urgently needed. Drug repurposing has emerged as an attractive strategy for drug development and has recently garnered considerable interest. This review comprehensively analyses the efficacy of various repurposed drugs, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) inhibitors, metformin, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) inhibitors, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), thymosin α1 (Tα1), aspirin, and bisphosphonate, in tumorigenesis with a specific focus on their impact on tumor immunology and immunotherapy. Additionally, we present a concise overview of the current preclinical and clinical studies investigating the potential therapeutic synergies achieved by combining these agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n",
      "Breast cancer is the most prevalent tumor in women, ranking first in incidence and mortality in many countries. Although the causes of breast cancer are complex and multifactorial, nutritional factors and those related to nutritional status play an important role in the development of the disease. In this way, factors that increase breast cancer risk have been identified, such as weight gain, the amount of adipose tissue, waist circumference, alcohol consumption or the consumption of red meat and processed meat, while other factors have been identified that reduce the risk, such as eating fruits and vegetables. Nutritional factors or factors that depend on the state of nutrition are modifiable and preventable, so they must be considered when designing effective prevention programs.\n",

      "The Royal National Institute of Blind people report that over 2 million people in the United Kingdom are living with sight loss. This number is predicted to double to nearly 4 million by 2050. Conditions that lead to sight loss and impaired vision can be treated if eye tissue is available through, for example corneal transplantation, reconstructive surgery and research into eye diseases. However, the problem is that there is not enough eye tissue available to meet current need. Patients under the care of hospice care services and hospital palliative care services who, due to a cancer diagnosis, are unable to donate other organs or tissues, may be able to donate their eyes. To explore potential for eye donation in these settings, we looked at the clinical notes from patients who died in the previous 2 years to see if they could potentially have been a donor. We also interviewed patients and carers seeking their views regarding ‘if’, ‘when’ and ‘how’ a conversation about eye donation should take place within end-of-life care planning. We also asked healthcare professionals (via interviews and a national survey) about their views regarding eye donation being part of end-of-life planning, and what they saw as the key barriers to this becoming a routine practice. We found that many patients are eligible for eye donation, but very few are asked about this option, and that patients indicated they wanted this option raised with them so that they could make decisions about donation. A review of patient notes, healthcare professional interviews and survey responses indicate that eye donation is not part of the current routine clinical practice. Our work presents a clear case for a change to current practice so that patients who wish to donate are offered this opportunity as a part of routine end-of-life care, and that changes in the current practice require specific training initiatives and institutional support.\n",

Univariate and multivariate analysis of perioperative outcomes utilized the Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-squared test, Mantel-Haenszel test of trend, and multiple linear regression. Radical nephrectomies were classified in cT1, cT2a, and cT2b-T3 subgroups and compared to simple nephrectomies. Minimally invasive and open techniques were compared between the two groups. Infected versus non-infected simple nephrectomies were compared.\n",
      "A total of 344 radical and 129 simple nephrectomies were included. Simple nephrectomy was an independent predictor of increased operative time (p = 0.001), length of stay (p = 0.049), and postoperative complications (p < 0.001). Simple nephrectomies had higher operative time (p < 0.001), length of stay (p = 0.014), and postoperative morbidity (p < 0.001) than cT1 radical nephrectomies and significantly more Clavien 1-2 complications than cT2a radical nephrectomies (p = 0.001).

      "To understand the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on lung cancer progression and developing biomarkers, we here used an inducible mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancer transgenic mouse model fed with a regular diet (RD) or high-fat diet (HFD). The results displayed the HFD lung cancer group (LC-HFD group) exhibited significant tumor formation and deterioration, such as higher EGFR activity and proliferation marker expression, compared with the RD lung cancer group (LC-RD group). The transcriptomic analysis of the lung tissues revealed that the significantly changed genes in the LC-HFD group were highly enriched in immune-related signaling pathways, suggesting that HFD alters the immune microenvironment for promoting tumor growth. Following cytokines and adipokines arrays combined with a comprehensive analysis using meta-database software, C-reactive protein (CRP) emerged as the most likely potential candidate within the LC-HFD group, presenting enhanced lung cancer proliferation and metastasis; this was confirmed experimentally. Our results imply that HFD could turn the tumor growth environment into an immune-related pro-tumorigenic microenvironment and demonstrate that CRP has a role in promoting lung cancer development in this microenvironment.\n",
      "Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell and play important roles in multiple cellular processes including cell metabolism, proliferation, and programmed cell death. Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles with the inner membrane folding inward to form cristae. Mitochondria networks undergo dynamic fission and fusion. Deregulation of mitochondrial structure has been linked to perturbed mitochondrial membrane potential and disrupted metabolism, as evidenced in tumorigenesis, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. Actin and its motors-myosins have long been known to generate mechanical forces and participate in short-distance cargo transport. Accumulating knowledge from biochemistry and live cell/electron microscope imaging has demonstrated the role of actin filaments in pre-constricting the mitochondria during fission. Recent studies have suggested the involvement of myosins in cristae maintenance and mitochondria quality control. Here, we review current findings and discuss future directions in the emerging fields of cytoskeletal regulation in cristae formation, mitochondrial dynamics, intracellular transport, and mitocytosis, with focus on the actin cytoskeleton and its motor proteins.\n",

      "SLN surgery was successful in 65/73 (89%), identifying a median of 2 (range 1-4) SLNs, with 10/65 (15%) SLN-positive. Among these, 5/10 (50%) proceeded to ALND. In unsuccessful cases, 1/8 (13%) proceeded to ALND. Seven of 10 SLN-positive patients and 50/55 SLN-negative patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemotherapy was administered in 31 (42%) and endocrine therapy in 50 of 57 HR+ patients (88%). After 28 months median follow-up, eight patients relapsed with the first site local in two, distant in five, and synchronous local/distant in one. No nodal recurrences were observed.\n",

      "Only 17.3% of CIT cycles (n = 416) screened patients for pregnancy 90 days or prior to administration, and the median time between pregnancy screening and treatment was approximately three weeks. One patient with early breast cancer had a spontaneous miscarriage estimated at 3-4 weeks gestation, and neither the patient nor the treating oncologist was aware of this event. This was also the only patient who had a pregnancy test beyond the first cycle of CIT during their treatment.\n",

      "Sterols, including β-sitosterol, are essential components of cellular membranes in both plant and animal cells. Despite being a major phytosterol in various plant materials, comprehensive scientific knowledge regarding the properties of β-sitosterol and its potential applications is essential for scholarly pursuits and utilization purposes. β-sitosterol shares similar chemical characteristics with cholesterol and exhibits several pharmacological activities without major toxicity. This study aims to bridge the gap between phytochemistry and current pharmacological evidence of β-sitosterol, focusing on its anticancer activity and other biomedical properties. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of β-sitosterol's potential for future translational approaches. A thorough examination of the literature was conducted to gather relevant information on the biological properties of β-sitosterol, particularly its anticancer therapeutic potential. Various databases were searched, including PubMed/MedLine, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using appropriate keywords. Studies investigating the effects of β-sitosterol on different types of cancer were analyzed, focusing on mechanisms of action, pharmacological screening, and chemosensitizing properties. Modern pharmacological screening studies have revealed the potential anticancer therapeutic properties of β-sitosterol against various types of cancer, including leukemia, lung, stomach, breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancer. β-sitosterol has demonstrated chemosensitizing effects on cancer cells, interfering with multiple cell signaling pathways involved in proliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, survival, metastasis invasion, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Structural derivatives of β-sitosterol have also shown anti-cancer effects. However, research in the field of drug delivery and the detailed mode of action of β-sitosterol-mediated anticancer activities remains limited. β-sitosterol, as a non-toxic compound with significant pharmacological potential, exhibits promising anticancer effects against various cancer types. Despite being relatively less potent than conventional cancer chemotherapeutics, β-sitosterol holds potential as a safe and effective nutraceutical against cancer. Further comprehensive studies are recommended to explore the biological properties of β-sitosterol, including its mode of action, and develop novel formulations for its potential use in cancer treatment. This review provides a foundation for future investigations and highlights the need for further research on β-sitosterol as a potent superfood in combating cancer.\n",

Many research studies have suggested that consuming foods high in polyphenols, which are present in large amounts in grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits, may delay the onset of various illnesses, including cancer. Normal cells with genetic abnormalities begin the meticulously organized path leading to cancer, which causes the cells to constantly multiply, colonize, and metastasize to other organs like the liver, lungs, colon, and brain. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring stilbene and non-flavonoid polyphenol, a phytoestrogen with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and anticancer properties. Resveratrol makes cancer cells more susceptible to common chemotherapeutic treatments by reversing multidrug resistance in cancer cells. This is especially true when combined with clinically used medications. Several new resveratrol analogs with enhanced anticancer effectiveness, absorption, and pharmacokinetic profile have been discovered. The present emphasis of this review is the modulation of intracellular molecular targets by resveratrol in vivo and in vitro in various malignancies.

      "Cancer and other diseases can be treated with cubosomes, which are lyotropic nonlamellar liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LCNs). These cubosomes can potentially be a highly versatile carrier with theranostic efficacy, as they can be ingested, applied topically, or injected intravenously. Recent years have seen substantial progress in the synthesis, characterization, regulation of drug release patterns, and target selectivity of loaded anticancer bioactive compounds. However, its use in clinical settings has been slow and necessitates additional proof. Recent progress and roadblocks in using cubosomes as a nanotechnological intervention against various cancers are highlighted. In the last few decades, advances in biomedical nanotechnology have allowed for the development of \"smart\" drug delivery devices that can adapt to external stimuli. By improving therapeutic targeting efficacy and lowering the negative effects of payloads, these well-defined nanoplatforms can potentially promote patient compliance in response to specific stimuli. Liposomes and niosomes, two other well-known vesicular systems, share a lipid basis with cubosomes. Possible applications include a novel medication delivery system for hydrophilic, lipophilic, and amphiphilic drugs. We evaluate the literature on cubosomes, emphasizing their potential use in tumor-targeted drug delivery applications and critiquing existing explanations for cubosome self-assembly, composition, and production. As cubosome dispersion has bioadhesive and compatible features, numerous drug delivery applications, including oral, ocular, and transdermal, are also discussed in this review.\n",
      "In recent years, the number of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis has been increasing, and traditional Chinese medicine ingredients and combinations have been applied to treat Hashimoto's thyroiditis to increase efficacy and reduce side effects during the treatment process.\n",
      "Shutiao Qiji Decoction is one of the Chinese traditional medicine prescriptions, which is commonly used to treat cancer, tumor, etc. It is also used for thyroid-related diseases in the clinic. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease. In this study, the mechanism of Shutiao Qiji Decoction in treating Hashimoto's thyroiditis was studied through network pharmacology and molecular docking verification.\n",
      "Each Chinese medicine ingredient of Shutiao Qiji Decoction was retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. The related genes of HT were searched from the UniProt and GeneCards databases. Meanwhile, we used Cytoscape to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) visual network analysis, and used the search tool to search the database of Interacting Genes (STRING) to build a PPI network. These key proteins were enriched and analyzed by molecular docking validation, Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Hashimoto's thyroiditis disease model was established in SD rats, and SQD was administered by gavage after the successful establishment of the model. After 6 weeks of continuous administration of the drug by gavage, tissue samples were collected and the thyroid and spleen tissues were visualized by HE staining to verify the therapeutic effect.\n",
      "The results showed that there were 287 TCM active ingredients, 1920 HT-related disease targets, and 176 drug and disease targets in SQD. Through PPI analysis, GP analysis, and KEGG analysis of the common targets of drugs and diseases, we found their pathways of action to be mainly cancer action pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and T-cell action pathway. The active ingredients of the drugs in SQD, malvidin, stigmasterol, porin-5-en-3bta-ol, and chrysanthemum stigmasterol, were docked with the related target proteins, MAPK, GSK3β, TSHR, and NOTCH molecules. The best binding energies obtained from docking were mairin with TSHR, stigmasterol with TSHR, poriferast-5-en-3beta-ol with MAPK, and chryseriol with GSK3β, with binding energies of -6.84 kcal/mol, -6.53 kcal/mol, -5.03 kcal/mol, and -5.05 kcal/mol, respectively. HE staining sections of rat thyroid and spleen tissues showed that SQD had a therapeutic effect on Hashimoto's thyroiditis and restored its immune function.\n",

SQD has been shown to have a good therapeutic effect on Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n",
      "The current study recognizes the significance of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) as a member of the nuclear receptor protein family, which holds a central role in the pathophysiology of breast cancer. ERα serves as a valuable prognostic marker, with its established relevance in predicting disease outcomes and treatment responses.\n",
      "In this study, computational methods are utilized to search for suitable drug-like compounds that demonstrate analogous ligand binding kinetics to ERα.\n",
      "Docking-based simulation screened out the top 5 compounds - ZINC13377936, NCI35753, ZINC35465238, ZINC14726791, and NCI663569 against the targeted protein. Further, their dynamics studies reveal that the compounds ZINC13377936 and NCI35753 exhibit the highest binding stability and affinity.\n",
      "Anticipating the competitive inhibition of ERα protein expression in breast cancer, we envision that both ZINC13377936 and NCI35753 compounds hold substantial promise as potential therapeutic agents. These candidates warrant thorough consideration for rigorous In vitro and In vivo evaluations within the context of clinical trials. The findings from this current investigation carry significant implications for the advancement of future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for breast cancer.\n",

      "Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is a protein that in breast cancer increases with disease progression. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from breast cancer cells with CAV1 also contain Tenascin C (TNC) protein, but the importance of TNC remained to be defined. EVs were identified by size, microscopy and protein analysis. The effects of EVs on breast cancer cells were studied using cells and experiments in animals. CAV1 expression promotes TNC inclusion into EVs, which increased the aggressiveness of recipient breast cancer cells. In animals, only EVs with TNC increased features associated with cancer spread, while EVs lacking TNC reduced tumor growth.\n",
      "Recently, prognosis and survival of cancer patients has improved due to progression and refinement of cancer therapies; however, cardiovascular sequelae in this population augmented and now represent the second cause of death in oncological patients. Initially, the main issue was represented by heart failure and coronary artery disease, but a growing body of evidence has now shed light on the increased arrhythmic risk of this population, atrial fibrillation being the most frequently encountered. Awareness of arrhythmic complications of cancer and its treatments may help oncologists and cardiologists to develop targeted approaches for the management of arrhythmias in this population. In this review, we provide an updated overview of the mechanisms triggering cardiac arrhythmias in cancer patients, their prevalence and management.\n",
      "Near-infrared II fluorescent probes targeting tumors for diagnostic purposes have received much attention in recent years. In this study, a fluorescent probe for the NIR-II was constructed by using IRDye800CW-NHS fluorescent dye with Trastuzumab, which was investigated for its ability to target HER-2-positive breast cancer in xenograft mice models. This probe was compared with Trastuzumab-ICG which was synthesized using a similar structure, ICG-NHS. The results demonstrated that the IRDye800CW-NHS had significantly stronger fluorescence in the NIR-I and NIR-II than ICG-NHS in the aqueous phase. And the different metabolic modes of IRDye800CW-NHS and ICG-NHS were revealed in bioimaging experiments. IRDye800CW-NHS was mainly metabolised by the kidneys, while ICG-NHS was mainly metabolised by the liver. After coupling with Trastuzumab, Trastuzumab-800CW (TMR = 5.35 ± 0.39) not only had a stronger tumor targeting ability than Trastuzumab-ICG (TMR = 4.42 ± 0.10) based on the calculated maximum tumor muscle ratio (TMR), but also had a comparatively lower hepatic uptake and faster metabolism. Histopathology analysis proved that both fluorescent probes were non-toxic to various organ tissues. These results reveal the excellent optical properties of IRDye800CW-NHS, and the great potential of coupling with antibodies to develop fluorescent probes that will hopefully be applied to intraoperative breast cancer navigation in humans.\n",
      "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of cancers. However, the role and mechanism of the pseudogene lncRNA PIN1P1 in gastric carcinoma remain unclear. The expression and effects of lncRNA PIN1P1 in gastric cancer were investigated. The transcriptional regulation of CREB1 on PIN1P1 was determined by ChIP and luciferase assays. The mechanistic model of PIN1P1 in gastric cancer was further explored by RNA pull-down, RIP and western blot analysis. PIN1P1 was overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues, and upregulated PIN1P1 predicted poor prognosis in patients. CREB1 was directly combined with the promoter region of PIN1P1 to promote the transcription of PIN1P1. CREB1-mediated enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion could be partially reversed by downregulation of PIN1P1. Overexpressed PIN1P1 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, whereas decreased PIN1P1 showed the opposite effects. PIN1P1 directly interacted with YBX1 and promoted YBX1 protein expression, leading to upregulation of PIN1, in which E2F1 may be involved. Silencing of YBX1 during PIN1P1 overexpression could partially rescue PIN1 upregulation. PIN1, the parental gene of PIN1P1, was elevated in gastric cancer tissues, and its upregulation was correlated with poor patient outcomes. PIN1 facilitated gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. To sum up, CREB1-activated PIN1P1 could promote gastric cancer progression through YBX1 and upregulating PIN1, suggesting that it is a potential target for gastric cancer.\n",
      "Hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare, highly aggressive malignancy of the liver. The tumorigenesis of hepatic angiosarcoma has been relatively understudied in terms of aetiology and molecular properties. A recent study published in The Journal of Pathology revealed a strong association between hepatic angiosarcoma incidence and chronic kidney disease, particularly in end-stage renal disease using population-based data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan and an institutional cohort. The study also revealed enrichment in the mutational signature of aristolochic acid exposure and is the first reported observation of this mutational signature in human sarcomas. © 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n",
      "Prior studies have emphasized the role of inflammation in the response to injury and muscle regeneration, but little emphasis has been placed on characterizing the relationship between innate inflammation, pain, and functional impairment. The aim of our study was to determine the contribution of innate immunity to prolonged pain following muscle contusion.\n",
      "We developed a closed-impact mouse model of muscle contusion and a macrophage-targeted near-infrared fluorescent nanoemulsion. Closed-impact contusions were delivered to the lower left limb. Pain sensitivity, gait dysfunction, and inflammation were assessed in the days and weeks post-contusion. Macrophage accumulation was imaged in vivo by injecting i.v. near-infrared nanoemulsion.\n",
      "Despite hindpaw hypersensitivity persisting for several weeks, disruptions to gait and grip strength typically resolved within 10 days of injury. Using non-invasive imaging and immunohistochemistry, we show that macrophage density peaks in and around the affected muscle 3 day post-injury and quickly subsides. However, macrophage density in the ipsilateral sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) increases more gradually and persists for at least 14 days.\n",
      "In this study, we demonstrate pain sensitivity is influenced by the degree of lower muscle contusion, without significant changes to gait and grip strength. This may be due to modulation of pain signaling by macrophage proliferation in the sciatic nerve, upstream from the site of injury. Our work suggests chronic pain developing from muscle contusion is driven by macrophage-derived neuroinflammation in the peripheral nervous system.\n",
      "Breast adipose tissue is an important contributor to the obesity-breast cancer link. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized particles containing selective cargo, such as miRNAs, that act locally or circulate to distant sites to modulate target cell functions. Here, we find that long-term education of breast cancer cells with EVs obtained from breast adipose tissue of women who are overweight or obese (O-EVs) results in increased proliferation. RNA-seq analysis of O-EV-educated cells demonstrates increased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, such as ATP synthase and NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase. O-EVs increase respiratory complex protein expression, mitochondrial density, and mitochondrial respiration in tumor cells. The mitochondrial complex I inhibitor metformin reverses O-EV-induced cell proliferation. Several miRNAs-miR-155-5p, miR-10a-3p, and miR-30a-3p-which promote mitochondrial respiration and proliferation, are enriched in O-EVs relative to EVs from lean women. O-EV-induced proliferation and mitochondrial activity are associated with stimulation of the Akt/mTOR/P70S6K pathway, and are reversed upon silencing of P70S6K. This study reveals a new facet of the obesity-breast cancer link with human breast adipose tissue-derived EVs causing metabolic reprogramming of breast cancer cells.\n",
      "The metabolic demands of neuronal activity are both temporally and spatially dynamic, and neurons are particularly sensitive to disruptions in fuel and oxygen supply. Glucose is considered an obligate fuel for supporting brain metabolism. Although alternative fuels are often available, the extent of their contribution to central carbon metabolism remains debated. Differential fuel metabolism likely depends on cell type, location, and activity state, complicating its study. While biosensors provide excellent spatial and temporal information, they are limited to observations of only a few metabolites. On the other hand, mass spectrometry is rich in chemical information, but traditionally relies on cell culture or homogenized tissue samples. Here, we use mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to focus on the fuel metabolism of the dentate granule cell (DGC) layer in murine hippocampal slices. Using stable isotopes, we explore labeling dynamics at baseline, as well as in response to brief stimulation or fuel competition. We find that at rest, glucose is the predominant fuel metabolized through glycolysis, with little to no measurable contribution from glycerol or fructose. However, lactate/pyruvate, β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), octanoate, and glutamine can contribute to TCA metabolism to varying degrees. In response to brief depolarization with 50 mM KCl, glucose metabolism was preferentially increased relative to the metabolism of alternative fuels. With an increased supply of alternative fuels, both lactate/pyruvate and βHB can outcompete glucose for TCA cycle entry. While lactate/pyruvate modestly reduced glucose contribution to glycolysis, βHB caused little change in glycolysis. This approach achieves broad metabolite coverage from a spatially defined region of physiological tissue, in which metabolic states are rapidly preserved following experimental manipulation. Using this powerful methodology, we investigated metabolism within the dentate gyrus not only at rest, but also in response to the energetic demand of activation, and in states of fuel competition.\n",
      "Crosstalk between cancer and stellate cells is pivotal in pancreatic cancer, resulting in differentiation of stellate cells into myofibroblasts that drives tumour progression. To assess cooperative mechanisms in a 3D context, we generated chimeric spheroids using human and mouse cancer and stellate cells. Species-specific deconvolution of bulk-RNA sequencing data revealed cell type-specific transcriptomes underpinning invasion. This dataset highlighted stellate-specific expression of transcripts encoding the collagen-processing enzymes ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14. Strikingly, loss of ADAMTS2 reduced, while loss of ADAMTS14 promoted, myofibroblast differentiation and invasion independently of their primary role in collagen-processing. Functional and proteomic analysis demonstrated that these two enzymes regulate myofibroblast differentiation through opposing roles in the regulation of transforming growth factor β availability, acting on the protease-specific substrates, Serpin E2 and fibulin 2, for ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14, respectively. Showcasing a broader complexity for these enzymes, we uncovered a novel regulatory axis governing malignant behaviour of the pancreatic cancer stroma. © 2023 The Authors.

      "Store-and-forward teledermatology (SAFT) has become increasingly popular as a means to increase access to specialist care and address healthcare disparities such as those experienced by rural communities. A contemporary systematic overview of the Australian SAFT services and outcomes for all dermatological conditions is missing. This scoping review provides an overview of Australian SAFT models. Twelve studies were identified through web databases, grey literature sites and reference lists of eligible articles. Eligibility criteria included studies evaluating doctor-to-dermatologist Australian SAFT services provided to Australians for all skin conditions but excluded the studies that solely focused on skin cancers. Data on study design, setting, population, SAFT model, referral characteristics, patient, and general practitioner perspectives, diagnostic concordance, and measured outcomes such as follow up, investigation and waiting time were extracted. Quality of the included studies was assessed using CASP tools. Synthesis reveals that SAFT can be used for patients with any dermatological condition, provides more accurate diagnostics compared to cases without dermatologist input, may reduce waiting times for dermatological expertise, and users generally had positive experiences with SAFT. Although results are positive, this review reveals the heterogenous nature of the literature on SAFT in Australia and a need to establish a uniform approach to assessing the outcomes and impacts of such services.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rapid changes to head and neck cancer (HNC) services.

      "A total of 23 participant surveys were returned. Six categories were identified: Usability; Information receiving & giving; Satisfaction; Emotions and comfort; Rapport; and Travel time and cost. Overall, participants gave positive responses to each category and indicated that telehealth appointments met their needs. Areas for clinical consideration are highlighted. Variables such as age, travel distance from hospital site, fear of COVID-19 and information technology (IT) access did not appear to influence patient preference for appointment type.\n",
      "Going forward, telehealth may be considered for use in combination with face-to-face appointments in the HNC pathway. Areas for further development include a 'telehealth screening tool' that may help to identify those patients most appropriate for these appointment types, or who require support to access them.\n",

Services adapted to meet the needs of patients with many implementing telehealth into pathways. Studies exploring telehealth in speech and language therapy (SLT) services with the HNC population indicate positive results. It is clear telehealth has a role in modern healthcare and should not be viewed as a temporary solution to the pandemic. It is, however, recognized that embedding telehealth into pathways is not straightforward and requires ongoing review and evaluation, which includes patient and clinician perceptions. What this study adds to the existing knowledge The service evaluation gives insight into HNC patient experience of telehealth appointments for MDT clinics (led by SLT, dietician and clinical nurse specialist) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, patients report a positive experience of telehealth in the HNC pathway and are willing to accept this platform into their healthcare. Areas for clinical consideration are highlighted. What are the actual and clinical implications of this work? This findings of this service evaluation can be used to support the co-design of HNC pathways which embed telehealth as an option for patients. Areas that were important to the participants are highlighted; this includes the timing of telehealth appointments in the pathway, the need to meet the MDT face to face and the positive benefit of cost savings. The authors suggest a telehealth appointment screening tool as an area for future development.\n",

Research identifies information sharing or withholding as a key aspect of caregivers' ability to cope and adjust, which may be especially critical when a parent is diagnosed with advanced cancer. The goal of this study was to examine the impact of parent information sharing/withholding on EYACs' caregiving and coping experiences. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 33 EYACs between the ages of 18-35 who cared for a parent that died of advanced cancer. Interview transcripts were thematically analyzed. Three factors played a role in how parents' information sharing/withholding affected EYACs' caregiving/coping: 1) \n",

      "One hundred SF 36 questionnaires, fifty from each group were collected between October 2019 and March 2020 in this cross-sectional study. Demographic characteristics of the patients (sex, age, cancer type, presence of relapse, duration of follow-up) and education level of parents were recorded. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0.\n",
      "Turkish parents reported better results in physical functioning, emotional well-being, physical pain, general health, and physical health composite score (P < 0.05). There were more fathers in the Syrian group and education status was significant between the two groups (P = 0.01, P = 0.001, respectively). There was no correlation between QoL and education levels in the Turkish group. In Syrian parents, pain score was high in middle school graduates (P = 0.043). In the presence of relapse, although the physical function score decreased, the physical role function score increased in Turkish parents (P = 0.0035, P = 0.005, respectively).

      "Different imaging techniques are used in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The low sensitivity of mammography to detect cancer in the dense breast parenchyma and the lack of standard application of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) are some of the problems. Therefore, breast cancer imaging techniques should be compared in terms of conspicuity and characterization of lesions.\n",
      "Full-field digital mammography (DM) and synthetic mammography (SM) which are obtained from the slices of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) give similar results in terms of conspicuity and characterization of the lesions in detecting breast cancer.\n",
      "In this retrospective study, 47 women diagnosed with breast cancer were included in the study. DM, SM, and DBT images were evaluated by scoring the conspicuity of the index lesion in the parenchyma and its characterization in terms of contour and shape with a 4-point scale. In addition, the conspicuity of the lesions in relation to lesion size and breast density was examined with these three techniques.\n",
      "There is no significant difference between DM and SM techniques for index lesion conspicuity and characterization; however, the imaging score of DBT is significantly higher than other techniques for the conspicuity and characterization of the lesions. In terms of the conspicuity of the lesions in relation to lesion size, DM and SM techniques show significant difference according to the size of the lesion, whereas the DBT technique did not show significant difference. While mammography type is a determinant of lesion conspicuity in only DM and SM techniques, conspicuity findings do not differ significantly in the DBT technique.\n",
      "In conclusion, it was shown that standard images and SM images obtained from DBT did not differ significantly in terms of conspicuity and characterization of lesions. Thus, DBT is significantly superior to the DM and SM images. While the DM and SM images are more successful in showing large lesions and lesion detection in nondense breasts, DBT images were not affected by lesion size and breast density.\n",
      "Drug discovery has customarily focused on a de novo design approach, which is extremely expensive and takes several years to evolve before reaching the market. Discovering novel therapeutic benefits for the current drugs could contribute to new treatment alternatives for individuals with complex medical demands that are safe, inexpensive, and timely. In this consequence, when pharmaceutically yield and oncology drug efficacy appear to have hit a stalemate, drug repurposing is a fascinating method for improving cancer treatment. This review gathered about how in silico drug repurposing offers the opportunity to quickly increase the anticancer drug arsenal and, more importantly, overcome some of the limits of existing cancer therapies against both old and new therapeutic targets in oncology. The ancient nononcology compounds' innovative potential targets and important signaling pathways in cancer therapy are also discussed. This review also includes many plant-derived chemical compounds that have shown potential anticancer properties in recent years. Here, we have also tried to bring the spotlight on the new mechanisms to support clinical research, which may become increasingly essential in the future; at the same time, the unsolved or failed clinical trial study should be reinvestigated further based on the techniques and information provided. These encouraging findings, combined together, will through new insight on repurposing more non-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer.\n",
      "Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common symptom experienced by all the cancer patients at all stages of the disease and in survivors. Fatigue from cancer is one of the understated, underestimated, and least managed. Several scales have been developed to measure CRF, but they vary in the quality of psychometric properties, ease of administration, and dimensions of CRF. This systematic review explores the validity and reliability of the different CRF measurement scales. A systematic review methodology was followed to identify the scales that have been validated to measure CRF. Three separate databases PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar searches were performed using different medical subject heading terms. Articles were analyzed for validity and reliability. A total of 1294 articles from three different searches identified 15 scales (unidimensional and multidimensional). Each scale varied by its psychometric properties, items, scale type, dimension, site of cancer, and population in which it is validated. Most of the scales had been validated in mixed cancer populations. Some scales are insensitive to differences in fatigue to cancer stages. Few scales are burdensome for the advanced cancer patients. In this study, 15 CRF scales were identified. Validity and reliability are varied by each questionnaire. The ideal and accepted item numbers, scale, and domains are not established. The psychometric properties of each measure require further consideration. More studies are needed to explore fatigue scales with many populations.\n",

      "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest malignancies. Partner of NOB1 homolog (PNO1) has been reported to be involved in tumorigenesis. However, the role of PNO1 in PC remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of PNO1 on the progression of PC and the possible mechanism related to E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), a transcription factor predicted by the JASPAR database to bind to the PNO1 promoter region and promoted the proliferation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. First, PNO1 expression in PC tissues and its association with survival rate were analyzed by the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database. Western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to evaluate PNO1 expression in several PC cell lines. After PNO1 silencing, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were measured by colony formation assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining, wound healing, and transwell assays. Then, the lipid reactive oxygen species in PANC-1 cells was estimated by using C11-BODIPY\n",
      "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in men. To investigate the role of pre-mRNA processing factor 19 (PRPF19) in proliferation, migration of PCa, and evaluate the potential ability of PRPF19 as a therapeutic target. PRPF19 expression was analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas and GEPIA databank. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the transcription of PRPF9 and solute carrier family 40 member 1 (SLC40A1). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to test PRPF9 expression in PCa tissues. The cell viability and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation analysis were performed to assess cell proliferation. Transwell assay was performed to investigate the migration and invasion of cancer cells. Western blot was used to measure the expression level of PRPF9, E-cadherin, Vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), SLC40A1, LC3, Beclin-1 and ATG7. Immunofluorescence assay was performed to measure LC3 expression in PCa cells. The bioinformatic analysis revealed PRPF19 was highly expressed in PCa which was certified by qRT-PCR, western blot and IHC detection in PCa tissues. The proliferation of PCa cells could be promoted by PRPF19 overexpression and suppressed by PRPF19 knockdown. Moreover, the migration and invasion of PCa cells could be positively regulated by PRPF19 which promoted the expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin, and α-SMA. Furthermore, the expression of LC3, Beclin-1, and ATG7 was negatively regulated by PRPF19, indicating that PRPF19 inhibited autophagy in PCa cells. In the double knockdown of PRPF19 and SLC40A1, PRPF19 repressed the mRNA and reduced protein level of SLC40A1, and SLC40A1 antagonized effects of PRPF19 on proliferation, migration and autophagy of PCa cells. PRPF19 promoted proliferation and migration, and inhibited autophagy in PCa by attenuating SLC40A1 expression, indicating PRPF19 was a potential therapeutic target for PCa treatment.\n",
      "Cervical cancer leads to 300,000 deaths annually and the mechanism of cervical carcinogenesis remains unclear. Zeste White 10-interacting kinetochore protein (ZWINT) is uniquely elevated in malignancies, promoting proliferation, migration, and colony formation of cancer cells. To investigate the role of ZWINT in proliferation, migration, invasion of cervical cancer, and evaluate the potential ability of ZWINT as a therapeutic target. First, ZWINT expression in cervical cancer was analyzed using the bioinformatic methods and assessed in several cervical cancer cell lines. The cell viability and colony formation assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation. Then, transwell assay was performed to investigate cell migration and invasion. Moreover, western blot was used to measure the expression level of ZWINT, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), N-cadherin, E-cadherin, p53 and p21 in CaSki and HeLa cells with ZWINT overexpression or knockdown. The bioinformatic analysis and western blot assay revealed the expression of ZWINT was significantly increased in cervical cancer. The cell viability and colony formation analysis illustrated that cell proliferation could be promoted by ZWINT overexpression and suppressed by ZWINT knockdown. Moreover, ZWINT promoted migration and invasion of CaSki and HeLa cells, through regulating the expression of MMP-9, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin. Furthermore, ZWINT attenuated the expression of p53 and p21 in cervical cancer cells. In summary, ZWINT functions in promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells by suppressing p53/p21 signaling pathway, which indicated ZWINT is a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer treatment.\n",
      "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a cancer that occurs in the rectum or colon with a high incidence. Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5), a gene that regulates cell division, has been observed highly expressed in a variety of cancers, but its role in CRC is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory role of SPAG5 in CRC. The expression of SPAG5 in multiple cancers and normal tissues was predicted by The Cancer Genome Atlas and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, and the expression of SPAG5 in human normal intestinal epithelial cells NCM460 and human CRC cell lines Caco2, HT29, SW480, and LOVO was verified by western blotting (WB). The effects of silencing SPAG5 on cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were then investigated by cell counting kit-8, WB, and flow cytometry. The effects of silencing SPAG5 on cell migration and invasion were investigated by scratch assay and transwell assay. Finally, the phosphorylation levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT in cells were detected by WB. The results showed that SPAG5 was highly expressed in CRC and was verified by WB. Silencing of SPAG5 inhibited cell viability and proliferation and increased the cell apoptosis rate. Furthermore, both cell invasion and migration abilities were suppressed by the low expression of SPAG5. Finally, WB results found that the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and AKT were reduced after SPAG5 silencing. In summary, the results showed that SPAG5 can promote the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells by targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\n",
      "The morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer are increasing year by year, and the survival rate of prostate cancer patients after treatment is low. Therefore, investigating the molecular mechanism underlying prostate cancer is crucial for developing effective treatments. Recent studies have shown the important role of long-chain non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis. VPS9D1-AS1 can modulate the progression of multiple cancers, but its molecular action mechanism in prostate cancer remains unknown. This study, therefore, intended to investigate the regulatory mechanism of VPS9D1-AS1 in prostate cancer. First, differentially expressed lncRNAs in prostate cancer were identified through bioinformatics approaches. The target lncRNA for the study was determined by reviewing the relevant literature and its downstream miRNA/mRNA axis was uncovered. Then, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was introduced to assess the expression of VPS9D1-AS1, miR-187-3p, and fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1 (FGFRL1) at a cellular level, and Western blot was conducted to assess the protein level of FGFRL1 in cells. The results indicated that VPS9D1-AS1 and FGFRL1 were highly expressed in prostate cancer while miR-187-3p was less expressed. Besides, MTT, colony formation, wound healing, and cell invasion assays showed that silencing VPS9D1-AS1 inhibited the viability, migration ability, and invasion ability of prostate cancer cells. Dual-luciferase assay and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation assay were performed to explore the interplay of miR-187-3p and VPS9D1-AS1 or FGFRL1. The results showed that VPS9D1-AS1 could sponge miR-187-3p, and FGFRL1 could serve as a direct target of miR-187-3p. Moreover, combined with the results of the rescue experiment, VPS9D1-AS1 was found to upregulate FGFRL1 by competitively sponging miR-187-3p to accelerate the malignant behaviors of prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, VPS9D1-AS1 could promote the phenotype progression of prostate cancer cells through targeting the miR-187-3p/FGFRL1 axis, and it has the potential to be a target for prostate cancer patients.\n",
      "Given that mitochondrial dysregulation is a biomarker of many cancers, cationic quaternary phosphonium salt (QPS) conjugation is a widely utilized strategy for anticancer drug design. QPS-conjugated compounds exhibit greater cell permeation and accumulation in negatively charged mitochondria, and thus, show enhanced activity. Phylogenetic similarities between mitochondria and bacteria have provided a rationale for exploring the antibacterial properties of mitochondria-targeted compounds. Additionally, due to the importance of mitochondria in the survival of pathogenic microbes, including fungi and parasites, this strategy can be extended to these organisms as well. This review examines recent literature on the antimicrobial activities of various QPS-conjugated compounds and provides future directions for exploring the medicinal chemistry of these compounds.\n",
      "Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) is characterized by hemolysis and symptomatic anemia with no approved treatment options. Fostamatinib is an oral spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved in the US and Europe for treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia. In this phase 3 study, patients with an insufficient response to ≥1 prior wAIHA treatment were randomized to fostamatinib or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients to achieve a durable hemoglobin (Hgb) response (Hgb ≥10 g/dL and increase from baseline of ≥2 g/dL on 3 consecutive visits) during the 24-week treatment period. Ninety patients were randomized, 45 to each arm. Of the fostamatinib-treated patients, 35.6% achieved a durable Hgb response versus 26.7% on placebo (p = .398). A post hoc analysis revealed a large placebo response in Eastern European patients. Significantly more patients on fostamatinib from North America, Australia and Western Europe exhibited a durable Hgb response compared to placebo (36% vs. 10.7%, p = .030). After censoring for Hgb values impacted by steroid rescue received during screening and excluding 2 placebo patients found to likely not have wAIHA, a reanalysis demonstrated a difference in durable Hgb response between fostamatinib and placebo (15/45 [33.3%] vs. 6/43 [14.0%], p = .0395). At least 1 AE was reported in 42 (93.3%) and 40 (88.9%) patients receiving fostamatinib and placebo, respectively. The most common AEs in the fostamatinib group were diarrhea (26.7%), hypertension (24.4%), and fatigue (15.6%). In this study, fostamatinib demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit for patients in Western regions, and no new safety signals were identified.\n",
      "The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing globally. We aimed to assess the performance of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP-L3, des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), and GALAD score in detecting NAFLD-related HCC.\n",
      "We searched the relevant literature in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane. Conventional and network meta-analyses were performed for sensitivity, specificity, Youden index (YI), and the area under the summary receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC).\n",
      "Fifteen studies involving 2031 NAFLD participants were included in this meta-analysis. When detecting early-stage NAFLD-related HCC, GALAD score and DCP process excellent performance. The sensitivity and AUC of DCP (0.60, 0.74, respectively) were higher than AFP (0.34, 0.59, respectively). The network meta-analysis showed that DCP and GALAD score had similar performance. In detecting all-stage NAFLD-related HCC, GALAD score (sensitivity = 0.87; YI = 0.77) performed better than AFP (sensitivity = 0.56; YI = 0.50), AFP-L3 (sensitivity = 0.39; YI = 0.36) and DCP (sensitivity = 0.73; YI = 0.62). Network meta-analysis obtained consistent results with conventional meta-analysis.\n",

      "A 6 year-old spayed female Poodle presented with a mandibular mass. Radiographic examination revealed osteolysis from the right mandibular canine to the fourth premolar, along with horizontal bone loss and dorsal displacement of the right mandibular first and second premolars. Skull cone beam computed tomography revealed osteolysis at the level of the right mandibular canine and fourth premolar. A destructive bone lesion was observed in the apical area of the right mandibular canine, with mass invasion of the interradicular bone of the right mandibular first molar near the mandibular canal. Consequently, unilateral total mandibulectomy and skin flap surgery were performed. Histopathological examination revealed poorly demarcated and infiltrative neoplastic epithelial cells that formed small islands and trabeculae. Neoplastic cells exhibited the malignant features of cytological atypia and high mitotic activity. Furthermore, the neoplastic epithelial cells frequently showed ghost cell changes and were diagnosed as ghost cell odontogenic carcinoma (GCOC). The dog was followed up for 1 year, during which no severe complications or local recurrence was observed, except for slight mandibular drift, tongue protrusion, and drooling. This case report describes the clinical features, diagnostic imaging, and histologic features of an unreported GCOC in a dog and the favorable outcome following surgical resection.\n",
      "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a common skin cancer that can be treated effectively with limited morbidity if caught and treated early with elective surgical procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic caused most healthcare facilities to delay or defer elective surgeries as they allocated workforce and resources to treating significant increases of critically ill patients. This care delay has increased morbidity and mortality of many conditions treated with surgery. A few case reports exist on delayed elective surgeries' effects on patients and healthcare facilities. We report a case of cSCC enlarging and locally spreading due to elective surgery delay during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "The main target of neoadjuvant treatment in rectal cancer is to downstage and downsize large tumours to increase the chance of complete surgical resection, and therefore decrease the chances of local recurrence. With or without the addition of chemotherapy, until recently, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) used to be the radiotherapy treatment modality of choice. However, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is being increasingly adopted by many radiotherapy centres as a more modern, conformal technique due to its ability to minimize radiation dose to nearby organs. The aim of our analysis was to assess the difference in toxicity, response to treatment, and survival between the patients treated with these two different treatment modalities in our institution.\n",
      "We performed a retrospective analysis of data and compared two groups of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were treated with either 3D-CRT or IMRT. The main outcomes were radiation toxicity and response to treatment. Overall survival was a secondary outcome.\n",
      "One hundred and thirty-six patients were included in the study: 71 patients treated with 3D-CRT and 65 patients treated with IMRT. With regard to toxicity, there was no significant difference between the groups for bladder and skin toxicity, but there was a significant reduction in acute grade 2 bowel toxicity in patients treated with a long course of IMRT [3D-CRT 77% (48/62) vs IMRT 64% (30/47) p=0.042]. There was no statistically significant difference in the treatment response rates of these two radiotherapy treatment modalities, as well as in overall survival between the groups (p=0.604).  Conclusion: Our study showed that IMRT can significantly reduce acute bowel side effects for patients undergoing neoadjuvant radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancers. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical advantage of IMRT in rectal carcinoma.\n",
      "Prostate cancer and its treatment may affect patients' sexual function and social wellbeing. This study investigated the relationship between social/family wellbeing and sexual health in patients with prostate cancer. Additionally, the moderating effect of clinical characteristics on this relationship was also explored.\n",
      "This is a descriptive correlational study using baseline data of a longitudinal study enrolling 137 patients with prostate cancer. Sexual Function (SF) and Sexual Function Distress (SFD) data were collected using the Symptom Index questionnaire. Demographic data were obtained during study intake and clinical data were obtained from chart review. Bivariate correlation determined the correlations among continuous demographic/clinical data, social/family wellbeing, and sexual health. Moderated regression analysis determined the moderating effects of clinical characteristics on the relationship of social/family wellbeing and sexual health.\n",
      "Moderate positive correlation was found between social/family wellbeing and SF, whereas a weak negative correlation was noted between social/family wellbeing and SFD. Depression was significantly correlated with social/family wellbeing and SFD. Both sexual health domains were significantly correlated with Gleason score. A significant difference was noted in the social/family wellbeing and both SF and SFD in participants receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to those not receiving ADT. Concomitant ADT use was the only clinical characteristic found to be a significant moderator of the relationship between social/family wellbeing and SFD, but none of the clinical characteristics was found to have a moderating effect on the relationship of social/family wellbeing and SF. Among patients who were not receiving ADT, high social/family wellbeing was associated with low SFD. Patients who were receiving ADT reported slightly higher SFD despite having higher social/family wellbeing.\n",

      "Despite widespread recognition that communicating unexpected news during obstetric ultrasound examinations is challenging, there is a dearth of research investigating how to teach evidence-based communication to sonographers. Communication Coaching is a supportive, positive method that has previously been associated with improvements in communication, patient satisfaction, and reduced burnout in clinicians. However, to date, no study has coached sonographers. This study explored stakeholders' views on a proposed Communication Coaching intervention and used these data to adapt the intervention for use with qualified obstetric sonographers.\n",
      "Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people who have a vested interest in unexpected news delivery and thematic analysis was conducted on the data. Eight sonographers, six people with lived experience of receiving unexpected news and six representatives from third-sector organisations who support expectant parents were recruited (18 women; 2 men, aged between 21 and 75 years).\n",
      "Participants viewed the planned Communication Coaching intervention favourably and suggested adaptations. The two main themes were (1) the practicalities of coaching, and (2) content. The first theme had four subthemes: (a) brief and flexible structure, (b) online modality, (c) sensitive and positive coach and (d) organisational awareness. The second theme had three subthemes: (a) specific language and behaviour recommendations, (b) adaptable to different service-users and situations and (c) confer relevant emotional skills and techniques.\n",

      "The microcystic, elongated and fragmented pattern of invasion can be associated with an underestimation of the depth of myometrial invasion by imaging techniques. We aimed to evaluate the influence of microcystic, elongated and fragmented pattern of invasion in the diagnostic performance of transvaginal ultrasound scan and magnetic resonance imaging for the prediction of the depth of myometrial invasion in low-grade endometrioid endometrial carcinomas.\n",
      "Prospective and consecutive study including all low-grade (G1-G2) endometrioid endometrial carcinomas diagnosed between October 2013 and July 2018 in a tertiary hospital. Preoperative staging was performed with transvaginal ultrasound scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging followed by surgical staging. Final histology was considered as the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of depth of myometrial invasion was calculated for both imaging techniques. The STARD 2015 guidelines were used.\n",
      "A total of 136 patients were consecutively included. Transvaginal ultrasound scan was performed in 132 patients and magnetic resonance imaging in 119 patients. The diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound scan for the prediction of depth of myometrial invasion in the microcystic, elongated and fragmented negative group (82% (95% confidence interval = 73-88)) was higher compared to the microcystic, elongated and fragmented positive group (61% (95% confidence interval = 36-83)). The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging was also higher in the microcystic, elongated and fragmented negative group (80% (95% confidence interval = 71-87)) compared to the microcystic, elongated and fragmented positive (47% (95% confidence interval = 21-73)).\n",

      "Peripheral nerve sheath tumours are neurogenic neoplasms that arise from the nerve sheath which are not within the central nervous system. While most of these lesions may be benign, some of them may undergo malignant transformation, establishing why it is imperative for ultrasound practitioners to familiarise themselves with ultrasound presentations of this lesion to facilitate early and effective diagnosis, which would in turn positively impact patient management.\n",
      "We present an incidental finding of a thrombus-mimicking peripheral nerve sheath tumour in a female patient who came to the ultrasound department for a left leg deep vein thrombosis scan.\n",
      "This case study demonstrates a peripheral nerve sheath tumour which by virtue of its location (very closely adjacent the deep calf veins) and appearance (incompressible, heterogeneous, minimal colour flow), mimicked a deep calf vein thrombus on ultrasound. Careful surveillance of the area on ultrasound revealed the lesion was distinct from the calf vasculature, and further imaging was advised. A magnetic resonance imaging was conducted confirming the diagnosis of a peripheral nerve sheath tumour.\n",
      "In addition to assessing the lower limb venous system during deep venous thrombosis scans, sonographers should be mindful that other soft tissue lesions such as peripheral nerve sheath tumour may be present with symptoms that mimic those of a thrombotic leg, and therefore check to exclude or confirm the presence of any adjacent soft tissue lesions, especially at the symptomatic site indicated by the patient.\n",
      "The poor prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is vastly due to late diagnosis. The oral submucosal fibrosis (OSMF) is often unnoticed pathology linked with high risk of malignancy. Recently, we demonstrated that the clinicopathological alterations in OSMF and OSCC patients were correlated with cancer stem cell (CSCs) markers (CD133 and CD44). However, the parallel alterations of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) with CSCs expression are largely unexplored. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationship between IL-1β alterations and CSC marker expression in both OSMF and OSCC situations.\n",
      "A total of 135 people have signed up for the study. There were sixty each in OSMF and OSCC groups, as well as 15 healthy controls. Levels of serum IL-1β were examined by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine the expression of CD133 and CD44. For evaluating differential CSCs expression, IHC scoring (0-4) was utilized.\n",
      "The IHC results showed maximum subjects in the OSMF and OSCC displaying CD44 and CD133 positivity, although the extent of expression in terms of IHC scoring found variable. CD133 and CD44-positive subjects showed increased levels of IL-1β in the OSMF and OSCC group. Nevertheless, the enhancement of IL-1β is more pronounced in the OSCC cases. Further, we observed a direct link of IL-1β levels with IHC scoring. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a significant role for CD44 and CD133 positivity in the increase of IL-1β levels.\n",
      "We concluded that concurrent simultaneous changes in CSC biomarkers and IL-1β may help with early detection of OSMF and OSCC conditions.\n",
      "Acoustic manipulation techniques have gained significant attention across various fields, particularly in medical diagnosis and biochemical research, due to their biocompatibility and non-contact operation. In this article, we review the broad range of biomedical applications of micro/nano-motors that use acoustic manipulation methods, with a specific focus on cell manipulation, targeted drug release for cancer treatment and genetic disease diagnosis. These applications are facilitated by acoustic-propelled micro/nano-motors and nanoparticles which are manipulated by acoustic tweezers. Acoustic systems enable high precision positioning and can be effectively combined with magnetic manipulation techniques. Furthermore, acoustic propulsion facilitates faster transportation speeds, making it suitable for tasks in blood flow, allowing for precise positioning and in-body manipulation of cells, microprobes, and drugs. By summarizing and understanding these acoustic manipulation methods, this review aims to provide a summary and discussion of the acoustic manipulation methods for biomedical research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications.\n",

      "Functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are widely used in therapeutic applications, but little is known regarding the impact of their surface functionalization in the process of toxicity against cancer cells. This study investigates the anticancer effects of 5 nm spherical AuNPs functionalized with tannate, citrate, and PVP on deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in human lung alveolar adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. Our findings show that functionalized AuNPs reduce the cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner as measured by modified lactate dehydrogenase (mLDH) and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. An increased generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio was observed with the highest AuNP concentration of 10 μg/mL. The expression of DUBs such as ubiquitin specific proteases (USP7, USP8, and USP10) was slightly inhibited when treated with concentrations above 2.5 μg/mL. Moreover, functionalized AuNPs showed an inhibitory effect on protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling proteins, and this could further trigger mitochondrial related-apoptosis by the upregulation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP in A549 cells. Furthermore, our study shows a mechanistic understanding of how functionalized AuNPs inhibit the DUBs, consequently suppressing cell proliferation, and can be modulated as an approach toward anticancer therapy. The study also warrants the need for future work to investigate the effect of functionalized AuNPs on DUB on other cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.\n",

      "The antitumor effects elicited by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatments. However, severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) resulting from these treatments have restricted the application of ICIs. To overcome the adverse events, we developed a tumor lesion-selective pro-PD-1Ig that is activated by proteases overexpressed in tumors. We genetically linked albumin to the N-terminus of a modified PD-1Ig (termed mutPD-1Ig hereafter) via an MMP substrate sequence to form Alb-hinge-mutPD-1Ig. We demonstrate that the binding activity of nondigested Alb-hinge-mutPD-1Ig is approximately 11-folds lower than mutPD-1Ig. However, digestion by type IV collagenase restored the binding activity of Alb-hinge-mutPD-1Ig to a level comparable to that of native mutPD-1Ig. In order to enhance the masking efficiency of Alb-mutPD-1Ig, we simulated the effects of diverse MMP substrate linkers for connecting albumin and PD-1 at various starting positions by bioinformatics tools. Our validation experiments indicate Alb-hinge-mutPD-1Ig displayed the best masking efficiency among all simulated constructs. Our study suggests that albumin may be best applicable to mask a target protein whose binding motif is centralized and in the proximity of the N-terminus of the protein.\n",

      "Pancreatic mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinomas are rare malignant tumors of the pancreas. They are composed histologically of both acinar and neuroendocrine cells. The pancreatic duct is known to be an important site of tumor growth for acinar cell carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms. To the best of our knowledge, there has been only 1 report of a mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinoma growing into the pancreatic duct and no reports detailing imaging findings with this tumor. We here report a 69-year-old man who presented with worsening glycemic control. Multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-circumscribed mass with poor contrast enhancement in the pancreatic tail region of the pancreatic duct. The intraductal mass showed diffusion restriction on magnetic resonance imaging. These imaging findings are consistent with the expansive, smooth-surfaced polypoid tumor of low vascularity and high cellularity that was diagnosed pathologically. Mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinomas should be included in the differential diagnosis of intraductal tumors of the pancreas with poor contrast enhancement and diffusion restriction.\n",
      "Patients with central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma face limited treatment options and poor treatment outcomes, emphasizing the urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies. One limiting factor contributing to the suboptimal efficacy is the inadequate penetration of most treatment drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent insights into the pathophysiology of CNS lymphoma have identified the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling pathway as a potential target. Some clinical trials have shown impressive responses to BTK inhibitors in CNS lymphoma. However, currently approved BTK inhibitors have low BBB penetration rates, limiting their efficacy. In this study, we discovered that JDB175, a novel and highly selective BTK inhibitor, exhibits excellent BBB penetration capabilities and demonstrates favorable activity in a mouse model of CNS lymphoma while showing no significant signs of toxicity. JDB175 effectively inhibits the BTK signaling pathway in human lymphoma cells, suppressing their proliferation, inducing cell cycle arrest, and promoting apoptosis. The significance of this study lies in addressing the critical unmet medical need for effective treatments for CNS lymphoma. This finding indicates a promising avenue for improved treatments in CNS lymphoma, potentially opening doors for further clinical investigation and therapeutic advancements.\n",
      "Fasting has been grown in popularity with multiple potential benefits. However, very few studies dynamically monitor physiological and pathological changes during long-term fasting using noninvasive methods. In the present study, we recruited 37 individuals with metabolic syndrome to engage in a 5-day water-only fasting regimen, and simultaneously captured the molecular alterations through urinary proteomics and metabolomics. Our findings reveal that water-only fasting significantly mitigated metabolic syndrome-related risk markers, such as body weight, body mass index, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose levels in metabolic syndrome patients. Indicators of liver and renal function remained within the normal range, with the exception of uric acid. Notably, inflammatory response was inhibited during the water-only fasting period, as evidenced by a decrease in the human monocyte differentiation antigen CD14. Intriguingly, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation underwent a sex-dependent reprogramming throughout the fasting period, whereby males exhibited a greater upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism-related enzymes than females. This disparity may be attributed to evolutionary pressures. Collectively, our study sheds light on the beneficial physiological effects and novel dynamic molecular features associated with fasting in individuals with metabolic syndrome using noninvasive methods.\n",
      "The gut microbiota and its homeostasis play a crucial role in human health. However, for some diseases related to the gut microbiota, current traditional medicines can only relieve symptoms, and it is difficult to solve the root causes or even cause side effects like disturbances in the gut microbiota. Increasing clinical studies and evidences have demonstrated that probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics can prevent and treat various diseases, but currently they can only be used as dietary supplements rather than medicines, which restricts the application of probiotics in the field of medicine. Here, this review analyzes the importance of gut microbiota in human health and the current problems of traditional medicines, and systematically summarizes the effectiveness and mechanisms of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics in maintaining health and treating diseases based on animal models and clinical trials. And based on current research outcomes and development trends in this field, the challenges and prospects of their clinical application in maintaining health, alleviating and treating diseases are analyzed.

      "Subepithelial lesions (SELs) originating from muscularis mucosae of the colon are very rare findings on endoscopy. Appropriate management of SELs involves making a correct diagnosis and estimating their malignant potential. In this case study, a 58-year-old Saudi man presented with a small, 8-mm sigmoid polyp during screening colonoscopy. The polyp was removed by hot snare polypectomy and sent to pathology laboratory. Report showed an unremarkable colonic mucosa and underlying well-circumscribed submucosal lesion composed of monotonous spindle cells. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis ruled out CD117-/DOG1-positive GIST and confirmed the lesion as leiomyomatous polyp. Colonic leiomyomas are usually benign and often asymptomatic and discovered during CRC screening procedures. Diagnosis is made on histology/IHC analysis since endoscopically they might be indistinguishable from other SELs. Conventional polypectomy is an appropriate treatment for small colonic leiomyoma and these benign lesions typically do not recur.\n",

Neonates with final diagnosis with sepsis were divided into the sepsis group, The remaining neonates were divided into the control group. Neonates with sepsis were further categorized into mild (n = 312) and severe (n = 425) groups based on the severity of their condition. FAR was determined by dividing the plasma fibrinogen concentration (g/L) by the serum albumin concentration (g/L). The statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS 26.0 statistical software package, as deemed appropriate.\n",

      "KNL1 was abnormally upregulated in more than half of cancers across different databases. IHC and real-time PCR verified the up-regulated expression in cancer tissues in PAAD, gastric cancer, and BLCA. The satisfactory diagnostic value of KNL1 was indicated in 30 cancers and high KNL1 expression was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) in 12 cancers. The prognostic role of KNL1 as a predictive biomarker of PAAD was clarified. KNL1 played an active part in the cell cycle and cell proliferation. Moreover, KNL1 was likely to mold the Th2-dominant suppressive tumor immune microenvironment and was associated with TMB, MSI, and immune checkpoint-related genes in pan-cancer.\n",

      "E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) play a pivotal role in regulating the specificity of protein ubiquitination, and their significant functions as regulators of immune responses against tumors are attracting considerable interest. RBCK1-an RBR E3 ligase-is involved in immune regulation and tumor development. However, the potential effect of RBCK1 on glioma remains enigmatic. In the present study, we performed comprehensive analyses of multilevel data, which disclosed distribution characteristics of RBCK1 in pan-cancer, especially in glioma. Functional roles of RBCK1 were further confirmed using immunohistochemistry, cell biological assays, and xenograft experiments. Aberrant ascending of RBCK1 in multiple types of cancer was found to remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma by regulating immunomodulators, cancer immunity cycles, and immune cell infiltration. Notably, the MES-like/RBCK1\n",

      "Digital pathology technologies, including whole slide imaging (WSI), have significantly improved modern clinical practices by facilitating storing, viewing, processing, and sharing digital scans of tissue glass slides. Researchers have proposed various artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for digital pathology applications, such as automated image analysis, to extract diagnostic information from WSI for improving pathology productivity, accuracy, and reproducibility. Feature extraction methods play a crucial role in transforming raw image data into meaningful representations for analysis, facilitating the characterization of tissue structures, cellular properties, and pathological patterns. These features have diverse applications in several digital pathology applications, such as cancer prognosis and diagnosis. Deep learning-based feature extraction methods have emerged as a promising approach to accurately represent WSI contents and have demonstrated superior performance in histology-related tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of feature extraction methods, including both manual and deep learning-based techniques, for the analysis of WSIs. We review relevant literature, analyze the discriminative and geometric features of WSIs (i.e., features suited to support the diagnostic process and extracted by \"engineered\" methods as opposed to AI), and explore predictive modeling techniques using AI and deep learning. This survey examines the advances, challenges, and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field, emphasizing the potential for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and decision-making in digital pathology.\n",

This retrospective cohort study evaluated the severity of dry eye disease (DED) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Patients with T2DM who were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors were assigned to the SGLT2 group. Each patient in the SGLT2 group was matched to two individuals with T2DM who had not used SGLT2 inhibitors, constituting the control group. The primary outcomes were the development of DED and severe DED. A diagnosis of severe DED was indicated by the usage of cyclosporine. Cox proportional hazard regression was applied to yield adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the SGLT2 group, 1864 new DED events and 147 severe DED events were recorded. Conversely, 4367 new DED events and 392 severe DED events were recorded in the control group.

      "Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide. Due to its late diagnosis, it remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite it is mostly associated to tobacco smoking, recent data suggested that genetic factors are of the highest importance. In this context, different processes meaningful for the development and progression of lung cancer such endocytosis, protein secretion and signal transduction, are controlled by membrane rafts. These highly ordered membrane domains contain proteins such as caveolins and flotillins, which were traditionally considered scaffold proteins but have currently been given a preponderant role in lung cancer. Here, we summarize current knowledge regarding the involvement of caveolins and flotillins in lung cancer from a molecular point of view.\n",

She was found to have a beta-hCG of >12,000 mIU/mL and free fluid noted on a focused assessment with sonography in trauma exam. She underwent an emergent diagnostic laparoscopy due to the suspicion of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Findings at the time of surgery included a normal-appearing uterus and left fallopian tube, a surgically absent right fallopian tube and large volume hemoperitoneum with a rapidly expanding left retroperitoneal hematoma. A postoperative computerized tomography (CT) angiogram suggested active bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm of the left renal artery which was successfully embolized by interventional radiology.

      "The administration of chemotherapy to cancer patients with organ dysfunction raises concerns regarding its safety. The safety profile of patients with organ dysfunction due to rare diseases treated with chemotherapy plus immune checkpoint inhibitor is limited. Fibrinogen storage disease (FSD) is a rare disease that causes liver dysfunction through endoplasmic reticulum stress response due to abnormal accumulation of fibrinogen in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. Although chemotherapy plus nivolumab is recommended as a standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC), its safety profile for patients with FSD is rarely available. In this study, an 80-year-old male with gastric cancer with positive lavage cytology was scheduled to receive palliative chemotherapy. This case had liver dysfunction of unknown cause, and a liver biopsy was performed. Histopathological findings revealed a diagnosis of type II/III fibrinogen inclusion based on morphology and immunohistochemistry. Liver function was recovered by administering ursodeoxycholic acid. Therefore, the combination chemotherapy of S-1, oxaliplatin, with nivolumab as palliative chemotherapy was initiated. The case responded well to chemotherapy and achieved conversion surgery without worsening of liver function.

      "Hypochlorous acid is a reactive oxygen species that is widely present in the body and has been found to exhibit an elevated concentration in tumors. As a result, fluorescent probes for tumor detection have recently gained significant attention. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel ratiometric fluorescent probe, LW-1, using coumarin as a scaffold, and characterized its spectral properties. LW-1 displayed indigo blue fluorescence at low concentrations of hypochlorous acid. As the concentration of hypochlorous acid increased, the probe underwent a reaction, resulting in a red shift in its fluorescence peak and exhibiting green fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity ratio (green/blue) was a susceptible detection signal for HClO. LW-1 exhibited favorable characteristics, including a low detection limit, high sensitivity, good stability, and low background interference. The detection limit has reached 2.4642 nM.

      "The optical features of gold nanorods (GNR) may be precisely controlled by manipulating their size, shape, and aspect ratio. This review explores the impact of these parameters on the optical tuning of (GNR). By altering the experimental conditions, like the addition of silver ions during the seed-mediated growth process, the aspect ratio of (GNR) may be regulated. The shape is trans from spherical to rod-like structures resulting in noticeable changes in the nanoparticles surface plasmons resonance (SPR) bands. The longitudinal SPR band, associated with electron oscillations along the long axis, exhibits a pronounced red shift into the (NIR) region as the aspect ratio increases. In contrast, the transverse SPR band remains relate unchanged. Using computational methods like the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) allows for analyzing absorption, scattering, and total extinction features of gold (G) nanoparticles. Studies have shown that increasing the aspect ratio enhances the scattering efficiency, indicating a higher scattering quantum yield (QY). These findings highlight the importance of size, shape, and aspect ratio in controlling the optical features of (GNR) providing valuable insights for various uses in nanophotonics and plasmonic-dependent fluorescence in cancer treatment and developing new photonic compound NRs.\n",

      "Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease that in recent years has become a major international public health concern. Dengue is a tropical neglected disease with increasing global incidences, affecting millions of people worldwide, and without the availability of specific treatments to combat it. The identification of host-target genes essential for the virus life cycle, for which effective modulators may already exist, would provide an alternative path to a rapid drug development of the much needed antidengue agents. For this purpose, we performed the first genome-wide RNAi screen, combining two high-content readouts for dengue virus infection (DENV E infection intensity) and host cell toxicity (host cell stained nuclei), against an arrayed lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA library covering 16,000 genes with a redundancy of at least 5 hairpins per gene. The screen identified 1924 gene candidates in total; of which, 1730 gene candidates abrogated dengue infection, whereas 194 gene candidates were found to enhance its infectivity in HEK293 cells. A first pass clustering analysis of hits revealed a well-orchestrated gene-network dependency on host cell homeostasis and physiology triggering distinct cellular pathways for infectivity, replication, trafficking, and egress; a second analysis revealed a comprehensive gene signature of 331 genes common to hits identified in 28 published RNAi host-viral interaction screens. Taken together, our findings provide novel antiviral molecular targets with the potential for drug discovery and development.\n",

      "Electronic health records and liver MRI-proton density fat fraction (PDFF) were used to define NAFLD cases. FLI was calculated and individuals with high alcohol intake and other liver diseases were excluded. Using listwise deletion analysis, the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of FLI for NAFLD risk was determined. Thereafter, time-dependent covariate-adjusted Cox regression models were used to estimate FLI's risk stratification potential for comorbidities of interest.\n",
      "FLI was derived for 327,800 individuals with a median age of 58 (IQR 51.5-64.5), of whom 59.8% were females. Using Perspectum Diagnostics and AMRA protocols as references, FLI identified the risk of NAFLD with AUROCs (95% CI, n) of 0.858 (0.848-0.867, n = 7,566) and 0.851 (0.844-0.856, n = 10,777), respectively. Intermediate and high-risk FLI was associated with increased cardiometabolic and malignant disease. In the first 3 years, high-risk FLI conferred an increased risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 95% CI) of ischaemic heart disease (2.14, 1.94-2.36), hypertension (2.84, 2.70-2.98), type 2 diabetes mellitus (4.55, 4.04-5.12), dyslipidaemia (2.48, 2.32-2.64), ischaemic stroke (1.31, 1.20-1.42) and hepatic malignancy (1.69, 1.23-2.30). FLI was not associated with risk of extrahepatic malignancy but was associated with a higher risk of specific cancers (colon, upper gastrointestinal and breast). All-cause mortality was similarly stratified by FLI, independently of non-invasive fibrosis scores.\n",
      "FLI identifies NAFLD and holds potential for the risk stratification of cardiometabolic and malignant disease outcomes (including some extrahepatic malignancies), as well as all-cause mortality. Its use in population screening for primary and secondary prevention of NAFLD should be considered.\n",

      "Sleep deprivation (SD) causes several adverse functional outcomes, and understanding the associated processes can improve quality of life. Although the effects of SD on neuronal activity in several brain regions have been identified, a comprehensive evaluation of the whole brain is still lacking. Hence, we performed SD using two different methods, gentle handling and a dedicated chamber, in targeted recombination in active populations 2 (TRAP2) mice crossed with Rosa-ZsGreen reporter mice and visualized cellular activity in the whole brain. Using the semi-automated post-imaging analysis tool Slice Histology Alignment, Registration, and Cell Quantification (SHARCQ), the number of activated cells was quantified. From the analysis of 14 brain regions, cellular activity was significantly increased in the olfactory areas and decreased in the medulla by the two SD methods. From the analysis of the further subdivided 348 regions, cellular activity was significantly increased in the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, lateral hypothalamic area, parabigeminal nucleus, ventral tegmental area, and magnocellular reticular nucleus, and decreased in the anterior part of the basolateral amygdalar nucleus, nucleus accumbens, septohippocampal nucleus, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, preoptic part of the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventromedial preoptic nucleus, rostral linear nucleus raphe, facial motor nucleus, vestibular nuclei, and some fiber tracts (oculomotor nerve, genu of corpus callosum, and rubrospinal tract) by the two SD methods. Two subdivided regions of the striatum (caudoputamen and other striatum), epithalamus, vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, anteroventral preoptic nucleus, superior colliculus optic layer, medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, pontine gray, and fiber tracts (medial lemniscus, columns of the fornix, brachium of the inferior colliculus, and mammillary peduncle) were differentially affected by the two SD methods. Most brain regions detected from these analyses have been reported to be involved in regulating sleep/wake regulatory circuits. Moreover, the results from the connectivity analysis indicated that the connectivity of cellular activity among brain regions was altered by SD. Together, such a comprehensive analysis of the whole brain is useful for understanding the mechanisms by which SD and/or sleep disruption affects brain function.\n",
      "Laryngeal carcinoma is the most common head and neck cancer. The vast majority of laryngeal carcinomas are of squamous-cell histologic type. Metastasis of laryngeal cancer typically occurs within the cervical lymph nodes and seldom in other regions. Although a small percentage of patients experience distant metastases, bone marrow metastasis from laryngeal cancer is among the least common metastatic sites. Previous literature has suggested that bone marrow carcinomatosis is aggressive and has a poor outcome, particularly in patients with supraglottic tumors. Ante-mortem diagnosis of this metastatic pattern has been limited. To our knowledge, this case report highlights the first documented occurrence wherein the utilization of 18-fluorine fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT imaging played a pivotal role in the early detection of bone marrow metastasis in a patient diagnosed with transglottic laryngeal cancer. A solitary metastatic distant bone marrow lesion was identified early during follow-up. As a consequence, the patient exhibited a remarkable and unforeseen favorable clinical outcome.\n",
      "Certain viruses called tumor viruses or oncoviruses are capable to change the gene expression pattern of distinct human or animal cell types in tissue culture, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation as well as a change in the social behavior of the infected cells: the oncovirus-transformed, immortalized cells are capable to form malignant neoplasms in suitable animal models. At present, seven human viruses are categorized as causative agents of distinct human malignancies. The genomes of human tumor viruses, typically encode viral oncoproteins and non- translated viral RNAs that affect the gene expression pattern of their target cells or induce genetic and epigenetic alterations contributing to oncogenesis. Recently, the application of chromatin conformation capture technologies and three-dimensional (3D) molecular imaging techniques revealed how the gene products or genomes of certain human tumor viruses interact with and induce alterations in the 3D host genome structure. This Mini Review aims to cover selected aspects of these developments. The papers, discussed briefly, describe how insertion of a novel viral binding site for the 3D genome organizer cellular protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) into the DNA of T cells infected by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) may contribute to lymphomagenesis, as well as how integration of high risk human papillomavirus genome into the host cell DNA may facilitate cervical carcinogenesis. Recent results regarding the interactions of cellular genomes with the episomal, chromatinized DNA genomes of oncogenic human herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will also be summarized, similarly to available data regarding contacts formed by episomal or integrated hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA with host chromatin. Finally, a putative mechanism of hepatitis C virus (HCV) induced chromatin alterations will be presented, which may solve the riddle, how a cytoplasmic RNA virus without a viral oncogene could induce malingnant transfrormation of hepatocytes.\n",

      "By using the bibliometric analysis tool CiteSpace and based on the articles of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, the country, institution, highly cited literature, keywords and so on were visually analyzed.\n",
      "A total of 356 research articles on CRC from 2001 to 2023 were thoroughly analyzed. The USA and China have made the largest contribution in the field of virus and CRC. The Helmholtz Association published the most papers. There were relatively few cooperations among institutions from different countries. The results of keyword cluster analysis proved that the literature on the relationship between human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and CRC was the most widely studied aspect in this field. \"Gut microbiota,\" \"inflammatory bowel disease,\" \"hepatitis b virus,\" and \"human papillomavirus infection\" are the current research hotspots; \"oncolytic virus,\" \"apoptosis,\" and \"gut microbiome\" are the recent research frontiers and should be paid closer attention.\n",

      "Recently, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of cancer, HIV, and other noncommunicable diseases globally. Thus, the demand for palliative care (PC), including end-of-life care, continues to grow worldwide. Physiotherapy has an important role in PC as it aims to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life by optimising independent levels of function.\n",
      "To assess the level of knowledge, awareness and current practice of PC amongst Nigerian physiotherapists in clinical practice.\n",
      "Our study used a cross-sectional descriptive census-based method and recruited practising physiotherapists in Nigeria. An electronic questionnaire was used to collect data over 12 weeks, comprising 36 semistructured questions in four domains: personal information, knowledge, awareness and current practices regarding PC. Data were analysed using a pragmatist paradigm.\n",

      "The complexity of a gunshot wound to the hand with segmental bone loss and adjacent joint disruption presents a unique challenge for the reconstructive surgeon. There are several options for posttraumatic reconstruction of hand joint defects, ranging from arthrodesis, implants, and autologous arthroplasty. Despite the abundance of literature regarding guidelines for isolated osteoplasty and arthroplasty, there are only case reports describing management of bone and joint defects, all within the setting of cancer resection. This case report presents a 24-year-old, right-hand dominant man with a gunshot wound to his left hand involving the fifth metacarpal and metacarpal phalangeal joint. The metacarpal was reconstructed with a fibular bone allograft with simultaneous placement of a silicone arthroplasty implant, allowing preservation of motion at the metacarpal phalangeal joint with satisfactory functional outcomes. This illustrates the feasibility of successfully reconstructing segmental bone loss and adjacent joint defects simultaneously in the traumatic setting of firearm injuries.\n",
      "Conversion to a prepectoral implant pocket is considered the definitive treatment for breast animation after implant-based breast reconstruction. Although subtle movement of implants placed in the prepectoral plane may be noted on clinical examination by experienced surgeons, current data demonstrate complete resolution of animation deformity with prepectoral implant placement. We present the case of a middle-aged women who underwent breast implant pocket conversion from dual-plane to prepectoral plane for treatment of animation deformity. Although her postoperative recovery was unremarkable with initial resolution of animation, recurrent implant animation was evident on 3-month follow-up. Recurrent breast animation after conversion from dual-plane to prepectoral implant pocket is highly unusual and unreported in the current literature. Although revision surgery may identify potential causes, larger-scale research on contributing factors will be valuable in developing strategies to prevent recurrent animation after conversion to a prepectoral implant pocket.\n",
      "Extraintestinal manifestations occur rather frequently in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease patients and are usually related to an exacerbation of the underlying intestinal bowel disease but sometimes may run a course independent of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). About one-third of patients with IBD develop extraintestinal manifestations, such as pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). PG is an uncommon inflammatory skin disorder of unknown pathogenesis. There are no specific serological or histological markers, and diagnosis is predominantly clinical. Topical and systemic therapies are both vital aspects of treatment and immune modulators have been used with increasing success in recent years, although immunosuppressive drugs raise some concerns due to an increased risk of serious and opportunistic infections and cancer, particularly in elderly and comorbid patients, underlining the unmet need for safer alternative therapies. Thus, in this case report, we highlighted an adsorptive granulocyte/monocyte apheresis (GMA) as a new therapeutic possibility in IBD patients with extraintestinal manifestations. We report a case of a 60-year woman with a history of UC with a Mayo grade 3 score which was associated with a PG. Given that the patients maintained clinical remission with vedolizumab, we preferred not to perform a combined treatment with other antitumor necrosis factor-alpha or ciclosporin, thus avoiding an increased risk of serious infections in the patient. Therefore, we performed the extracorporeal leukocyte apheresis. The patient progressed favorably, with progressive improvement of skin and bowel disease. Therefore, adsorptive GMA has a very favorable safety profile and has been confirmed in numerous studies. In this study, we underlined that an intensive regimen of GMA paves the way to an ideal option for patients with severe and refractory PG complicated with UC.\n",
      "Automation is desirable for organ segmentation in radiotherapy. This study compared deep learning methods for auto-segmentation of organs-at-risk (OARs) and clinical target volume (CTV) in prostate cancer patients undergoing fractionated magnetic resonance (MR)-guided adaptive radiation therapy. Models predicting dense displacement fields (DDFMs) between planning and fraction images were compared to patient-specific (PSM) and baseline (BM) segmentation models.\n",
      "A dataset of 92 patients with planning and fraction MR images (MRIs) from two institutions were used. DDFMs were trained to predict dense displacement fields (DDFs) between the planning and fraction images, which were subsequently used to propagate the planning contours of the bladder, rectum, and CTV to the daily MRI. The training was performed either with true planning-fraction image pairs or with planning images and their counterparts deformed by known DDFs. The BMs were trained on 53 planning images, while to generate PSMs, the BMs were fine-tuned using the planning image of a given single patient. The evaluation included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the average (HD\n",
      "The DDFMs with DSCs for bladder/rectum of 0.76/0.76 performed worse than PSMs (0.91/0.90) and BMs (0.89/0.88). The same trend was observed for HDs. For CTV, DDFM and PSM performed similarly yielding DSCs of 0.87 and 0.84, respectively.\n",
      "DDFMs were found suitable for CTV delineation after rigid alignment. However, for OARs they were outperformed by PSMs, as they predicted only limited deformations even in the presence of substantial anatomical changes.\n",
      "Antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) report was important for rational antimicrobial use. However, the reference value of AST report was sometimes limited due to poor information quality (IQ). This study aimed to measure the IQ of AST and evaluate the impact of IQ of AST report on rational antimicrobial use as a reference for antimicrobial therapy.\n",
      "The retrospective study included data of AST report, antimicrobials prescribed after reporting AST results and related inpatient information. The inclusion criteria of the AST report included three conditions: 1. The AST reports were from inpatients with diagnosis of infection. 2. The bacteria were extracted from a sterile-site specimen. 3. The interpretive categories (ie sensitive, intermediary or resistance) were firstly reported during one hospitalization. The IQ of AST report was measured by the total IQ and IQ of completeness, usefulness, accuracy and consistency. The rational antimicrobial use was measured by the antimicrobial adherence to the interpretive categories of AST report. Fractional logit regression model (FLRM) was chosen to evaluate the impact of IQ on the rational antimicrobial use.\n",
      "The median of the total IQ, completeness, usefulness, accuracy and consistency were 0.7345, 0.6082, 0.9167, 0.8966 and 1.0000, respectively. The results of FLRM showed that usefulness, accuracy and consistency had significant positive impacts on the rational antimicrobial use (\n",

      "Observational studies have demonstrated an association between primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and thyroid dysfunction (TD). However, the causal relationship between PSC and TD remains uncertain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the causal associations and specific direction between these two conditions. Gaining insight into the potential causal relationship between PSC and TD is valuable for elucidating the pathogenesis of PSC and for devising innovative approaches for the prevention and treatment of PSC and its associated complications.\n",
      "We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal association between PSC and TD, such as autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), thyroid cancer (TC), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), among others. PSC was the exposure variable, while TD was the outcome variable. To identify suitable instrumental variables (IVs), we utilized genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets to select potential candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The primary statistical approach employed was the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, which was complemented by a series of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results by estimating heterogeneity and pleiotropy.\n",
      "We found that the causal associations between genetically predicted PSC and Graves' disease (GD), hyperthyroidism (IVW OR=1.230, 95%CI: 1.089-1.389, P=0.001; IVW OR=1.001, 95%CI: 1.000-1.002, P=0.000) were statistically significant. The reverse MR analysis indicated that genetic susceptibility to hyperthyroidism (P=0.000) and hypothyroidism (p=0.028) might be the risk of PSC. There was no statistically significant causal association observed between PSC and other TD (IVW P>0.05), with the exception of GD, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism as determined through bidirectional two-sample analysis. To ensure the reliability of our findings, additional sensitivity analyses were conducted, including the leave-one-out (LOO) test, heterogeneity test, and pleiotropic test.\n",
      "In this study, we conducted an investigation into the causal association between PSC and TD. Our findings indicate that PSC significantly elevates the susceptibility to GD and hyperthyroidism from a statistical perspective. These results shed light on the etiology of PSC and have implications for the management of patients with PSC.\n",

      "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous breast tumor type that is highly malignant, invasive, and highly recurrent. Ferroptosis is a unique mode of programmed cell death (PCD) at the morphological, physiological, and molecular levels, mainly characterized by cell death induced by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides, which plays a substantial role in a variety of diseases, including tumors and inflammatory diseases. TNBC cells have been reported to display a peculiar equilibrium metabolic profile of iron and glutathione, which may increase the sensitivity of TNBC to ferroptosis. TNBC possesses a higher sensitivity to ferroptosis than other breast cancer types. Ferroptosis also occurred between immune cells and tumor cells, suggesting that regulating ferroptosis may remodel TNBC by modulating the immune response. Many ferroptosis-related genes or molecules have characteristic expression patterns and are expected to be diagnostic targets for TNBC. Besides, therapeutic strategies based on ferroptosis, including the isolation and extraction of natural drugs and the use of ferroptosis inducers, are urgent for TNBC personalized treatment. Thus, this review will explore the contribution of ferroptosis in TNBC progression, diagnosis, and treatment, to provide novel perspectives and therapeutic strategies for TNBC management.\n",
      "Glioblastoma is an aggressive primary brain tumor that has seen few advances in treatments for over 20 years. In response to this desperate clinical need, multiple immunotherapy strategies are under development, including CAR-T cells, immune checkpoint inhibitors, oncolytic viruses and dendritic cell vaccines, although these approaches are yet to yield significant clinical benefit. Potential reasons for the lack of success so far include the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, the blood-brain barrier, and systemic changes to the immune system driven by both the tumor and its treatment. Furthermore, while T cells are essential effector cells for tumor control, dendritic cells play an equally important role in T cell activation, and emerging evidence suggests the dendritic cell compartment may be deeply compromised in glioblastoma patients. In this review, we describe the immunotherapy approaches currently under development for glioblastoma and the challenges faced, with a particular emphasis on the critical role of the dendritic cell-T cell axis. We suggest a number of strategies that could be used to boost dendritic cell number and function and propose that the use of these in combination with T cell-targeting strategies could lead to successful tumor control.\n",
      "Interleukin-37 (IL-37) is a newly discovered member of IL-1 family. The cytokine was proved to have extensive protective effects in infectious diseases, allergic diseases, metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases and tumors since its discovery. IL-37 was mainly produced by immune and some non-immune cells in response to inflammatory stimulus. The IL-37 precursors can convert into the mature forms after caspase-1 cleavage and activation intracellularly, and then bind to Smad-3 and transfer to the nucleus to inhibit the production and functions of proinflammatory cytokines; extracellularly, IL-37 binds to cell surface receptors to form IL-37/IL-18Rα/IL-1R8 complex to exert immunosuppressive function via inhibiting/activating multiple signal pathways. In addition, IL-37 can attenuate the pro-inflammatory effect of IL-18 through directly or forming an IL-37/IL-18BP/IL-18Rβ complex. Therefore, IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immunity of the host, and effectively control inflammatory stimulation, which was considered as a new hallmark of cancer. Specifically, it is concluded that IL-37 can inhibit the growth and migration of tumor cells, prohibit angiogenesis and mediate the immunoregulation in tumor microenvironment, so as to exert effective anti-tumor effects. Importantly, latest studies also showed that IL-37 may be a novel therapeutic target for cancer monitoring. In this review, we summarize the immunoregulation roles and mechanisms of IL-37 in anti-tumor process, and discuss its progress so far and potential as tumor immunotherapy.\n",
      "OAS1(2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1) is a member of the Interferon-Stimulated Genes which plays an important role in the antiviral process. In recent years, the role of OAS1 in tumors has attracted attention, and it was found to be associated with prognosis in several tumors. However, the mechanism by which OAS1 affects tumors is unclear and pan-cancer study of OAS1 is necessary to better understand its implication in cancers.\n",
      "The expression, prognostic value, genetic alteration, alternative splicing events of OAS1 in pan-cancers were analyzed using TCGA, GTEx, HPA, GEPIA and OncoSplicing databases. OAS1 associated immune cell infiltration was evaluated using the ESTIMATE, xCell, CIBERSORT and QUANTISEQ algorithm. Single cell transcriptome data download using TISH database. Finally, the roles of the OAS1 on apoptosis, migration and invasion were investigated in two pancreatic cancer cells.\n",
      "Our results revealed significant differences in OAS1 expression among various tumors, which had prognostic implications. In addition, we investigated the impact of OAS1 on genomic stability, methylation status, and other factors across different types of cancer, and the effects of these factors on prognosis. Notably, our study also demonstrated that OAS1 overexpression can contribute to CTL dysfunction and macrophage M2 polarization. In addition, cell experiments showed that the knockdown of OAS1 could reduce the invasive ability and increased the apoptosis rate of PAAD cells.\n",
      "These results confirmed that OAS1 could be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for its potential role in CTL dysfunction and macrophage M2 polarization.\n",
      "In the setting of viral challenge, natural killer (NK) cells play an important role as an early immune responder against infection. During this response, significant changes in the NK cell population occur, particularly in terms of their frequency, location, and subtype prevalence. In this review, changes in the NK cell repertoire associated with several pathogenic viral infections are summarized, with a particular focus placed on changes that contribute to NK cell dysregulation in these settings. This dysregulation, in turn, can contribute to host pathology either by causing NK cells to be hyperresponsive or hyporesponsive. Hyperresponsive NK cells mediate significant host cell death and contribute to generating a hyperinflammatory environment. Hyporesponsive NK cell populations shift toward exhaustion and often fail to limit viral pathogenesis, possibly enabling viral persistence. Several emerging therapeutic approaches aimed at addressing NK cell dysregulation have arisen in the last three decades in the setting of cancer and may prove to hold promise in treating viral diseases. However, the application of such therapeutics to treat viral infections remains critically underexplored. This review briefly explores several therapeutic approaches, including the administration of TGF-β inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive NK cell therapies, CAR NK cells, and NK cell engagers among other therapeutics.\n",
      "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant remains the most effective strategy for patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Leukemia-specific neoantigens presented by the major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) are recognized by the T cell receptors (TCR) triggering the graft-versus-leukemia effect. A unique TCR signature is generated by a complex V(D)J rearrangement process to form TCR capable of binding to the peptide-MHC. The generated TCR repertoire undergoes dynamic changes with disease progression and treatment.\n",
      "Here we applied two different computational tools (TRUST4 and MIXCR) to extract the TCR sequences from RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and examine the association between features of the TCR repertoire in adult patients with AML and their clinical and molecular characteristics.\n",
      "We found that only ~30% of identified TCR CDR3s were shared by the two computational tools. Yet, patterns of TCR associations with patients' clinical and molecular characteristics based on data obtained from either tool were similar. The numbers of unique TCR clones were highly correlated with patients' white blood cell counts, bone marrow blast percentage, and peripheral blood blast percentage. Multivariable regressions of TCRA and TCRB median normalized number of unique clones with mutational status of AML patients using TRUST4 showed significant association of TCRA or TCRB with WT1 mutations, WBC count, %BM blast, and sex (adjusted in TCRB model). We observed a correlation between TCRA/B number of unique clones and the expression of T cells inhibitory signal genes (\n",
      "Benchmarking of computational tools is needed to increase the accuracy of the identified clones. The utilization of RNA-seq data enables identification of highly abundant TCRs and correlating these clones with patients' clinical and molecular characteristics. This study further supports the value of high-resolution TCR-Seq analyses to characterize the TCR repertoire in patients.\n",
      "Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows poor prognosis. Combined hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and lenvatinib and PD-1 antibody therapy show promising effects in treating advanced HCC, and salvage hepatectomy further promotes the overall survival in patients who were successfully converted after combined therapy. However, salvage major hepatectomy is not always amenable due to insufficient future liver remnant volume (FLV).\n",
      "We report the case of a 59-year-old man with a huge HCC as well as multiple intrahepatic foci and portal vein tumor thrombosis at his right hemi-liver. Genomic and pathologic analyses of HCC tissue revealed a TMB-high, TPS, and CPS-high cancer, with mutated DNA damage repair gene FANCC. These results suggested that this patient may benefit from chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Thus, he received combined HAIC, lenvatinib, and PD-1 antibody treatment and showed a quick and durable response. After successful downstaging, this patient was evaluated as not suitable for salvage hepatectomy due to the low FLV. He then received simultaneous transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and portal vein embolization (PVE). The FLV increased to meet the criteria of salvage hepatectomy. Finally, this patient underwent right hemi-hepatectomy without any severe perioperative complications. In addition, no tumor recurrence occurred during the 9-month follow-up period after surgery.\n",
      "Combined HAIC, lenvatinib, and PD-1 antibody therapy, followed by simultaneous TACE and PVE, is a safe and effective conversion therapy that promotes tumor necrosis and increase FLV in patients with advanced HCC.\n",
      "Regular and moderate exercise is being used for therapeutic purposes in treating several diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, and even chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Conversely, extenuating physical exercise has long been pointed out as one of the sources of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to its severe impact on the body's physiology. AKI development is associated with increased tubular necrosis, which initiates a cascade of inflammatory responses. The latter involves cytokine production, immune cell (macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils, among others) activation, and increased oxidative stress. AKI can induce prolonged fibrosis stimulation, leading to CKD development. The need for therapeutic alternative treatments for AKI is still a relevant issue. In this context arises the question as to whether moderate, not extenuating, exercise could, on some level, prevent AKI. Several studies have shown that moderate exercise can help reduce tissue damage and increase the functional recovery of the kidneys after an acute injury. In particular, the immune system can be modulated by exercise, leading to a better recovery from different pathologies. In this review, we aimed to explore the role of exercise not as a trigger of AKI, but as a modulator of the inflammatory/immune system in the prevention or recovery from AKI in different scenarios. In AKI induced by ischemia and reperfusion, sepsis, diabetes, antibiotics, or chemotherapy, regular and/or moderate exercise could modulate the immune system toward a more regulatory immune response, presenting, in general, an anti-inflammatory profile. Exercise was shown to diminish oxidative stress, inflammatory markers (caspase-3, lactate dehydrogenase, and nitric oxide), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)), modulate lymphocytes to an immune suppressive phenotype, and decrease tumor necrosis factor-β (TGF-β), a cytokine associated with fibrosis development. Thus, it creates an AKI recovery environment with less tissue damage, hypoxia, apoptosis, or fibrosis. In conclusion, the practice of regular moderate physical exercise has an impact on the immune system, favoring a regulatory and anti-inflammatory profile that prevents the occurrence of AKI and/or assists in the recovery from AKI. Moderate exercise should be considered for patients with AKI as a complementary therapy.\n",
      "Coagulation is critically involved in the tumor microenvironment, cancer progression, and prognosis assessment. Nevertheless, the roles of coagulation-related long noncoding RNAs (CRLs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. In this study, an integrated computational framework was constructed to develop a novel coagulation-related lncRNA signature (CRLncSig) to stratify the prognosis of CRC patients, predict response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy in CRC, and explore the potential molecular mechanism.\n",
      "CRC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used as the training set, while the substantial bulk or single-cell RNA transcriptomics from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) data from CRC cell lines and paired frozen tissues were used for validation. We performed unsupervised consensus clustering of CRLs to classify patients into distinct molecular subtypes. We then used stepwise regression to establish the CRLncSig risk model, which stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups. Subsequently, diversified bioinformatics algorithms were used to explore prognosis, biological pathway alteration, immune microenvironment, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity across patient subgroups. In addition, weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to construct an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competitive endogenous network. Expression levels of CRLncSig, immune checkpoints, and immunosuppressors were determined using RT-qPCR.\n",
      "We identified two coagulation subclusters and constructed a risk score model using CRLncSig in CRC, where the patients in cluster 2 and the low-risk group had a better prognosis. The cluster and CRLncSig were confirmed as the independent risk factors, and a CRLncSig-based nomogram exhibited a robust prognostic performance. Notably, the cluster and CRLncSig were identified as the indicators of immune cell infiltration, immunoreactivity phenotype, and immunotherapy efficiency. In addition, we identified a new endogenous network of competing CRLs with microRNA/mRNA, which will provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies of CRLs in the malignant progression of CRC. Moreover, CRLncSig strongly correlated with drug susceptibility.\n",
      "We developed a reliable CRLncSig to predict the prognosis, immune landscape, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity in patients with CRC, which might facilitate optimizing risk stratification, guiding the applications of immunotherapy, and individualized treatments for CRC.\n",
      "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains difficult to treat, especially due to ineffective immune responses. Current treatments mainly aim at a cytotoxic effect, whereas (stem) cell therapies are being investigated for their immune stimulatory capacities to initiate the anti-tumor immunity. Here, a thoroughly characterized, homogenous and non-tumorigenic mixture of equine mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) harvested from horse peripheral blood as innovative xenogeneic immunomodulators were tested in a 4T1-based intraductal mouse model for TNBC. The eMSCs significantly reduced 4T1 progression upon systemic injection, with induction of inflammatory mediators and T-cell influx in primary tumors, already after a single dose. These xenogeneic anti-cancer effects were not restricted to MSCs as systemic treatment with alternative equine epithelial stem cells (eEpSCs) mimicked the reported disease reduction. Mechanistically, effective eMSC treatment did not rely on the spleen as systemic entrapment site, whereas CD4\n",
      "Naïve T cells remain in an actively maintained state of quiescence until activation by antigenic signals, upon which they start to proliferate and generate effector cells to initiate a functional immune response. Metabolic reprogramming is essential to meet the biosynthetic demands of the differentiation process, and failure to do so can promote the development of hypofunctional exhausted T cells.\n",
      "Here we used 13C metabolomics and transcriptomics to study the metabolism of CD8+ T cells in their complete course of differentiation from naïve over stem-like memory to effector cells and in exhaustion-inducing conditions.\n",
      "The quiescence of naïve T cells was evident in a profound suppression of glucose oxidation and a decreased expression of ENO1, downstream of which no glycolytic flux was detectable. Moreover, TCA cycle activity was low in naïve T cells and associated with a downregulation of SDH subunits. Upon stimulation and exit from quiescence, the initiation of cell growth and proliferation was accompanied by differential expression of metabolic enzymes and metabolic reprogramming towards aerobic glycolysis with high rates of nutrient uptake, respiration and lactate production. High flux in anabolic pathways imposed a strain on NADH homeostasis, which coincided with engagement of the proline cycle for mitochondrial redox shuttling. With acquisition of effector functions, cells increasingly relied on glycolysis as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation, which was, however, not linked to changes in mitochondrial abundance. In exhaustion, decreased effector function concurred with a reduction in mitochondrial metabolism, glycolysis and amino acid import, and an upregulation of quiescence-associated genes, TXNIP and KLF2, and the T cell suppressive metabolites succinate and itaconate.\n",
      "Overall, these results identify multiple metabolic features that regulate quiescence, proliferation and effector function, but also exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during differentiation.

      "Folate receptor delta (FRδ) has been used as a biomarker for regulatory T cells (Tregs), because its expression is limited to Tregs and ovum. Although FRδ is unable to bind folate, we have used molecular docking software to identify a folate congener that binds FRδ with high affinity and have exploited this FRδ-specific ligand to target attached drugs (imaging agents, immune activators, and immune suppressors) specifically to Tregs in murine tumor xenografts. Analysis of treated tumors demonstrates that targeting of a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist inhibits Treg expression of FOXP3, PD-1, CTLA4, and HELIOS, resulting in 40-80% reduction in tumor growth and repolarization of other tumor-infiltrating immune cells to more inflammatory phenotypes. Targeting of the immunosuppressive drug dexamethasone, in contrast, promotes enhanced tumor growth and shifts the tumor-infiltrating immune cells to more anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Since Tregs comprise <1% of cells in the tumor masses examined, and since the targeted drugs are not internalized by cancer cells, these data demonstrate that Tregs exert a disproportionately large effect on tumor growth. Because the targeted drug did not bind to Tregs or other immune cells in healthy tissues, the data demonstrate that the immunosuppressive properties of Tregs in tumors can be manipulated without causing systemic toxicities associated with global reprogramming of the immune system.\n",

Its aberrant expression intricately regulates a wide spectrum of cellular processes, spanning from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, migration, metastasis, and stemness to drug resistance. SOX21-AS1 achieves these effects through its involvement in the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, modulation of downstream genes, and regulation of critical pathways, including PI3K/AKT, Hippo, Wnt/β-catenin, and ERK signaling. Of significant clinical relevance, SOX21-AS1 expression has shown robust correlations with various clinical-pathological features. Moreover, it has demonstrated promising prognostic and diagnostic potential across a spectrum of tumors, as evidenced by existing literature and TCGA pan-cancer analyses. In Alzheimer's disease, SOX21-AS1 assumes a distinctive role. It influences neuronal viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress by interacting with miR-107 and miR-132, and affecting the PI3K/AKT and Wnt signaling pathways. This comprehensive review sheds light on the functions of SOX21-AS1 and the regulated mechanisms underpinning its impact on neoplastic conditions and Alzheimer's disease.

However, little is known about the expression and prognostic significance of CCT8 (subunit 8 of the CCT complex chaperonin) in lung cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that CCT8 expression is frequently increased in human lung cancer. Survival analysis indicated that CCT8 expression is closely correlated with inferior overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), but not in lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC). Subsequently, ectopic expression of CCT8 facilitated cell migration and tumor metastasis, and vice versa. Mechanistically, CCT8 interacted and activated ATK. Inhibition of AKT suppressed CCT8-induced cell migration and tumor metastasis. Our findings support CCT8 as a biomarker for LUAD prognosis and as a target for LUAD therapy.\n",

Although the regulatory role of the spindle microtubule assembly factor (ASPM) in tumor progression has been established, its relationship to the development of RCC remains unclear. To determine the significance of this gene in RCC, we examined its expression in RCC patients in the TCGA database and compared ASPM level between clinical samples of normal tissues and RCC tissues collected at our center. The prognostic relevance of ASPM was assessed by generating Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank functions. Following alteration of ASPM expression using sh-ASPM or oe-ASPM transfection, RCC cell characteristics were evaluated through CCK-8, Transwell, and colony formation assays. Western blot analysis was conducted to measure levels of genes affected by ASPM, and rescue experiments were performed to explore the involvement of Wnt3a signaling in ASPM-mediated malignancy in RCC. Our findings indicate that ASPM is upregulated in RCC samples, and its levels are associated with the long-term survival of RCC patients. ASPM promotes the migration, proliferation, and invasiveness of RCC cells, and the Wnt3a pathway may be implicated in this process. In conclusion, these results indicate that ASPM contributes to the cancer progression of RCC by targeting the Wnt3a signaling pathway.\n",

This is the first RBEL1A critical review covering its discovery, biochemistry, physiological functions, and clinical insights. RBEL1A expression at the appropriate levels appears essential in normal cells and tissues to maintain chromosomal stability; however, its overexpression is linked to tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the upstream and downstream targets of the RBEL1A signaling pathways will be discussed. Mechanistically, RBEL1A promotes cell proliferation signals by enhancing the Erk1/2, Akt, c-Myc, and CDK pathways while blunting the apoptotic signals via inhibitions on p53, Rb, and caspase pathways. More importantly, this review covers the clinical relevance of RBEL1A in the cancer field, such as drug resistance and poor overall survival rate. Also, this review points out the bottle-necks of the RBEL1A research and its future research directions.

      "Scientists have used pharmacological inhibitors of polycomb proteins to restore the expression of tumor suppressor genes and stop cancer proliferation and invasion. A major limitation of this approach is that key transcriptional activators, such as TP53 and BAF SWI/SNF, are often mutated in cancer. Poor clinical results for polycomb-targeting therapies in solid cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), could discourage the further development of epigenetic monotherapies. Here, we performed epigenome actuation with a synthetic reader-actuator (SRA) that binds trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 in polycomb chromatin and modulates core transcriptional activators. In SRA-expressing TNBC BT-549 cells, 122 genes become upregulated ≥2-fold, including the genes involved in cell death, cell cycle arrest, and migration inhibition. The SRA-expressing spheroids showed reduced size in Matrigel and loss of invasion.

      "Adverse reactions in tattooed skin during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are rare but well known. Previous reports describe sudden burning pain in tattooed skin, sometimes accompanied by mild erythema and oedema when entering MRI scanners. The pathophysiology remains unclear, but simple direct thermal heating can be excluded. It has been hypothesized that MRI-triggered torque and traction create neural sensations from magnetic pigment particles. However, this case enlightens yet another possible mechanism. We present a 35-year-old woman experiencing reoccurring stinging sensations in three decorative black tattoos just seconds after the initiation of the MRI. Single-blind tests with handheld power magnets or a dummy could reproduce painful subjective feelings in her tattooed skin. Similar events were provoked during re-evaluation with MRI. Surprisingly, chemical analyses and electron microscopy of skin samples revealed carbon black as the colouring agent - no iron-based solids were detected. Our case demonstrates that MRI tattoo reactions are not limited to magnetic contaminants alone. More distinct subgroups of MRI-induced reactions may occur. We hypothesize that radiofrequency induction of surface currents in black carbon particles adjacent to sensory axons in the dermis may lead to neurosensations.\n",
      "Poroid hidradenoma (PH) is a rare benign adnexal tumor of eccrine differentiation. It is the rarest of the four described variants of poroid neoplasms. PHs characteristically share a hybrid of the architectural features of the hidradenoma, namely, tumor cells are entirely intradermal with both solid and cystic components, and the cytologic characteristics of the poroid neoplasms, containing predominantly poroid and cuticular cells. Many published reports of PH since its original discovery in 1990 state that \"very few\" cases of PH can be found in the literature. Here, we have identified a total of 75 published accounts of PH, including the case presented here, as well as the associated patient demographics, lesion characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. We suggest that while uncommon, PH is likely not exceptionally rare and could be an underreported diagnosis.\n",

      "Chondrosarcoma is the second most common type of bone cancer. At present, the most effective clinical course of action is surgical resection. Cisplatin is the chemotherapeutic medication most widely used for the treatment of chondrosarcoma; however, its effectiveness is severely hampered by drug resistance. In the current study, we compared cisplatin-resistant chondrosarcoma SW1353 cells with their parental cells via RNA sequencing. Our analysis revealed that glutamine metabolism is highly activated in resistant cells but glucose metabolism is not. Amphiregulin (AR), a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor, enhances glutamine metabolism and supports cisplatin resistance in human chondrosarcoma by promoting NADPH production and inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. The MEK, ERK, and NrF2 signaling pathways were shown to regulate AR-mediated alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2; also called SLC1A5) and glutaminase (GLS) expression as well as glutamine metabolism in cisplatin-resistant chondrosarcoma. The knockdown of AR expression in cisplatin-resistant chondrosarcoma cells was shown to reduce the expression of SLC1A5 and GLS \n",
      "The dysfunction of immune cell development often impairs immunological homeostasis, thus causing various human diseases. Accumulating evidence shows that the development of different immune cells from hematopoietic stem cells are highly fine-tuned by different epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and RNA-related regulations. Understanding how epigenetic regulators modulate normal development of immune cells contributes to the identification of new strategies for various diseases. Here, we review recent advances suggesting that epigenetic modulations can orchestrate immune cell development and functions through their impact on critical gene expression. We also discuss the aberrations of epigenetic modulations in immune cells that influence tumor progression, and the fact that underlying mechanisms affect how epigenetic drugs interfere with tumor progression in the clinic.\n",
      "Flotillin-1 (FLOT1) is a member of the flotillin family and serves as a hallmark of lipid rafts involved in the process of signaling transduction and vesicular trafficking. Here, we find FLOT1 promotes gastric cancer cell progression and metastasis by interacting with BCAR1, through ERK signaling. FLOT1 regulates BCAR1 phosphorylation and translocation. Overexpression of FLOT1 increases, while knockdown of FLOT1 decreases gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. BCAR1 knockdown could block FLOT1 induced gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Re-expression of wildtype rather than mutant BCAR1 (Y410F) could partially restore FLOT1 knockdown induced gastric cancer cell migration and invasion, while the restore could be inhibited by ERK inhibitor. Furthermore, FLOT1 and BCAR1 expression is closely related to gastric cancer patients' poor outcome. Thus, our findings confirm that BCAR1 mediates FLOT1 induced gastric cancer progression and metastasis through ERK signaling, which may provide a novel pathway for gastric cancer treatment.\n",
      "As a multi-substrate transmembrane protease, γ-secretase exists widely in various cells. It controls multiple important cellular activities through substrate cleavage. γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) play a role in cancer inhibition by blocking Notch cleavage, and are considered as potential therapeutic strategies for cancer. Currently, GSIs have encouraging performance in preclinical models, yet this success does not translate well in clinical trials. In recent years, a number of breakthrough discoveries have shown us the promise of targeting γ-secretase for the treatment of cancer. Here, we integrate a large amount of data from γ-secretase and its inhibitors and cancer in nearly 30 years, comb and discuss the close connection between γ-secretase and cancer, as well as the potential and problems of current GSIs in cancer treatment. We analyze the possible reasons for the failure performance of current GSIs in clinical trials, and make recommendations for future research areas.\n",
      "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cells that detach from the primary tumor and enter the bloodstream, playing a crucial role in the metastasis of lung cancer. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of drugs specifically designed to target CTCs and prevent tumor metastasis. In this study, we present evidence that polyphyllin VII, a potent anticancer compound, effectively inhibits the metastasis of lung cancer by inducing a process called anoikis in CTCs. We observed that polyphyllin VII had significant cytotoxicity and inhibited colony formation, migration, and invasion in both our newly established cell line CTC-TJH-01 and a commercial lung cancer cell line H1975. Furthermore, we found that polyphyllin VII induced anoikis and downregulated the TrkB and EGFR-MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Moreover, activation of TrkB protein did not reverse the inhibitory effect of polyphyllin VII on CTCs, while upregulation of EGFR protein effectively reversed it. Furthermore, our immunodeficient mouse models recapitulated that polyphyllin VII inhibited lung metastasis, which was associated with downregulation of the EGFR protein, and reduced the number of CTCs disseminated into the lungs by inducing anoikis. Together, these results suggest that polyphyllin VII may be a promising compound for the treatment of lung cancer metastasis by targeting CTCs.\n",
      "Protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)-mediated arginine methylation is an important post-transcriptional modification that regulates various cellular processes including epigenetic gene regulation, genome stability maintenance, RNA metabolism, and stress-responsive signal transduction. The varying substrates and biological functions of arginine methylation in cancer and neurological diseases have been extensively discussed, providing a rationale for targeting PRMTs in clinical applications. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated an interplay between arginine methylation and viral infections. PRMTs have been found to methylate and regulate several host cell proteins and different functional types of viral proteins, such as viral capsids, mRNA exporters, transcription factors, and latency regulators. This modulation affects their activity, subcellular localization, protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions, ultimately impacting their roles in various virus-associated processes. In this review, we discuss the classification, structure, and regulation of PRMTs and their pleiotropic biological functions through the methylation of histones and non-histones. Additionally, we summarize the broad spectrum of PRMT substrates and explore their intricate effects on various viral infection processes and antiviral innate immunity. Thus, comprehending the regulation of arginine methylation provides a critical foundation for understanding the pathogenesis of viral diseases and uncovering opportunities for antiviral therapy.\n",

Despite this, effective pharmacological treatments for ALD remain elusive, and the core mechanisms underlying the disease are not yet fully comprehended. S100A16, a newly identified calcium-binding protein, is linked to lipid metabolism. Our research has discovered elevated levels of the S100A16 protein in both serum and liver tissue of ALD patients. A similar surge in hepatic S100A16 expression was noted in a Gao-binge alcohol feeding mouse model. \n",
      "Periodontitis is a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease with an exaggerated host immune response, resulting in periodontal tissue destruction and potential tooth loss. The long non-coding RNA, LncR-ANRIL, located on human chromosome 9p21, is recognized as a genetic risk factor for various conditions, including atherosclerosis, periodontitis, diabetes, and cancer. LncR-APDC is an ortholog of ANRIL located on mouse genome chr4. This study aims to comprehend the regulatory role of lncR-APDC in periodontitis progression. Our experimental findings, obtained from lncR-APDC gene knockout (KO) mice with induced experimental periodontitis (EP), revealed exacerbated bone loss and disrupted pro-inflammatory cytokine regulation. Downregulation of osteogenic differentiation occurred in bone marrow stem cells harvested from lncR-APDC-KO mice. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing of periodontitis gingival tissue revealed alterations in the proportion and function of immune cells, including T and B cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, due to lncR-APDC silencing.

      "Early gastric cancer is defined as gastric cancer confined to the mucosa or submucosa, irrespective of lymph node metastasis. Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a standard treatment of early gastric cancer. The nonextension sign consists of a protrusion of the surrounding mucosa into the lumen, resembling a trapezoidal shape. This phenomenon occurs when massive submucosal invasion by a cancer increases the thickness and rigidity of the gastric wall and may be useful to differentiate between mucosal or microinvasive submucosal and invasive submucosal cancers. Our case demonstrates the usefulness of the absence of the conventional endoscopic nonextension sign as a marker to decide the adequate approach for mucosal lesions.\n",

      "The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become the dominant strain worldwide due to its high transmissibility, although it appears to be less pathogenic than previous strains. However, individuals with hematological malignancy (HM) and COVID-19 remain susceptible to severe infection and mortality, especially those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and those undergoing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatment. Hematologists should thoroughly assess the severity of the patient's hematological disease and the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection before initiating chemotherapy or immunosuppressive treatment. Vaccination and booster doses are strongly recommended and patients with a poor vaccine response may benefit from long-acting COVID-19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (such as Evusheld). Early use of small molecule antiviral drugs is recommended for managing mild COVID-19 in HM patients and those with severe immunodeficiency may benefit from SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy and high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). For moderate to severe cases, low-dose glucocorticoids in combination with early antiviral treatment can be administered, with cytokine receptor antagonists or JAK inhibitors added if the condition persists or worsens. In the treatment of hematological malignancies, delaying chemotherapy is preferable for CLL, acute leukemia (AL), and low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but if the disease progresses, appropriate adjustments in dosage and frequency of treatment are required, with the avoidance of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, CAR-T and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) can continue current treatment. What's more, non-drug protective measures, the development of new vaccines and antiviral drugs, and monitoring of mutations in immunocompromised populations are particularly important.\n",

      "Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, the formation of new blood or lymphatic vessels, respectively, from preexisting vasculature is essential during embryonic development, but also occurs during tissue repair and in pathological conditions (cancer; ocular disease; ischemic, infectious and inflammatory disorders), which are all characterized to a certain extent by inflammatory conditions. Hence, a rapid, inexpensive, feasible / technically easy, reliable assay of inflammation-induced (lymph-)angiogenesis is highly valuable. In this context, the corneal thermal cauterization assay in mice is a simple, low-cost, reproducible, insightful and labor-saving assay to gauge the role of inflammation in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no standardized protocol to perform this assay. Here, we provide a step-by-step description of the model's procedures, which include:•The thermal cauterization of the corneas,•Enucleation and dissection of the corneas,•Subsequent immunofluorescence staining of the neovasculature, and morphometric analysis. We also discuss ethical considerations and aspects related to animal welfare guidelines. Altogether, this paper will help to increase the reproducibility of the corneal thermal cauterization model and facilitate its use for angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis research.\n",

      "A literature review identified 22 sources on cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in rural and remote areas. These sources revealed similar obstacles to screening and vaccination in both high and low-income countries, such as low awareness and knowledge about CC, screening, and HPV vaccination among rural residents; limited accessibility due to remoteness and dearth of medical facilities and practitioners, associated with a decrease in recommendations from them, and financial constraints, necessitating out-of-pocket expenses. The reviewed sources analyzed strategies to mitigate the outlined challenges. Possible solutions include the introduction of tailored screening and vaccination campaigns designed for residents of rural and remote locations. New screening and vaccination sites have been proposed to overcome geographic barriers. Integrating HPV testing-based CC screening is suggested to counter the lack of healthcare personnel. HPV vaccination is essential for primary cervical cancer prevention, especially in rural and remote areas, as it requires less medical infrastructure.\n",
      "Certain measures can be proposed to improve the uptake of CC screening and HPV vaccination programs among rural residents, which are needed to address the higher prevalence of CC in rural areas. Further investigation into cervical cancer prevention in rural and remote contexts is necessary to ascertain the optimal strategies that promote health equity.\n",
      "The vertebrate retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lies adjacent to the photoreceptors and is responsible for the engulfment and degradation of shed photoreceptor outer segment fragments (POS) through receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Phagocytosis of POS is critical for maintaining photoreceptor function and is a key indicator of RPE functionality. Popular established methods to assess RPE phagocytosis rely mainly on quantifying POS proteins, especially their most abundant protein rhodopsin, or on fluorescent dye conjugation of bulk, unspecified POS components. While these approaches are practical and quantitative, they fail to assess the fate of POS lipids, which make up about 50% of POS by dry weight and whose processing is essential for life-long functionality of RPE and retina.\n",
      "We have developed a novel very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFA)-based approach for evaluating RPE phagocytic activity by primary bovine and rat RPE and the human ARPE-19 cell line and validated its results using traditional methods.\n",

      "Medical resource management can be improved by assessing the likelihood of prolonged length of stay (LOS) for head and neck cancer surgery patients. The objective of this study was to develop predictive models that could be used to determine whether a patient's LOS after cancer surgery falls within the normal range of the cohort.\n",
      "We conducted a retrospective analysis of a dataset consisting of 300 consecutive patients who underwent head and neck cancer surgery between 2017 and 2022 at a single university medical center. Prolonged LOS was defined as LOS exceeding the 75th percentile of the cohort. Feature importance analysis was performed to evaluate the most important predictors for prolonged LOS. We then constructed 7 machine learning and deep learning algorithms for the prediction modeling of prolonged LOS.\n",
      "The algorithms reached accuracy values of 75.40 (radial basis function neural network) to 97.92 (Random Trees) for the training set and 64.90 (multilayer perceptron neural network) to 84.14 (Random Trees) for the testing set. The leading parameters predicting prolonged LOS were operation time, ischemia time, the graft used, the ASA score, the intensive care stay, and the pathological stages. The results revealed that patients who had a higher number of harvested lymph nodes (LN) had a lower probability of recurrence but also a greater LOS. However, patients with prolonged LOS were also at greater risk of recurrence, particularly when fewer (LN) were extracted. Further, LOS was more strongly correlated with the overall number of extracted lymph nodes than with the number of positive lymph nodes or the ratio of positive to overall extracted lymph nodes, indicating that particularly unnecessary lymph node extraction might be associated with prolonged LOS.\n",
      "The results emphasize the need for a closer follow-up of patients who experience prolonged LOS. Prospective trials are warranted to validate the present results.\n",
      "This work intends to examine the diagnostic, prognostic, and biological roles of PSMD1 (proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 1) in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and other malignancies, using bioinformatics techniques. PSMD1 is an innate immune gene that has been identified as a biomarker for several cancers. By analyzing TCGA data, we determined that PSMD1 has excellent diagnostic and prognostic value in LIHC. We also examined its correlation with stage-matching clinical features, particularly T staging and stage staging. Independent prognostic analysis, nomogram, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) analysis confirmed the predictive ability of PSMD1 on patient clinical outcomes. Our focus was on exploring the biological process, immune infiltration, and genetic variation in which PSMD1 is involved in LIHC. We found a close relationship between PSMD1 and the tumor microenvironment (TME), as well as various immune cell infiltration, immune function, and immune checkpoints. Furthermore, our results suggested that liver cancer patients with low PSMD1 expression were more actively responsive to immunotherapy according to TIDE predictions. Additionally, we observed significant differences in patient survival based on the different immune molecular types of tumors and their correlation with PSMD1 expression. The close relationship between PSMD1 and copy number variation (CNV), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and methylation was also confirmed, showing a significant impact on patient survival. Moreover, the pan-cancer analysis revealed that PSMD1 is closely related to the diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers, as well as immune infiltration across different cancer types. In summary, PSMD1 has the potential to be a useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for LIHC and other types of cancers. It is closely associated with indicators such as immune infiltration, CNV, TMB, and methylation. The identification of PSMD1 may offer a potential intervention target for LIHC and various cancers.\n",

      "From June 2020 to August 2021, 109 colorectal cancer patients with a clear pathological diagnosis who had not yet undergone surgery or chemotherapy were classified according to the TCM syndrome classification, and the feces samples of 109 patients with preoperative colorectal cancer were collected. 16s rRNA gene sequencing was used to determine gut microbiota diversity and abundance in CRC patients with different TCM syndrome, and LEfSe analysis was made to screen different TCM syndrome for differential representative microbiota.\n",
      "109 patients were divided into 5 syndromes by TCM syndrome classification, which were Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency Syndrome (LKYDS, n = 19), Spleen Deficient Qi Stagnation Syndrome (SDQSS, n = 30), Stasis and Poison Obstruction Syndrome (SPOS, n = 17), Damp-Heat Syndrome (DHS, n = 30), Qi and Blood Deficiency Syndrome (QBDS, n = 13). Alpha diversity index showed significant differences among the five groups of TCM syndromes, with Shannon index being highest in the SDQSS group and lowest in the LKYDS (p = 0.003). ACE index being highest in the SDQSS group and lowest in the SPOS (p = 0.010). PD whole tree index being highest in the SDQSS group and lowest in the SPOS (p = 0.017).

      "Semantic segmentation is crucial in medical image diagnosis. Traditional deep convolutional neural networks excel in image classification and object detection but fall short in segmentation tasks. Enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of detecting high-level cervical lesions and invasive cancer poses a primary challenge in segmentation model development.\n",
      "Between 2018 and 2022, we retrospectively studied a total of 777 patients, comprising 339 patients with high-level cervical lesions and 313 patients with microinvasive or invasive cervical cancer. Overall, 1554 colposcopic images were put into the DeepLabv3+ model for learning. Accuracy, Precision, Specificity, and mIoU were employed to evaluate the performance of the model in the prediction of cervical high-level lesions and cancer.\n",
      "Experiments showed that our segmentation model had better diagnosis efficiency than colposcopic experts and other artificial intelligence models, and reached Accuracy of 93.29 %, Precision of 87.2 %, Specificity of 90.1 %, and mIoU of 80.27 %, respectively.\n",
      "The DeepLabv3+ model had good performance in the segmentation of cervical lesions in colposcopic post-acetic-acid images and can better assist colposcopists in improving the diagnosis.\n",
      "The health-care industry is in a state of constant flux, with new challenges and opportunities emerging regularly. Hospitals, as the cornerstone of health-care delivery, must adapt and embrace change to provide optimal patient care. One crucial aspect that plays a significant role in the success of hospitals is sustainable learning. Sustainable learning refers to acquiring knowledge, skills, and competencies that enable health-care professionals to adapt to changes, implement best practices, and deliver high-quality care. Sustainable learning, a concept gaining prominence, emphasizes the ability of hospitals to learn from experiences and adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining quality health-care delivery. This article aims to investigate the role of hospital capabilities in sustainable learning and explore how hospitals can foster an environment that promotes continuous learning and development. Another goal of the paper is to test the relationships between cultural capabilities, structural capabilities, knowledge management capabilities, Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, top management support, application capabilities, and sustainable learning. The Partial Least-Squares (PLS) algorithm was performed using SmartPLS 3.0 to attain this goal. The results successfully support the study goals. This study verified that cultural capability, structural capabilities, knowledge management capabilities, IT infrastructure, top management support, and application capabilities positively affected sustainable learning. This investigation contributes to hospital, management, and education research by developing an integrated paradigm for sustainable learning. In conclusion, the new conceptual model presented here provides a robust framework for investigating the role of hospital capabilities in sustainable learning. By understanding and improving their capabilities, hospitals can not only adapt to change but also thrive in an ever-changing health-care landscape.\n",
      "Previous studies have found that β-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the main component of ketone bodies, is of physiological importance as a backup energy source during starvation or induces diabetic ketoacidosis when insulin deficiency occurs. Ketogenic diets (KD) have been used as metabolic therapy for over a hundred years, it is well known that ketone bodies and BHB not only serve as ancillary fuel substituting for glucose but also induce anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective features via binding to several target proteins, including histone deacetylase (HDAC), or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recent advances in epigenetics, especially novel histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs), have continuously updated our understanding of BHB, which also acts as a signal transduction molecule and modification substrate to regulate a series of epigenetic phenomena, such as histone acetylation, histone β-hydroxybutyrylation, histone methylation, DNA methylation, and microRNAs. These epigenetic events alter the activity of genes without changing the DNA structure and further participate in the pathogenesis of related diseases. This review focuses on the metabolic process of BHB and BHB-mediated epigenetics in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and complications of diabetes, neuropsychiatric diseases, cancers, osteoporosis, liver and kidney injury, embryonic and fetal development, and intestinal homeostasis, and discusses potential molecular mechanisms, drug targets, and application prospects.\n",
      "Lung cancer patients diagnosed following emergency admission often present with advanced disease and poor performance status, leading to suboptimal treatment options and outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and molecular characteristics, treatment initiation, and survival outcomes of these patients.\n",
      "We retrospectively analyzed data from 124 patients diagnosed with lung cancer following emergency admission at a single institution. Clinical characteristics, results of molecular analyses for therapeutic purpose, systemic treatment initiation, and survival outcomes were assessed. Correlations between patients' characteristics and treatment initiation were analyzed.\n",
      "Median age at admission was 73 years, and 79.0 % had at least one comorbidity. Most patients (87.1 %) were admitted due to cancer-related symptoms. Molecular analyses were performed in 89.5 % of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. In this subgroup, two-thirds (66.2 %) received first-line therapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 3.9 months for the entire cohort, and 2.9 months for patients with metastatic lung cancer. Among patients with advanced NSCLC, OS was significantly longer for those with actionable oncogenic drivers and those who received first-line therapy. Improvement of performance status during hospitalization resulted in increased probability of receiving first-line systemic therapy.\n",
      "Patients diagnosed with lung cancer following emergency admission demonstrated poor survival outcomes. Treatment initiation, particularly for patients with actionable oncogenic drivers, was associated with longer OS. These findings highlight the need for proactive medical approaches, including improving access to molecular diagnostics and targeted treatments, to optimize outcomes in this patient population.\n",

      "A very rare skin cancer. Malignant variant of pilomatricoma. It is unique because of its highly aggressive behavior. Responds poorly to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Treated with a wide surgical excision with safe margins.\n",
      "Pilomatrix carcinoma is uncommon and locally aggressive tumor of the hair follicle matrix. It is a malignant variant of pilomatricoma. If left untreated for a long time may attain massive size and has the potential for distant spread. Only few cases with brain extension have been reported in the literature. Diagnosis of these tumors is established by histopathology. Although pilomatrixoma and pilomatrix carcinoma are well-recognized lesions, clinically they are frequently misdiagnosed as other skin conditions. The tumors respond poorly to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Thus, recommended treatment is a wide surgical excision with safe margins. Herein, we report the case of a 39-year-old African woman with pilomatrix carcinoma of the scalp eroding the skull bone with intracranial extension.\n",
      "An uncommon form of CNS tuberculosis called non-osseous IDEM tuberculoma frequently results from paradoxical drug interactions. It should be considered one of the differentials when patients receiving ATT experience acute neurological impairment.\n",
      "Tuberculoma affecting the spinal cord is a rare condition in modern times. The occurrence of non-osseous intradural tuberculosis, specifically in the spine, is even more exceptional. In fact, it is uncommon to encounter an intradural extramedullary tuberculous granuloma that lacks radiological indications of vertebral involvement, especially within the thoracic region. We present a case of a patient with a neurological deficit caused by a non-osseous intradural tuberculoma in the thoracic region, without any associated bone involvement. The patient experienced a gradual deterioration of neurological function. An MRI of the thoracic spine revealed the presence of a tuberculoma located intradurally, extramedullary, and juxtamedullary of the T5 vertebra. The compression of the spinal cord resulted in paraparesis which was worsening to paraplegia. A D4-D6 laminectomy and microsurgical excision were performed under intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), and the patient showed clinical recovery. Excellent clinical outcomes were achieved. However, it is crucial to consider the possibility of a non-osseous intradural tuberculoma as a rare condition when encountering a SOL, particularly in patients with a history of tuberculosis and spinal cord compression. In cases where a progressing neurological deficit is present, a combination of surgical intervention and anti-tuberculous treatment should be considered as the optimal approach.\n",
      "Female Veterans report cervical cancer risk factors at higher rates than non-Veterans. Using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we tested whether Veterans with a recent cervical cancer screening test were more likely than non-Veterans to have received an abnormal result. NHIS is a population-based cross-sectional household survey with a stratified, multistage sampling design. We pooled screening data from 2010, 2015, and 2018, and restricted the sample to female participants without a hysterectomy who had a cervical cancer screening test in the prior 3 years. The primary outcome was self-reported abnormal result on a Pap and/or HPV test in the prior 3 years. Our main predictor was Veteran status. We used survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds of an abnormal screening result in the prior 3 years as a function of Veteran status, controlling first for age and survey year, then adding sociodemographic and health factors in subsequent models. The sample included 380 Veterans and 25,102 non-Veterans (weighted total population 104.9 million). Overall, 19.0% of Veterans and 13.7% of non-Veterans reported an abnormal cervical cancer screening test result in the prior 3 years (unadjusted p = 0.03). In the adjusted regression model, the previously observed association between Veteran status and abnormal screening result was explained by differences in sociodemographic and health factors between Veterans and non-Veterans (aOR 1.21, 95%CI 0.78-1.87). Nearly 1 in 5 Veterans with a recent cervical cancer screening test received an abnormal result. Clinicians should address modifiable risk factors and provide evidence-based follow-up for abnormal results.\n",

However, not all patients receiving splanchnic neurolysis treatment will achieve satisfactory results. The aim of this study is to retrospectively analyze the predictive value of preoperative serum immune indicators (white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets) for the efficacy of splanchnic neurolysis.\n",
      "The abdominal cancer patients (pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and renal cancer) admitted to the Department of Pain Medicine, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital from January 2017 to October 2020 were collected. We evaluate the efficacy of splanchnic neurolysis by assessing the dosage of opioids and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores of patients 24 to 48 hr before and after splanchnic neurolysis. The predictive value of preoperative serum immune indicators on the efficacy of splanchnic neurolysis was analyzed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). Contract the Nomogram prediction model by R software.\n",
      "We found that Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) has statistical significance for predicting splanchnic neurolysis efficacy in digestive system tumors. MPV and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) are independent predictors and have statistical significance in predicting splanchnic neurolysis efficacy in pancreatic cancer. The combination of MPV and NLR had satisfactory predictive value in pancreatic cancer (AUC = 0.715) and the nomogram model was constructed. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between lymphocyte count and NRS score, and a positive correlation between Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and NRS score.\n",

However, using ESD for colorectal neoplastic lesions is not explicitly researched as yet. Thus, we conducted this study to determine the feasibility and safety of 0.6% SA solution for colorectal ESD.\n",
      "In this single-center, retrospective pilot study, a total of 100 cases treated with ESD using 0.6% SA as a SM injection solution for colorectal neoplasia at our institute were retrospectively reviewed to clarify the clinical feasibility and safety of 0.6% SA. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the complication rate, and the secondary endpoint was to determine the procedure time and the amount of solution used.\n",
      "Intraoperative perforation was observed in 1 case (1.0%), 2 cases (2.0%) presented with postprocedural hemorrhage, and no lethal adverse events were observed. The median ESD procedure times were 39.5 min (10-150), and the amount of solution used was less than 20 mL in 67 cases (67.0%). En-bloc resection could be achieved in 97 cases (97.0%). Although six cases underwent subsequent surgery due to the deep SM invasion (>1000 μm), there were no cases with nodal involvement, confirmed through histopathological evaluation.\n",

For the validation of this discrimination model, data from 140 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic resection followed by gastrectomy, with a diagnosis of pT1b EGC, were extracted. We applied XGBoost to develop a discrimination model for clinical and pathological variables. The performance of the discrimination model was evaluated based on the number of cases classified as true negatives for LNM, with no false negatives for LNM allowed.\n",
      "Lymph node metastasis was observed in 95 patients (25%) in the development cohort and 11 patients (8%) in the validation cohort. The discrimination model was developed to identify 27 (7%) patients with no indications for additional surgery due to the prediction of an LNM-negative status with no false negatives. In the validation cohort, 13 (9%) patients were identified as having no indications for additional surgery and no patients with LNM were classified into this group.\n",

Preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level was a prognostic factor for conversion surgery. After correcting for immortal time bias, 1-year progression-free survival rates in the conversion surgery and non-conversion surgery groups were 50.0% and 19.0%, respectively (hazard ratio 0.343, 95% confidence interval 0.286-0.843, \n",
      "Conversion surgery might be an option for the treatment of unresectable and recurrent biliary tract cancer in patients with normal preoperative CA19-9 level.\n",
      "To evaluate the feasibility and safety of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) in Japan.\n",
      "This prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II trial was conducted at five institutions. The key eligibility criteria were age ≥ 20 years, LARC within 12 cm from the anal verge, and cT3-4N0M0 or TanyN+M0 at the time of diagnosis that enabled curative resection. Preoperative short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) 5 Gy × 5 days (total 25 Gy) + CAPOX (six courses) followed by total mesorectum excision (TME) was the treatment protocol. Non-operative management (NOM) was allowed if clinical complete response (cCR) was obtained in the preoperative evaluation. The primary endpoint was the pathological complete response (pCR) rate.\n",

      "The lymph node metastasis rate in right-sided colon cancer is unknown, and the optimal central vascular ligation level remains controversial. We aimed to determine the lymph node metastasis rate and short-term results of radical surgery with extended lymph node dissection in right-sided colon cancer.\n",
      "This prospective multicenter observational study included patients with stage II/III right-sided colon cancer from five cancer hospitals. The metastasis rate of each node station was analyzed according to tumor location and main feeding artery.\n",
      "Between April 2018 and August 2021, 208 patients underwent dissection around the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and vein (SMV). In transverse colon cancer, 7.5% and 2.5% of metastases occurred around the SMV and SMA at the root of the middle colic artery (MCA), respectively; 6.7% and 6.7% at the root of the right colic artery. In caecal cancer, 1.9% of metastases occurred around the SMV and 1.9% around the SMA. In ascending colon cancer, the rate was 1.1% around the SMV. Of the tumors, 17% fed mainly by the ileocolic artery had node metastases along the middle or right colic artery, as did 66.7% fed mainly by the right colic artery and 41.2% fed by the MCA (\n",
      "Routine prophylactic extended lymphadenectomy around the SMA might not be necessary in caecum and ascending colon cancer. Dissection around the SMA may be necessary in cases of transverse colon cancer or when the feeding artery is the MCA.\n",
      "Recently, real-world data have been recognized to have a significant role for research and quality improvement worldwide. The decision on the existence or nonexistence of postoperative complications is complex in clinical practice. This multicenter validation study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of identification of patients who underwent gastrointestinal (GI) cancer surgery and extraction of postoperative complications from Japanese administrative claims data.\n",
      "We compared data extracted from both the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) and chart review of patients who underwent GI cancer surgery from April 2016 to March 2019. Using data of 658 patients at Kyoto University Hospital, we developed algorithms for the extraction of patients and postoperative complications requiring interventions, which included an invasive procedure, reoperation, mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, intensive care unit management, and in-hospital mortality. The accuracy of the algorithms was externally validated using the data of 1708 patients at two other hospitals.\n",
      "In the overall validation set, 1694 of 1708 eligible patients were correctly extracted by DPC (sensitivity 0.992 and positive predictive value 0.992). All postoperative complications requiring interventions had a sensitivity of >0.798 and a specificity of almost 1.000. The overall sensitivity and specificity of Clavien-Dindo ≥grade IIIb complications was 1.000 and 0.995, respectively.\n",
      "Patients undergoing GI cancer surgery and postoperative complications requiring interventions can be accurately identified using the real-world data. This multicenter external validation study may contribute to future research on hospital quality improvement or to a large-scale comparison study among nationwide hospitals using real-world data.\n",
      "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had resulted in either failure to provide required medical resources or delayed treatment for gastric cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the incidence of postoperative complications using a nationwide Japanese database of patients undergoing distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.\n",
      "We collected the data of patients who underwent distal gastrectomy from January 2018 to December 2021 from the National Clinical Database (NCD), a web-based surgical registration system in Japan. The number of surgical cases, the use of intensive care units, and the incidence of morbidity per month were analyzed. We also calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), defined as the ratio of the number of observed patients to the expected number of patients calculated using the risk calculator established in the NCD, for several morbidities, including pneumonia, sepsis, 30-day mortality, and surgical mortality.\n",
      "A decrease of 568 gastrectomies was observed from April 2020 to May 2020. Although the absolute number of patients admitted to intensive care units had declined since 2020, the proportion of patients admitted to the ICU did not change before and after the pandemic. Mortality and critical morbidity (such as pneumonia and sepsis) rates were not worse during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic periods per the SMR.\n",

      "Conventionally, the recommended duration of adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer had been 6 months. The IDEA Collaboration suggested that shortening capecitabin and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) adjuvant chemotherapy may be possible. S-1 and oxaliplatin (SOX) treatment is standard treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer in Japan. The aim of this study was to optimize treatment dosage and duration of adjuvant SOX in stage III colon cancer.\n",
      "This trial was as open-label multi-center randomized phase II study. Patients with stage III colon cancer were randomly assigned to 3 months or 6 months of adjuvant SOX treatment in different doses: 130 mg/m\n",
      "Eighty-two patients were assigned to the 6 months arm and 81 to the 3 months arm. The 3-year DFS was 75.0% (80% CI 67.95-80.72, \n",

      "Because the optimal treatment strategy for borderline resectable (cT3br) thoracic esophageal cancer patients remains unclear, it is of great interest whether preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for cT3br could achieve results comparable to those seen with resectable T3 cancer (cT3r). We speculated that preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) would be particularly effective in cT3br thoracic esophageal cancer patients and compared to cT3br and cT3r.\n",
      "Of 186 cT3 thoracic esophageal cancer patients treated with intended NACRT, 162 received radical esophagectomy. More than 97% were squamous cell carcinomas. Patients were partitioned into two groups according to whether invasion of adjacent organs was suspected (cT3br and cT3r). Treatment outcomes and survival were analyzed.\n",
      "Sixty-eight patients (36.6%) were classified as cT3br and 118 (63.4%) as cT3r. The cT3br group had significantly more tumors in the upper and middle mediastinum (\n",
      "Preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy appears to be a promising treatment for patients with borderline resectable thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n",
      "Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common complication after abdominal surgery. However, the risk factors for POI after laparoscopic colorectal resection are unclear. We therefore investigated the risk factors for POI after laparoscopic colorectal surgery.\n",
      "This retrospective study involved 484 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for primary colorectal cancer at Hokkaido University Hospital. We categorized the patients into a POI group (\n",

      "Our findings suggest that male sex, COPD, and a BMI of <20 kg/m\n",
      "The systemic inflammatory response following surgery as well as that of malignant disease itself is associated with a hypercoagulable state, and thromboprophylaxis is thus recommended during postoperative management of cancer patients. However, limited information is available on the prevalence of preoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and its risk factors in surgical candidates, especially those receiving operations for benign diseases.\n",
      "This is a retrospective observational study with data of all patients scheduled for elective general surgery between January 2011 and September 2020, undergoing lower extremity venous ultrasonography as preoperative screening for DVT. The prevalence of preoperative asymptomatic DVT was estimated and its associations with clinical variables were evaluated.\n",
      "Among 1512 patients included in the study, 161 (10.6%) had asymptomatic DVT before surgery. DVT prevalence was 13.7% in patients with malignant disease, while it was 8.6% in those with benign disease. The site of the thrombus was distal type in 141 (87.6%) patients, most commonly in the soleal vein. Advanced age (>70 years), female sex, and decreased hemoglobin level were significantly associated with preoperative asymptomatic DVT by multivariate analysis. The odds ratio for advanced age was the highest and rose as age increased. Malignant disease was not an independent risk factor for preoperative DVT.\n",
      "This study showed the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT to be equal in patients with and without malignant disease undergoing elective general surgery. Preoperative DVT assessment is necessary regardless of the disease indicated for surgery, especially in patients with the risk factors identified in this study.\n",
      "Treatment strategy for locally advanced gastric cancer differs worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is considered one of the promising treatment options for locally advanced gastric cancer, even in Japan, and clinical trials have been conducted or are ongoing. A consensus meeting was organized at the 77th general meeting of the Japanese Society of Gastroenterological Surgery in 2022, in which the current status and future prospects of NAC for locally advanced gastric cancer were discussed. Participants at the meeting looked forward to the results of the JCOG1509 trial, providing solid evidence regarding NAC. The optimal indications and regimens for NAC were also debated. Patients with cStage III gastric cancer are the main targets of NAC in Japan, and a doublet regimen of S-1 and oxaliplatin was preferred by the participants. However, the feasibility of a triplet regimen with S-1, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel, and that with 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel has been demonstrated, and these could become treatment options in Japan. Other points of discussion include perioperative chemotherapy to avoid peritoneal recurrence and for patients with dMMR/MSI-high tumors. The panel regarded NAC as a promising treatment option, and NAC will become the standard treatment for cStage III gastric cancer in Japan if an ongoing clinical trial successfully demonstrates its efficacy.\n",
      "Risk prediction of anastomotic leakage using anatomical and vascular factors has not been well established. This study aimed to assess the anatomical and vascular factors affecting the hemodynamics of the gastric conduit and develop a novel risk stratification system in patients undergoing esophagectomy with retrosternal reconstruction.\n",
      "This retrospective cohort study analyzed 202 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent subtotal esophagectomy with gastric tube retrosternal reconstruction between January 2008 and December 2020. Risk factors for anastomotic leakage (AL), including the anatomical index (AI) and anastomotic viability index (AVI), were evaluated using a logistic regression model.\n",
      "According to the logistic regression model, the independent risk factors for AL were preoperative body mass index ≥23.6 kg/m\n",
      "The combination of AI and AVI strongly predicted AL. Additionally, the use of AI and AVI enabled the stratification of the risk of AL in patients who underwent esophagectomy with retrosternal reconstruction.\n",
      "Due to its multiple features, including the ability to orchestrate remote communication between different tissues, the exosomes are the extracellular vesicles arousing the highest interest in the scientific community. Their size, established as an average of 30-150 nm, allows them to be easily uptaken by most cells. According to the type of cells-derived exosomes, they may carry specific biomolecular cargoes used to reprogram the cells they are interacting with. In certain circumstances, exosomes stimulate the immune response by facilitating or amplifying the release of foreign antigens-killing cells, inflammatory factors, or antibodies (immune activation). Meanwhile, in other cases, they are efficiently used by malignant elements such as cancer cells to mislead the immune recognition mechanism, carrying and transferring their cancerous cargoes to distant healthy cells, thus contributing to antigenic invasion (immune suppression). Exosome dichotomic patterns upon immune system regulation present broad advantages in immunotherapy. Its perfect comprehension, from its early biogenesis to its specific interaction with recipient cells, will promote a significant enhancement of immunotherapy employing molecular biology, nanomedicine, and nanotechnology.\n",
      "Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is a prevalent skin malignancy. It has been indicated in many studies that trihalomethanes (THMs) exposure has a strong association with tumors but has not been associated with NMSC. Our investigation aims to explore the association between THMs exposure and NMSC.\n",
      "Cross-sectional data from the 2011 to 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was collected. Poisson regression and subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the association between individual THMs components and NMSC. Fitted smoothing curves and generalized additive models were also used.\n",
      "This study involved 5,715 individuals, 98 (1.7%) of whom self-reported NMSC. After adjusting for covariates, Poisson regression showed that higher blood TBM levels were associated with an increased likelihood of NMSC (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, \n",
      "Our results implied that among adults older than 65 years old in the U.S., elevated blood TBM concentrations were positively associated with NMSC. More prospective investigations are required to validate this relationship with the early prevention of NMSC.\n",
      "COVID-19 pandemic resulted in excess mortality and changed the trends of causes of death worldwide. In this study, we investigate the all-cause and cause-specific deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022) compared to the baseline (2018-2020), considering age groups, gender, place of residence, and place of death in south Khorasan, east of Iran.\n",
      "The present ecological study was conducted using South Khorasan Province death certificate data during 2018-2022. The number of death and all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates (per 100,000 people) were calculated and compared based on age groups, place of residence, place of death, and gender before (2018-2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022). We also calculated total and cause-specific years of life lost (YLL) to death and gender-specific life expectancy at birth.\n",
      "A total of 7,766 deaths occurred from March 21, 2018, to March 20, 2020 (pre-pandemic) and 9,984 deaths from March 21, 2020, to March 20, 2022 (pandemic). The mean age at death increased by about 2 years during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mortality rate was significantly increased in the age groups 20 years and older. The most excess deaths were recorded in men, Aged more than 60 years, death at home, and the rural population. Mortality due to COVID-19 accounted for nearly 17% of deaths. The highest increase in mortality rate was observed due to endocrine and Cardiovascular diseases. Mortality rates due to the genitourinary system and Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The major causes of death during the pandemic were Cardiovascular diseases, COVID-19, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, accidents, and endocrine diseases in both sexes, in rural and urban areas. Years of life lost (YLL) increased by nearly 15.0%, which was mostly due to COVID-19, life expectancy at birth has steadily declined from 2018 to202 for both genders (from 78.4 to 75).\n",
      "In this study, we found that All-cause mortality increased by 25.5% during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in men, older adult, Rural residents, and those who died at home (outside the hospital). Considering that the most common causes of death during the COVID-19 pandemic are also non-communicable diseases. It is necessary to pay attention to non-communicable diseases even during the pandemic of a serious infectious disease like COVID-19. The years of life lost also increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is necessary to pay attention to all age groups, especially the causes of death in young people. In most developing countries, the first cause of death of these groups is accidents.\n",
      "The prognosis of high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma (NB) patients remains poor. The identification of tumor-associated markers is important for differential diagnosis, prognosis, and the development of targeted therapies. The aim of the study was to determine the expression profile of nine most common NB antigens and assess their association with clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival.\n",
      "Tumor samples from 86 patients with NB were evaluated for the expression of tumor-associated antigen (TAA) using quantitative PCR. Twenty-one patients with benign tumors and 17 healthy donors were assigned as controls.\n",
      "Overexpression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), PHOX2B, PRAME, GPC2, B7-H3, and Survivin is the most typical for NB. Positive expression of MAGEA3, MAGEA1, and NY-ESO-1 at low levels was detected in 54%, 48%, and 52%, respectively, and was not NB specific. Higher TH expression was observed in samples without MYCN-amplification, while higher expression of Survivin, PHOX2B, and GPC2 was significantly associated with the presence of 1p.36 deletion. Overexpression of TH, PHOX2B, and MAGEA1 was associated with better event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Survivin overexpression was associated with poor EFS but had no impact on OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed Survivin as independent marker for poor survival, and PHOX2B and MAGEA1 for better survival.\n",
      "High expression of TH, PHOX2B, and MAGEA1 genes are favorable prognostic factors for OS and EFS, whereas high expression of Survivin is associated with an increased risk of relapse or progression.\n",
      "High-output stomas (HOSs) are a complication that can cause dehydration or renal dysfunction and affect the quality of life of patients, causing water, sodium, and magnesium depletion with malnutrition. Preoperative factors that are useful for predicting HOS are not well defined.\n",
      "A total of nine patients developed HOS among 31 patients who underwent rectal cancer surgery with ileostomies during 2014-2021. Clinicopathological and surgical parameters were also analyzed. HOS was defined as maximum output of ≥2,000 ml/day.\n",
      "The clinicopathological features did not differ between the HOS and non-HOS groups. Lower Hemoglobin (Hb) levels (<12 mg/dl) and longer operation times (≥300 min) were shown to be risk factors in the development of HOS.\n",
      "Low Hb levels on preoperative blood tests were predictors of HOS development in patients who underwent rectal cancer surgery and ileostomies simultaneously in our data set. Further studies are required to improve the robustness of these findings.\n",
      "Methionine restriction by diet and recombinant methioninase (rMETase) are effective for cancer therapy by themselves or combined with chemotherapy drugs. We previously showed that oral administration of rMETase-producing Escherichia coli JM109 (E. coli JM109-rMETase) can be installed in the mouse microbiome and inhibit colon-cancer growth in a syngeneic mouse model. In the present report, we investigated the efficacy of oral administration of E. coli JM109-rMETase in an orthotopic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell-line mouse model.\n",
      "First, we established orthotopic 4T1 mouse triple-negative breast cancer on an abdominal mammary gland in female athymic nu/nu nude mice aged 4-6 weeks. After tumor growth, 15 mice were divided into three groups of 5. Group 1 was administered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) orally by gavage twice daily as a control; Group 2 was administered non-recombinant E. coli JM109 competent cells orally by gavage twice daily as a control; Group 3 was administered E. coli JM109-rMETase cells by gavage twice daily for two weeks. Tumor size was measured with calipers twice per week. On day 15, blood methionine level was examined using an HPLC method.\n",
      "Oral administration of E. coli JM109-rMETase inhibited 4T1 TNBC growth significantly compared to the PBS and E. coli JM109 control groups. On day 15, the blood methionine level was significantly lower in the mice administered E. coli JM109-rMETase than in the PBS control.\n",
      "E. coli JM109-rMETase lowered blood methionine levels and inhibited TNBC growth in an orthotopic cell-line mouse model, suggesting future clinical potential against a highly recalcitrant cancer.\n",
      "In radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the therapeutic effect depends on the appropriate position of the electrode. To improve the accuracy of the electrode needle position, we currently perform RFA with combined ultrasound sonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) guidance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this US/CT-guided RFA method.\n",
      "This retrospective study recruited 97 patients with single tumors treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and monopolar RFA between January 2013 and December 2017. Among these, 50 patients were treated with RFA under US/CT guidance (US/CT-guided group) and 47 were treated with RFA under US guidance alone (US-guided group). We analyzed the efficacy of US/CT guidance compared with US guidance alone.\n",
      "The 1-, 2-, and 3-year local recurrence rates for the US/CT-guided and US-guided groups were 4.1%, 6.3%, and 8.6%, and 19.6%, 31.6%, and 41.9%, respectively. The local recurrence rate was lower in the US/CT-guided group (p=0.0030). Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis demonstrated that the independent risk factors associated with local recurrence were tumor size (p=0.0028) and US/CT guidance (p=0.0037).\n",

      "The number of older patients with breast cancer has been increasing and a major challenge is to develop optimal treatment strategies for these patients, who often have comorbidities. Obesity is reportedly a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer, however there is limited research on underweight patients. Clarifying the relationship between physique and prognosis may contribute to the establishment of optimal treatment strategies for older patients with breast cancer.\n",
      "This retrospective study examined clinicopathological data from a multicenter collaborative database on 1,076 patients aged 70 years or older who had undergone curative surgery. According to the body mass index (BMI), patient physique was defined as underweight (<18.5 kg/m\n",
      "Underweight patients had a significantly lower rate of chemotherapy administration (p=0.017) and a higher rate of presence of other cancer (p=0.022). During the observation period (median of 75.2 months), 133 patients (12%) developed recurrent disease and 131 patients (12%) died. Age, BMI, tumor size, progesterone receptor and the presence of other cancer were independent factors relating to overall survival (p<0.001, p=0.027, p=0.002, p=0.008 and p=0.005, respectively). Patients with a low BMI had a significantly shorter overall survival, but there was no association with disease-free survival in this subset of patients.\n",
      "Overall survival was shorter in underweight older patients with breast cancer. Our data indicate that being underweight should be considered both in treatment decisions and in future studies of outcomes for older patients with breast cancer.\n",
      "Staging for breast cancer in advanced stages or prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended to be performed with CT scan of the chest and abdomen and a bone scan. This recommendation is valid since 2012, when conventional staging with chest x-ray and ultrasound of the abdomen was replaced by the more sensitive CT scan. However, it remains unclear if this approach improves patient outcome and prognosis.\n",
      "We identified patients who were treated for breast cancer at the breast center of the St. Elisabeth Hospital, Cologne, in 2012 and 2014. Clinical information such as age at diagnosis, stage, tumor biology, grading, and the applied method for staging was abstracted from the patient chart. We also looked for local or distant recurrence and data of survival.\n",
      "A total of 1,122 patients were identified. Of those, 104 patients developed local or distant recurrence and 54 died. Conventional staging with chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound and a bone scan was more often in 2012 (482 cases) than in 2014 (135), but CT-staging was more often in 2014 (180 vs. 29 cases). In general, less patients were staged in 2014 than in 2012. There were no significant survival differences between the two groups.\n",
      "Staging habits changed in 2012 compared to 2014 according to the changes in guidelines. This change did not affect disease-free survival.\n",
      "Tumors and cysts with odontogenic origin represent a family of lesions with specific histo-genetic and clinical characteristics. Among them, ameloblastomas are common benign neoplasms, predominantly detected in the anatomic areas of the jaws and also in the mandible and maxilla. Although they are characterized by a slow and stable growing pattern, a subset of them shows a tendency for local tissue invasiveness and partially increased recurrence rates after surgical excision. Furthermore, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are potentially implicated in ameloblastoma onset and progression. HSPs regulate the folding and refolding of proteins and are induced in response to oxidative stress. They are crucial members of the chaperone intracellular system and are categorized based on their molecular weight (i.e., HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90). In the current review, we describe HSPs origin and function, focusing on their deregulation mechanisms and impact predominantly on ameloblastomas and also on inflammatory and developmental odontogenic cystic lesions.\n",
      "The concept of frailty has been attracting attention as a comprehensive indicator of the various effects of aging, but no conclusion has been reached on how to evaluate it. The present study investigated the adverse effect of preoperative frailty on short- and long-term outcomes in patients with gastric cancer using a questionnaire about frailty.\n",
      "One hundred and twenty-five patients with pathological stage (p Stage) I/II/III who underwent radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka, Japan from April 2015 to December 2016 were enrolled in this study. The frailty index (FI) was calculated by dividing the total score of 50 questions consisting of 1 point per question by 50. The study used multiple logistic regression analysis with 5-year overall survival (OS) as the endpoint to create a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine the cut-off point for the FI. The short- and long-term outcomes of the frail and non-frail groups were then compared, and prognostic factors for OS were examined.\n",
      "Regarding the short-term outcomes, the postoperative complication rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. Regarding the 5-year OS rates of the patients with p Stages II/III, the outcomes in the frail group were significantly poorer than those in the non-frail group. In the multivariate analysis of OS, frailty was independently associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with p Stages II/III gastric cancer.\n",
      "Frailty evaluation in this study may be useful in predicting long-term prognosis in patients undergoing surgical treatment for advanced gastric cancer.\n",
      "Regorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor, targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and other oncogenic kinases. Regorafenib has efficacy in metastatic colon cancer, but has severe dose-limiting toxicities which cause patients to stop taking the drug.

      "Palliative radiotherapy is a critical component of cancer care aimed at symptom management and enhancing the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer. Balancing symptom relief and potential risks is pivotal in clinical decision-making. This study explored the 30-day mortality (30-DM) rate after palliative radiotherapy in a single-center setting to shed light on potential prognostic factors and safety considerations.\n",
      "This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent palliative radiotherapy for various indications between March 2020 and February 2023. Data were retrieved from electronic medical records and analyzed according to ethical guidelines. The primary outcome measure was 30-DM rate, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent predictors of 30-DM.\n",
      "A total of 931 palliative radiotherapy sessions were administered to 601 patients, with a median of one session per patient. The cohort had a median age of 70 years, predominantly men (58%), and featured diverse primary cancer types, with lung cancer being the most prevalent (15.8%). The 30-DM rate was 12.9%. Multivariate analysis identified Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) as the sole independent prognostic factor significantly associated with 30-DM.\n",
      "This study provides valuable insights into 30-DM rates following palliative radiotherapy. Future research should focus on prospective multicenter investigations with larger cohorts and comprehensive data collection, ultimately leading to improved risk prediction models for personalized treatment decisions in palliative radiotherapy.\n",

      "Within the study period, 267 NSCLC patients (first period: 147 patients, second period: 121 patients) were diagnosed in our hospital. The patients in the two study periods did not differ significantly in age (p=0.613), ECOG performance status (p=0.125), and clinical stage (p=0.354). Tumor size was significantly larger in the second period with a mean of 5.88 cm ± 3.02, compared to 4.24 cm ± 1.76 in the first period (p<0.001). In the standard treatment group, the median survival time was 457 days in the first period and 313 days in the second period (p=0.063). In the best supportive care group, median survival time was 122 days in the first period and 57 days in the second period (p=0.004).\n",

      "Renal neoplasms are highlighted as one of the 10 most common types of cancer. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of renal cancer, considered the seventh most common type of cancer in the Western world. The most frequently altered genes described as altered are VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, PTEN, BAP1, mTOR, TP53, TCEB1 (ELOC), SMARCA4, ARID1A, and PIK3CA. RCC therapies can be classified in three groups: monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and mTOR inhibitors. Besides, there are targeted agents to treat RCC. However, frequently patients present side effects and resistance. Even though many multidrug resistance mechanisms already have been reported to RCC, studies focused on revealing new biomarkers as well as more effective antitumor therapies with no or low side effects are very important. Some studies reported that natural products, such as honey, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), curcumin, resveratrol, and englerin A showed antitumor activity against RCC. Moreover, nanoscience is another strategy to improve RCC treatment and reduce the side effects due to the improvement in pharmacokinetics and reduction of toxicities of chemotherapies. Taking this into account, we conducted a systemic review of recent research findings on RCC hallmarks, drug resistance, and adjuvant therapies. In conclusion, a range of studies reported that RCC is characterized by high incidence and increased mortality rates because of the development of resistance to standard therapies. Given the importance of improving RCC treatment and reducing adverse effects, nanoscience and natural products can be included in therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "Cancer is a condition characterized by genomic instability and gross chromosomal aberrations. The inability of the cell to timely and efficiently complete its replication cycle before entering mitosis is one of the most common causes of DNA damage and carcinogenesis. Phosphorylation of histone 2AX (H2AX) on S139 (γH2AX) is an indispensable step in the response to DNA damage, as it is required for the assembly of repair factors at the sites of damage. γH2AX is also a marker of DNA replication stress, mainly due to fork collapse that often follows prolonged replication stalling or repair of arrested forks, which involves the generation of DNA breaks. Although the role of γH2AX in the repair of DNA breaks has been well defined, the function of γH2AX in replicative stress remains unclear. In this review, we present the recent advances in the field of replication stress, and highlight a novel function for γH2AX that is independent of its role in the response to DNA damage. We discuss studies that support a role for γΗ2ΑΧ early in the response to replicative stress, which does not involve the repair of DNA breaks. We also highlight recent data proposing that γH2AX acts as a chromatin remodeling component, implicated in the efficient resolution of stalled replication forks. Understanding the mechanism by which γH2AX enables cellular recovery after replication stress will allow identification of novel cancer biomarkers, as well as new targets for cancer therapies.\n",
      "Advanced bladder cancer (BC) is associated with an inflammatory nature and poor prognosis Inflammatory biomarkers are potential predictors in BC. We conducted a study to assess the prognostic value of the pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) in advanced bladder cancer.\n",
      "A total of 226-patients with muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) were included. Overall (OS) and progression-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used for comparison. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine NLR, PLR, and LMR association with OS.\n",
      "Our patients' median progression-free survival and OS were 12.18 and 15.54 months, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed cut-off values for our chosen inflammatory markers. The patients with high NLR or PLR had inferior median OS compared to their counterparts with lower ratios for both (NLR: 22.51 vs. 9.84 months, respectively, p≤0.001; PLR: 17.68 vs. 14.08 months, respectively, p=0.08). Meanwhile, patients with low LMR had inferior median OS compared to patients with higher LMR (LMR: 20.14 months vs. 10.55 months, respectively, p<0.001). The multivariate Cox regression analysis identified a high PLR as an independent predictive factor of worse OS (hazard ratio=2.774, 95% confidence interval=1.486-5.178, p=0.001) but not NLR or LMR.\n",

      "The study involved assessing the inhibitory effects of KL-6 on cell proliferation, clonogenic potential, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Additionally, we examined the action mechanism of KL-6 by RNA-seq and bioinformatic analysis and validated by qRT-PCR and western blot in pancreatic cancer cells.\n",
      "Our results demonstrated that KL-6 effectively inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. It induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, disrupting the cell cycle progression and promoting cell death. KL-6 also exhibited inhibitory effects on cell migration and invasion, suggesting its potential to suppress the metastatic properties of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, KL-6 modulated the expression of genes involved in various cancer-related pathways including apoptosis and ferroptosis.\n",

      "Spinal cord injury could cause irreversible neurological dysfunction by destroying the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and allowing blood cells like neutrophils and macrophages to infiltrate the spinal cord. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) found in the human umbilical cord have emerged as a potential therapeutic alternative to cell-based treatments. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying the alterations in the BSCB permeability by human umbilical cord MSC-derived sEVs (hUC-MSCs-sEVs) after SCI. First, we used hUC-MSCs-sEVs to treat SCI rat models, demonstrating their ability to inhibit BSCB permeability damage, improve neurological repair, and reduce SCI-induced upregulation of prepro-endothelin-1 (prepro-ET-1) mRNA and endothelin-1 (ET-1) peptide expression. Subsequently, we confirmed that hUC-MSCs-sEVs could alleviate cell junction destruction and downregulate MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression after SCI, contributing to BSCB repair through ET-1 inhibition.

      "Breast cancer (BC), a significant global health concern, impacts millions of women worldwide. A key genetic factor in this disease is the presence of BReast CAncer gene (BRCA) mutations, which increase susceptibility to BC. This narrative review explores the crucial role of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in treating metastatic BC in individuals with BRCA gene mutations. In BRCA mutation carriers, these inhibitors induce synthetic lethality, leading to cell death due to the accumulation of lethal DNA breaks. Clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib and talazoparib, in extending progression-free survival and response rates, especially in patients without prior chemotherapy. Moreover, this review discusses combination therapies, where PARP inhibitors are combined with cytostatic drugs like platinum-based chemotherapy. Some studies show the synergy of these approaches, even in patients without homologous recombination deficiency. In summary, PARP inhibitors offer hope for improving outcomes in metastatic BC patients with BRCA gene mutations. As research advances, PARP inhibitors continue to hold promise in the fight against BC.\n",

      "Cigarette smoking acknowledged as the foremost contributor to preventable illnesses and deaths, has steadily risen since its inception, evolving into a global health crisis of paramount significance, particularly within the context of medical students who represent the future healthcare workforce. This study, conducted at Quaid-e-Azam Medical College, Bahawalpur, aimed to comprehensively evaluate current students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning cigarette smoking. Employing a web-based cross-sectional observational descriptive study design over the study period from June 15, 2020, to August 1, 2020, a sample of 200 medical students drawn from the first to fifth year was examined using stratified sampling. Data collection involved the distribution of a meticulously designed and pre-tested questionnaire through social media platforms, encompassing inquiries about participants' biodata and research-related topics. The subsequent data analysis utilized Google Spreadsheets, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and SPSS software to calculate percentages, create graphical representations, construct tables, and apply the chi-square test. The survey findings illuminated a remarkably high level of awareness, with 99% of respondents recognizing the harmful effects of smoking, including elevated cancer risk, and 94% acknowledging its addictive nature. A substantial 93% regarded passive smoking as equally detrimental as active smoking. In comparison, 98.5% were aware of the heightened risk of respiratory illnesses in children exposed to smoking. The majority exhibited a responsible stance towards discouraging smoking, with 90.5% feeling a duty to encourage cessation and 71.5% considering maintaining good health a sufficient incentive to quit. Additionally, 97% concurred that smoking in the presence of children should be avoided. Concerning smoking cessation, 64.5% believed high taxes were effective, and 97.5% deemed public smoking bans effective measures. Notably, 74% thought professional advice had limited influence on a smoker's attitude. Active smokers constituted a mere 20% of the sample, with a mere 2% commencing smoking before age 16 and 10% succumbing to peer pressure or media influence as instigating factors. Furthermore, 13.5% reported exam-related anxiety as a trigger for smoking, and 10% admitted to smoking in the company of non-smokers. Encouragingly, 19.5% expressed a desire to quit, with 5% seeking professional guidance in their cessation attempts. In conclusion, most participants exhibited commendable knowledge and a positive attitude towards cigarette smoking, contributing to a low prevalence of tobacco consumption among them. Nevertheless, the study underscores the need for ongoing improvements through targeted educational initiatives and governmental regulations to further mitigate tobacco use among future healthcare professionals and the broader population.\n",

However, neurocognitive dysfunction is one of the late adverse events of PCI and is often problematic. Recently, hippocampal avoidance prophylactic cranial irradiation (HA-PCI) is sometimes performed to prevent neurocognitive dysfunction after PCI. In HA-PCI, the question is whether or not metastases appear around the hippocampus that were not irradiated. We have experienced a case of perihippocampal meningeal carcinomatosis after HA-PCI. We also draw attention to the potential risks of performing HA-PCI based on this experience.\n",
      "Multiple hereditary exostosis syndrome is a rare diagnosis with approximately 1:50000 incidence prevailing in males. The exostoses or osteochondromas are benign but have the potential for malignant transformation in 1-5%. There is a strong genetic component, with exostosis (EXT) signaling pathways being an underlying cause. They can be symptomatic, with pain and functional deficit as the main complaints. We present a case of a 17-year-old male who presented with pain and anatomical deformity in his left lower femur. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple osteochondromas compressing the popliteal neurovascular bundle. Excision of the osteochondromas was performed to decompress the neurovascular bundle in a multidisciplinary approach. Histological examination demonstrated no evidence of malignancy. Currently, there is no consensus for patients diagnosed with multiple osteochondromas regarding further investigation and/or screening for malignant transformation.\n",
      "For a cervical cancer control program to be effective in reducing the incidence of the disease, there should be high compliance to treatment and follow-up of women diagnosed with precursor lesions. Screening programs in low-resource countries such as Uganda are challenged by poor adherence to follow-up following treatment for premalignant cervical lesions. This study sought to describe the burden and factors associated with loss to follow-up among women undergoing treatment for premalignant cervical lesions at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda.\n",
      "This was a retrospective cohort study. We reviewed the registers at the Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) cervical cancer clinic for a period of four years from January 2017 to December 2020. Data on age, district of residence, diagnosis, date of diagnosis, date and type of initial treatment, and date of follow-up visit were collected. We also captured data on whether patients returned on the scheduled follow-up date or within three months after the scheduled follow-up date. We defined loss to follow-up as failure to return for follow-up either on the scheduled date or within three months after the scheduled date.\n",
      "Out of the 298 patients who underwent treatment for premalignant cervical lesions in the study period, 227 (76.2%) did not return for follow-up at one year. At bivariate analysis, failure to attend the review visit at six weeks predicted the loss to follow-up at one year following treatment for premalignant lesions almost perfectly (risk ratio (RR)=2.84, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18-3.71, p<0.001). Negative HIV serostatus and receiving thermocoagulation slightly increased the risk of getting lost to follow-up, while being more than 45 years old reduced the odds. At multivariate analysis, treatment with thermocoagulation (adjusted risk ratio (aRR)=1.21, 95% CI: 1.07-1.36, p=0.03) was associated with loss to follow-up at one year.\n",
      "The proportion of women who did not return for follow-up at one year following treatment for premalignant cervical lesions at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital is very high. There is a need to implement strategies such as telephone-aided reminders to prompt patients to return for follow-up following treatment for premalignant cervical lesions.\n",

In the majority of melanomas, skin melanocytes can become damaged by ultraviolet radiation and cause melanoma. However, in rare cases, melanocytes in mucosal tissue can develop into melanoma, which can be challenging to diagnose and treat. This case report describes managing and treating a patient with an extremely rare primary cancer finding. We describe the case of a patient who was diagnosed with primary metastatic melanoma of the urinary tract following an extensive and detailed diagnostic period of 2.5 months. After review by an interdisciplinary tumor board and a shared decision-making process with the patient, he agreed to immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab. The patient survived nearly five months after the initiation of treatment. The cause of death was challenging to determine due to it being unwitnessed; however, it is suspected to be cardiovascular-related, owing to a history of severe cardiovascular disease and an acute stress event prior to death.\n",

      "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCa) is a highly lethal malignancy of biliary tract epithelial cells. Liver fluke infection is one of the well-known causes of CCa in endemic areas of Southeast Asian and Western Pacific regions. Multistep processes underlie carcinogenesis induced by chronic infection with the fish-borne liver fluke. Mechanical injury from fluke feeding and migrating in the bile duct causes damage to the bile duct epithelial cells. The excretory or secretory product of a parasite called OvGRN-1 is internalized by human cholangiocytes and induces changes in gene and protein expression associated with wound healing and cancer pathways. Inflammatory cytokines and their gene polymorphisms may also be linked to biliary pathologies. High plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) increase the risk of developing advanced periductal fibrosis (APF) and CCa by promoting CCa cell line proliferation. Anti-helminthic drugs can help decrease the risk of CCa caused by flukes. Surgical resection of the tumor and liver transplantation might be helpful too. Chemotherapy is considered for patients with advanced CCa when they cannot undergo surgery or when other treatment options fail to show improvement. Improvements in hygiene, health education, screening for fluke infection, and anti-helminthic therapy can help prevent liver fluke infection and thus the occurrence of CCa.\n",
      "Introduction Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the United States. Surgery remains integral to the curative management of non-metastatic gastric cancer. However, delays to the date of surgery for gastric cancer patients are commonplace. To investigate the impact of treatment delays on gastric cancer mortality, we conducted a multivariable analysis of over 36,000 patients. Materials & methods After querying the National Cancer Database and excluding patients who did not meet inclusion criteria, our sample included 36,598 patients with stage I-III gastric cancer. We ran multivariable logistic regressions by regressing 90-day mortality on wait time. Other co-variables included sex, race, age, area of residence, comorbidities, insurance, histology, tumor grade, tumor stage, resection margins, treatment facility type, and treatment with chemotherapy. Results Our results demonstrated that each day of increased waiting time is associated with a 0.5% decrease in 90-day mortality. Other statistically significant predictors of higher 90-day mortality risk included male sex, black or white race, living in a small metropolitan or non-metropolitan area, older age, more severe comorbidities, non-private insurance, non-gastric stromal tumor cancer, non-well differentiated tumors, worse clinical stage, residual cancer, treatment at non-academic center, and no adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that patients with longer wait times until surgery do not experience worse outcomes. These results are reassuring and can be cited to alleviate patient concerns.\n",
      "Background Early-stage prostate cancer may not show any signs. Digital rectal examination and the prostate-specific antigen test are frequently used in the screening for prostate cancer. The objective of this research is to assess the knowledge and awareness of screening prostate cancer among males in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. Methodology A cross-sectional study was performed among Saudi males in Tabuk City. A structured interviewing technique based on a questionnaire was used based on the objectives and research questions. Data were collected by well-trained data collectors from the general population in Tabuk City who were randomly chosen in proportion to the city's population density. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to evaluate the variables related to knowledge and awareness in this study. Results This questionnaire was completed by a total of 417 male participants. In the studied group, 86.8% of participants had heard about prostate cancer through friends (59%), TV/radio/newspaper (53.24%), and other health services (41.49%). In addition, around 67.6% of participants knew about the prostate cancer screening test. In addition, 32.4% of participants had no prior knowledge of prostate cancer or a screening test. Conclusions There was a good level of awareness and attitude toward screening methods for prostate cancer (54.7%). Aside from having good knowledge regarding prostate cancer symptoms among males in Tabuk City, all participants with regard to demographic distribution showed a significant level of good knowledge and awareness of screening prostate cancer methods and the necessity of performing regular prostate examinations.\n",
      "Renal oncopathology in adults, as a field of pathology, is dominated by a single entity - clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with other entries, such as urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis, angiosarcoma, and others being extremely rare. Herein, we report two histopathological cases with differential diagnoses of spindle cell renal neoplasms. The first patient, a 42-year-old male, presented with new-onset right-sided abdominal flank pain, and imaging showed a 12 cm renal tumor. Histopathology showed a spindle cell neoplasm, with significant mitotic activity and giant cell, with immunohistochemistry being positive for caldesmon and vimentin, focally for smooth muscle actin (SMA). No reaction was noted for pan-cytokeratin (CK AE1/AE3), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin (CK) 7, cluster of differentiation (CD) 117, soluble 100 protein (S100), human melanoma black (HMB) 45, Melan A, CD10, and desmin. Due to peculiar histomorphology and the immunophenotype, the tumor was interpreted as primary renal leiomyosarcoma. Due to continuous outpatient consultations, treatment initiation was delayed, and three months later, the patient had already developed an 87 mm local recurrence and liver metastasis. The second patient, a 53-year-old male, presented to our institution for consultation of an already excised renal tumor, diagnosed as an incidental finding on a prophylactic abdominal ultrasound. The tumor presented for consultation histologically grew as intertwining bundles of spindle cells with polymorphic hyperchromic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and had extensive areas with necrosis. Immunohistochemically, the tumor diffusely expressed CK AE1/AE3 and caldesmon and had a patchy reaction for EMA and CD10. The SMA, desmin, CD117, and CK7 reactions were negative; hence, the tumor was interpreted as a spindle cell variety (sub-type) of clear RCC.\n",

      "Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents 10% of all cancer types, making it the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Metastasis is the primary factor causing mortality in CRC patients. Approximately 22% of CRC-related deaths have metastasis present at diagnosis, with approximately 70% of these cases recurring. Recently, with the application of novel targeted drugs, targeted therapy has become the first-line option for individualized and comprehensive treatment of CRC. The management of these patients remains a significant medical challenge. The most prevalent targeted therapies for CRC in clinical practice focus on anti-vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and multi-target kinase inhibitors. In the wake of advancements in precision diagnosis and widespread adoption of second-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, rare targets such as BRAF V600E mutation, KRAS mutation, HER2 overexpression/amplification, and MSI-H/dMMR in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are increasingly being discovered. Simultaneously, new therapeutic drugs targeting these mutations are being actively investigated. This article reviews the progress in clinical research for developing targeted therapeutics for CRC, in light of advances in precision medicine and discovery of new molecular target drugs.\n",

Hawthorn, the plant from which hawthorn leaves are prepared, is distributed in Northeast China, North China, and other regions in China. Hawthorn leaves are known to activate blood circulation and eliminate stasis, invigorating Qi, eliminating turbidity, and reducing the levels of lipids. So far, over a hundred compounds have been isolated from hawthorn leaves, including flavonoids, terpenoids, lignans, organic acids, and nitrogenous compounds. Hawthorn leaves are used for the treatment of hypertension, protecting against ischemic injury, angina, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and certain other conditions. Several of the currently available clinical preparations also use hawthorn leaves as raw materials, such as Yixintong capsules, Xinan capsules, etc. The present report systematically reviews the chemical composition, biological activities, and quality standards of hawthorn leaves, to provide a scientific basis and reference for detailed research on hawthorn leaves.\n",
      "Long-term administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) induces TKI resistance in cells. The appearance of resistant cells requires the combined administration of another therapeutic agent and may cause side effects in the gastrointestinal and central nervous system. In previous studies, we found that derivatives of cilengitide, a cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide, exert NSCLC apoptotic and anti-epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) effects. In particular, cRGDwV and cRGDyV, which are cyclic peptides containing aromatic amino acids, were found to inhibit NSCLC cell growth, TGF-β1-induced EMT, and invasion. In this study, we confirmed the effects of cRGDwV and cRGDyV on proliferation, TGF-β1-induced EMT marker expression, migration, and invasion in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC A549 (A549GR) cells. In A549GR cells, cRGDwV and cRGDyV showed inhibitory effects on the expression of mesenchymal marker expression, migration, and invasion. These results indicate that cyclic RGD peptides containing aromatic amino acids can be used to inhibit mesenchymal marker expression as well as migration and invasion in gefitinib-resistant cells.\n",
      "Whether neoadjuvant therapy confers a survival benefit in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) remains uncertain. The primary endpoints of previous retrospective and phase II clinical studies that used neoadjuvant therapy, including androgen deprivation therapy combined with new-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitors or chemotherapy, were pathological downstaging, progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen relief, and local symptom improvement. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have explored the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy in improving the surgical resection rate in cases of unresectable primary tumors of PCa. We first designed this retrospective study to evaluate the potential value of apalutamide as neoadjuvant therapy in improving the resectability rate of radical prostatectomy (RP). We initially reported 7 patients with unresectable primary lesions who underwent neoadjuvant apalutamide treatment for a median of 4 months, and all of them successfully underwent RP treatment. Our study supported apalutamide as neoadjuvant therapy, which helped improve RP's success rate and did not significantly increase perioperative complications, and the neoadjuvant therapy was controllable. Our findings' clinical value and benefit for survival still need further clinical research to confirm.\n",
      "Increased production and buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to various health issues, including metabolic problems, cancers, and neurological conditions. Our bodies counteract ROS with biological antioxidants such as SOD, CAT, and GPx, which help prevent cellular damage. However, if there is an imbalance between ROS and these antioxidants, it can result in oxidative stress. This can cause genetic and epigenetic changes at the molecular level. This review delves into how ROS plays a role in disorders caused by oxidative stress. We also look at animal models used for researching ROS pathways. This study offers insights into the mechanism, pathology, epigenetic changes, and animal models to assist in drug development and disease understanding.\n",

      "The field of pharmacogenetics (PGx) holds great promise in advancing personalized medicine by adapting treatments based on individual genetic profiles. Despite its benefits, there are still economic, ethical and institutional barriers that hinder its implementation in our healthcare environment. A retrospective analysis approach of anonymized data sourced from electronic health records was performed, encompassing a diverse patient population and evaluating key parameters such as prescribing patterns and test results, to assess the impact of pharmacogenetic testing. A head-to-head comparison with previously published activity results within the same pharmacogenetic laboratory was also conducted to contrast the progress made after 10 years. The analysis revealed significant utilization of pharmacogenetic testing in daily clinical practice, with 1,145 pharmacogenetic tests performed over a 1-year period and showing a 35% growth rate increase over time. Of the 17 different medical departments that sought PGx tests, the Oncology department accounted for the highest number, representing 58.47% of all genotyped patients. A total of 1,000 PGx tests were requested for individuals susceptible to receive a dose modification based on genotype, and 76 individuals received a genotype-guided dose adjustment. This study presents a comprehensive descriptive analysis of real-world data obtained from a public tertiary hospital laboratory specialized in pharmacogenetic testing, and presents data that strongly endorse the integration of pharmacogenetic testing into everyday clinical practice.\n",

Breast self-examination (BSE) is a helpful screening method that gives women more control over their bodies by educating them about the structures of their breasts and assisting in the early detection of any developing breast abnormalities. The purpose of this research was to assess Palestinian girls' degree of BSE awareness and practice.\n",
      "A self-administered questionnaire was used to gauge participants' knowledge about BC and associated topics. Through an online survey, all girls above the age of 20 are encouraged to take part in the study. Female university students at academic levels I, II, III, and IV in Palestine were also invited to participate in the study by way of an online survey.\n",
      "The study included 467 female participants, with 69% of the individuals being single. The majority of females (68.7%) scored poorly on knowledge of BC disease (possible risk, methods of detection, methods of diagnosis, methods of treatment, signs and symptoms, information about mammography, and other knowledge questions), whereas only 31.7% scored well.\n",

In this initial experience, we assessed diagnostic performance of mpMRI in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) after FT.\n",
      "This single-centre phase II prospective clinical trial recruited 28 men with localized csPCa for FT between October 2019 and April 2021. 12-months post FT mpMRI were performed prior to biopsy and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of all mpMRI positive subjects were analysed. Chi square goodness of fit test correlated biopsy positive PIRADS3 (P3) and PIRADS4/5 lesions with histology grade group. One way ANOVA test assessed performance of ADC values in differentiating csPCa, non csPCa and benign lesions.\n",
      "Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of mpMRI were 100%, 14.28%, 53.84% and 100% for subjects with histologically proven cancer. Correlation of PIRADS v2.1 scores with histologically proven prostate cancer was statistically significant (p < 0.5). Correlation of P3 lesions with non-csPCa was statistically significant (p < 0.02535). Higher ADC value was associated with benign histology (adjusted odds ratio OR 0.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.94, 0.99) (p = 0.008). Among the malignant lesions, higher ADC value was associated with non-csPCa (adjusted OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99) (p = 0.032).\n",

      "The EAT-Lancet diet (ELD) is a recommended dietary pattern for achieving simultaneous improvements in both individual health and environmental sustainability. While research on the association between ELD and colorectal cancer (CRC) remains scarce, the potential impact of nutrition on CRC prevention and progression is a topic of growing interest. This study aims to investigate the relationship between adherence to the ELD and the risk of CRC, shedding light on the role of nutrition in CRC prevention.\n",
      "A total of 98,415 participants were included. A Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) was used to collect dietary information, and an ELD score was used to assess adherence to ELD. Higher scores indicated greater adherence. Cox hazard regression analyses were conducted to examine whether there were associations between the ELD score and CRC risk. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) model was used to further explore the dose-response association between the ELD score and CRC incidence. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential modifiers that interacted with ELD on CRC incidence, and sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the established association.\n",
      "During a mean follow-up of 8.82 years, a total of 1,054 CRC cases were documented. We found a statistically significant correlation between the ELD score and CRC risk (Q4 vs. Q1: HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.98; P for trend = 0.034) after adjusting for potential confounders. No statistically significant associations were discovered between ELD adherence and CRC by anatomical site.

      "Diversity is a key element of diet quality. The Food Variety Score (FVS) is used to assess diversity, especially in low- and middle-income countries. It sums up the number of foods consumed ignoring their nutrient content. A more suitable index should combine the number of foods consumed and their nutritional composition. We adapted the Nutritional Functional Diversity indicator (NFD), proposed by ecologists, to measure diversity in the human diet. We compared NFD and FVS evaluating subjects' distributions across quartiles of the two diversity indices. To evaluate which one reflected a higher diet quality, we estimated associations between these two diversity indices and diet quality measures, i.e., the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015). Associations were expressed by odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n",
      "We used the data of controls only derived from an integrated series of hospital-based case-control cancer studies conducted in different Italian areas. The NFD identifies groups of foods based on a set of nutrients according to a cluster analysis. Some steps are required: creating a food-nutrient matrix; clustering of the Euclidean food-food distance matrix to identify groups of foods with nutritional (dis)similarities; and calculating the NFD as the ratio between the sum of branch lengths of the dendrogram belonging to the number of foods consumed by individuals (i.e., subject-specific diversity) and the sum of all branch lengths of the dendrogram (i.e., maximal diversity).\n",
      "More than one quarter of individuals (28.4%) were differently classified within quartiles of the two diversity indices. For both indices, increasing the diversity level increased the risk for adhering to MDS (OR for NFD = 11.26; 95% CI: 7.88-16.09, and OR for FVS = 6.80; 95% CI: 4.84-9.54) and to HEI-2015 (OR for NDF = 2.86; 95% CI: 2.39-3.42, and OR for FVS = 2.72; 95% CI: 2.27-3.26).

      "Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a common and debilitating form of postsurgical pain with neuropathic characteristics, presenting as burning, stabbing, or pulling sensations after mastectomy, lumpectomy, or other breast procedures. With a prevalence of 31%, the risk factors for PMPS include younger age, psychosocial factors, radiotherapy, axillary lymph node dissection, and a history of chronic pain. This review evaluates the pharmacological and surgical options for managing PMPS. Pharmacological treatment options include antidepressants, gabapentinoids, levetiracetam, capsaicin, and topical lidocaine. Procedural and surgical options include fat grafting, nerve blocks, radiofrequency ablation, peripheral nerve surgery, serratus plane block, and botulinum toxin injections. Despite the variety of therapeutic options available for patients, further randomized trials are required to conclude whether these treatments reduce the intensity of neuropathic pain in patients with PMPS. In particular, comparative studies and the inclusion of patients across a range of pain intensities will be essential to developing a treatment algorithm for PMPS. In conclusion, current management for these patients should be tailored to their individual requirements.\n",

      "Radiotherapy is a cornerstone of breast cancer therapy, but radiotherapy resistance is a major clinical challenge. Herein, we show a molecular classification approach for estimating individual responses to radiotherapy.\n",
      "Consensus clustering was adopted to classify radiotherapy-sensitive and -resistant clusters in the TCGA-BRCA cohort based upon prognostic differentially expressed radiotherapy response-related genes (DERRGs). The stability of the classification was proven in the GSE58812 cohort via NTP method and the reliability was further verified by quantitative RT-PCR analyses of DERRGs. A Riskscore system was generated through Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis, and verified in the GSE58812 and GSE17705. Treatment response and anticancer immunity were evaluated via multiple well-established computational approaches.\n",
      "We classified breast cancer patients as radiotherapy-sensitive and -resistant clusters, namely C1 and C2, also verified by quantitative RT-PCR analyses of DERRGs. Two clusters presented heterogeneous clinical traits, with poorer prognosis, older age, more advanced T, and more dead status in the C2. The C1 tumors had higher activity of reactive oxygen species and response to X-ray, proving better radiotherapeutic response. Stronger anticancer immunity was found in the C1 tumors that had rich immune cell infiltration, similar expression profiling to patients who responded to anti-PD-1, and activated immunogenic cell death and ferroptosis. The Riskscore was proposed for improving patient prognosis. High Riskscore samples had lower radiotherapeutic response and stronger DNA damage repair as well as poor anticancer immunity, while low Riskscore samples were more sensitive to docetaxel, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel.\n",

      "Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive malignant tumours with high morbidity and mortality. Although surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are common treatment options available for oesophageal cancer, the 5-year survival rate remains low after treatment. On the one hand, many oesophageal cancers are are discovered at an advanced stage and, on the other hand, treatment resistance is a major obstacle to treating locally advanced ESCC. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the main type of stromal cell in the tumour microenvironment, enhance tumour progression and treatment resistance and have emerged as a major focus of study on targeted therapy of oesophageal cancer.With the aim of providing potential, prospective targets for improving therapeutic efficacy, this review summarises the origin and activation of CAFs and their specific role in regulating tumour progression and treatment resistance in ESCC. We also emphasize the clinical potential and emerging trends of ESCC CAFs-targeted treatments.\n",

      "Our findings suggest that, in BIA-ALCL patients, the implant substitution and/or capsulectomy may delay the disease's onset. However, the risk of reoccurrence in an earlier time should be considered in these patients. Moreover, the time to BIA-ALCL onset slightly increased with age. Selection bias, lack of awareness, misdiagnosis, and limited data availability could be identified as limits of our study. An implant replacement should be considered according to a risk stratification approach to delay the BIA-ALCL occurrence in asymptomatic patients, although a stricter follow-up after the implant substitution should be recommended.\n",

      "Endometrial cancer, one of the most prevalent malignant cancers tumors of the female reproductive tract, has been increasing in incidence and mortality rates around the world. The Hippo pathway, one of the eight traditional human cancer signaling pathways, is an intricate signaling network that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration as well as restricting organ size in response to a range of intracellular and extracellular signals. Inhibiting the Hippo pathway results in aberrant activation of its downstream core component YAP/TAZ, which can enhance cancer cells' metabolism and maintain their stemness. Additionally, the Hippo pathway can modulate the tumor microenvironment and induce drug resistance, where tumorigenesis and tumor progression occur. However, the Hippo pathway has been little researched in endometrial cancer. Here, we aim to review how the Hippo pathway contributes to the onset, development and the potential treatment of endometrial cancer with the aim of providing new therapeutic targets.\n",

      "We conducted an extensive examination utilizing ssGSEA, ESTIMATE algorithm, WGCNA, and GSVA for gene set enrichment analysis, gene co-expression network analysis, and gene set variation analysis. An established prognostic model, utilizing immune-related WGCNA findings, was evaluated for its association with clinical characteristics and the tumor microenvironment (TME).\n",
      "The ssGSEA effectively categorized ccRCC into groups based on low and high metabolism. Strong associations were observed between scores related to metabolism and immune scores, ESTIMATE scores, stromal scores, and gene expression related to HLA. The analysis conducted by WGCNA revealed a module called the 'yellow module' that exhibited a significant correlation with the infiltration of immune cells and the survival rates of patients. A risk model was developed, demonstrating reliable predictive performance for patient survival outcomes. The risk model also correlated significantly with immune scores and HLA-related gene expressions, suggesting potential immune evasion mechanisms. The analysis of mutations in TCGA data revealed the mutational patterns of ccRCC, and there was a significant correlation between the risk score and clinical characteristics. The GSVA analysis revealed a notable enrichment of pathways associated with cancer in patients at high risk.

      "Lipid metabolism reprogramming is one of the most prominent metabolic anomalies in cancer, wherein cancer cells undergo dysregulation of lipid metabolism to acquire adequate energy, cell membrane building blocks, as well as signaling molecules essential for cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis. These adaptations enable cancer cells to effectively respond to challenges posed by the tumor microenvironment, leading to cancer therapy resistance and poor cancer prognosis. Head and neck cancer, ranking as the seventh most prevalent cancer, exhibits numerous abnormalities in lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, the precise role of lipid metabolic rewiring in head and neck cancer remains unclear. In line with the LIPID MAPS Lipid Classification System and cancer risk factors, the present review delves into the dysregulated molecules and pathways participating in the process of lipid uptake, biosynthesis, transportation, and catabolism. We also present an overview of the latest advancements in understanding alterations in lipid metabolism and how they intersect with the carcinogenesis, development, treatment, and prognosis of head and neck cancer.

NETRS significantly associated with LUAD patients' clinical characteristics, and patients at different NETRS groups showed significant differences on prognosis, TME characteristics, immune-related molecules' expression levels, gene mutation frequencies, response to immunotherapy, and drug sensitivity. Besides, NETRS was more powerful than 20 published gene signatures in predicting LUAD patients' survival. Nine independent cohorts confirmed that NETRS is also valuable in predicting the prognosis of all NSCLC patients.

      "Nearly a billion people worldwide are infected with the hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and about a third of them have chronic infection. HBV is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, including acute and chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Screening and control of primary HBV infection through vaccination represent a major advance in global public health, but large sections of the world population, in both developed and underdeveloped countries, remain unscreened and unvaccinated. In addition to being a global cause of liver disease, an important role of HBV in lymphoma has also emerged. First, the high risk of HBV reactivation in previously infected patients receiving chemo-immunotherapy necessitates the systematic evaluation of HBV serological status in all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cases and preemptive antiviral therapy for those who may have chronic or occult HBV infection. Second, HBV has been shown to infect lymphocytes, namely B-cells, and has been associated with a higher risk of developing B-cell lymphoma, most clearly in countries where HBV is endemic. While the risk of HBV reactivation with chemoimmunotherapy in NHL is well known, the role and the impact of HBV as a global lymphoma risk factor and potential oncogenic driver in B-cells are very poorly understood. Here, we review the clinical and scientific evidence supporting an association between HBV and B-cell lymphoma, with a particular focus on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and provide an overview of the estimated impact of HBV infection on the biology and clinical course of DLBCL. We also discuss ways to gain a better insight into the unmet need posed by HBV in lymphoma and whether assessing immune responses to HBV, measuring viral loads, and detecting the presence of HBV-encoded proteins in tumor tissue could be integrated into the molecular and clinical risk stratification of patients with DLBCL.\n",
      "Radiation therapy is a common treatment option for Head and Neck Cancer (HNC), where the accurate segmentation of Head and Neck (HN) Organs-AtRisks (OARs) is critical for effective treatment planning. Manual labeling of HN OARs is time-consuming and subjective. Therefore, deep learning segmentation methods have been widely used. However, it is still a challenging task for HN OARs segmentation due to some small-sized OARs such as optic chiasm and optic nerve.\n",
      "To address this challenge, we propose a parallel network architecture called PCG-Net, which incorporates both convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a Gate-Axial-Transformer (GAT) to effectively capture local information and global context. Additionally, we employ a cascade graph module (CGM) to enhance feature fusion through message-passing functions and information aggregation strategies. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of PCG-Net and its robustness in three different downstream tasks.\n",

      "Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the three most prevalent gynecological tumors affecting women and is the most prevalent gynecological malignancy in the developed world. Its incidence is rapidly increasing worldwide, mostly affecting postmenopausal women, whereas recently its prevalence has increased in younger people. EC is an immune gene disease and many studies have shown that the tumor-immunosuppressive microenvironment plays an important role in cancer progression. In recent years, findings regarding the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITME) of EC have included immune evasion mechanisms and immunotherapy, which are mostly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for EC. Recently studies on the ITME of different molecular types of EC have found that different molecular types may have different ITME. With the research on the immune microenvironment of EC, a new immunophenotype classification based on the immune microenvironment has been carried out in recent years. However, the impact of the ITME on EC remains unclear, and the immunophenotype of EC remains limited to the research stage. Our review describes recent findings regarding the ITME features of different EC molecular types.

      "Tumour Mutation Burden (TMB) is a potential biomarker for immune cancer therapies. Here we investigated parameters that might affect TMB using duplicate cytology smears obtained from endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS TBNA)-sampled malignant lymph nodes.\n",
      "Individual Diff-Quik cytology smears were prepared for each needle pass. DNA extracted from each smear underwent sequencing using large gene panel (TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500 - Illumina)). TMB was estimated using the TSO500 Local App v. 2.0 (Illumina).\n",
      "Twenty patients had two or more Diff-Quik smears (total 45 smears) which passed sequencing quality control. Average smear TMB was 8.7 ± 5.0 mutations per megabase (Mb). Sixteen of the 20 patients had paired samples with minimal differences in TMB score (average difference 1.3 ± 0.85). Paired samples from 13 patients had concordant TMB (scores below or above a threshold of 10 mutations/Mb). Markedly discrepant TMB was observed in four cases, with an average difference of 11.3 ± 2.7 mutations/Mb. Factors affecting TMB calling included sample tumour content, the amount of DNA used in sequencing, and bone fide heterogeneity of node tumour between paired samples.\n",
      "TMB assessment is feasible from EBUS-TBNA smears from a single needle pass. Repeated samples of a lymph node station have minimal variation in TMB in most cases. However, this novel data shows how tumour content and minor change in site of node sampling can impact TMB. Further study is needed on whether all node aspirates should be combined in 1 sample, or whether testing independent nodes using smears is needed.\n",
      "Existing evidence suggests that palliative care (PC) is highly underutilized in metastatic gynecologic cancer (mGCa). This study aims to explore temporal trends and predictors for inpatient PC referral in mGCa patients who received specific critical care therapies (CCT).\n",
      "The National Inpatient Sample from 2003 to 2015 was used to identify mGCa patients receiving CCT. Basic characteristics were compared between patients with and without PC. Annual percentage change (APC) was estimated to reflect the temporal trend in the entire cohort and subgroups. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to explore potential predictors of inpatient PC referral.\n",
      "In total, 122,981 mGCa patients were identified, of whom 10,380 received CCT. Among these, 1,208 (11.64%) received inpatient PC. Overall, the rate of PC referral increased from 1.81% in 2003 to 26.30% in 2015 (APC: 29.08%). A higher increase in PC usage was found in white patients (APC: 30.81%), medium-sized hospitals (APC: 31.43%), the Midwest region (APC: 33.84%), and among patients with ovarian cancer (APC: 31.35%). Multivariable analysis suggested that medium bedsize, large bedsize, Midwest region, West region, uterine cancer and cervical cancer were related to increased PC use, while metastatic sites from lymph nodes and genital organs were related to lower PC referral.\n",
      "Further studies are warranted to better illustrate the barriers for PC and finally improve the delivery of optimal end-of-life care for mGCa patients who receive inpatient CCT, especially for those diagnosed with ovarian cancer or admitted to small scale and Northeast hospitals.\n",
      "Leukemia is the most frequently occurring cancer in children, and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is a rare subtype. LBL are lymphoid neoplasms of B or T cell origin and are primarily treated with chemotherapy. Although cure rates among children are excellent, these patients must be monitored for relapse. Cutaneous lesions involving B-cell LBL (B-LBL) are extremely rare and here we present a patient with a worsening B-LBL scalp mass who required radical surgical excision.\n",
      "A 6-year-old female patient with a history of a nontender scalp mass discovered at approximately 2-3 years of age was evaluated for resection of the nodule due to its size and treatment history. The patient was originally diagnosed with follicular lymphoma by punch biopsy; excision was successfully performed on this 4 cm lesion and upon examination of the skin biopsy did we get a diagnosis of B-LBL. Reconstruction of the scalp was done through the rotation flap method. The patient's scalp healed well, and adjuvant chemotherapy was continued. There has been no reoccurrence.\n",
      "Here we report the rarity of B-LBL cases involving extranodal involvement in the scalp. The most common reconstruction of scalp lesions has been using free flap from the anterolateral thigh (ALT) and latissimus dorsi (LD). Our case used the rotation flap, which has its functional and cosmetic benefits. The importance of monitoring this patient is emphasized due to the dangerous consequences of B-LBL relapse. Ultimately, our successful treatment and care of this rare case can be used as guidance for similar patients in the future.\n",

The main objective of this study is to identify the risk factors associated with major complications after TaTME and evaluate the perioperative clinical outcomes.\n",
      "A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of patients with mid-to-low rectal cancer who underwent TaTME surgery and were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University from January 2018 to May 2023. Univariate and multivariate regression methods were employed to analyze the risk factors influencing the occurrence of major complications (Clavien-Dindo III-V).\n",
      "This study included a total of 179 eligible cases, with no perioperative deaths. The overall incidence of early complications was 25.1%, with a rate of 10.1% for mild complications and 15.0% for major complications. The postoperative anastomotic leakage rate within 30 days was 6.7%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that male (P=0.030), pathological T ≥ 3 (P=0.018) and manual anastomosis (P=0.009) were independent risk factors for the development of major complications after surgery.\n",

      "The complement system is a powerful innate immune system deployed in the immediate response to pathogens and cancer cells. Complement factor H (CFH), one of the regulators involved in the complement cascade, can interrupt the death of target cells. Certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer, can adopt an aggressive phenotype, such as breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), through enhancement of the defense system against complement attack by amplifying various complement regulators. However, little is known about the association between CFH and BCSCs. In the present study, the roles of CFH in the CSC characteristics and radioresistance of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were investigated. CFH knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased the viability of the cells upon complement cascade activation. Notably, CFH knockdown also decreased cell survival and suppressed mammosphere formation, cell migration and cell invasion by attenuating radioresistance. Additionally, CFH knockdown further enhanced irradiation-induced apoptosis through G2/M cell cycle arrest. It was also discovered that CFH knockdown attenuated the aggressive phenotypes of cancer cells by regulating CSC-associated gene expression. Finally, by microarray analysis, it was found that the expression of erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 3 (EPB41L3) was markedly increased following CFH knockdown. EPB41L3 inhibited ERK and activated the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, these results indicated that CFH knockdown attenuated CSC properties and radioresistance in human breast cancer cells via controlling MAPK signaling and through upregulation of the tumor suppressor, EPB41L3.\n",
      "Thrombocytopenia is a characteristic adverse event of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), one of the essential treatment options for human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. The present study investigated the predictive value of thrombocytopenia for time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD) in patients receiving T-DM1 for advanced-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. The present observational study enrolled 138 patients who received T-DM1 at six oncology centers from January 2016 to December 2021. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the factors affecting TTD. The median age of patients was 50 years (range, 26-83). The median number of T-DM1 cycles was 9 (range, 2-58), the overall response rate was 50.0% and the disease control rate was 69.6%. At a median follow-up time of 19.3 months, the median TTD was 9.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.3-11.7], and the median overall survival was 28.2 months (95% CI, 19.2-37.2). Thrombocytopenia during treatment was observed in 39% of all patients, and 66.7% of these patients experienced early thrombocytopenia (in the first four treatment cycles). Multivariate analysis revealed that the independent factors for TTD were hormone receptor status [hazard ratio (HR), 1.837; 95% CI, 1.249-2.701; P=0.002], Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score (HR, 3.269; 95% CI, 1.788-5.976; P<0.001) and thrombocytopenia during treatment (HR, 0.297; 95% CI, 0.198-0.446; P<0.001). Patients with early thrombocytopenia had a significantly longer TTD of 17.3 months (95% CI, 11.8-22.8) compared with 7.6 months (95% CI, 5.8-9.4) for patients without early thrombocytopenia (P<0.001). The results of the present study indicated that patients with early thrombocytopenia had improved survival outcomes compared with those without. Thus, maximum benefit from T-DM1 treatment may be achieved by confirming the predictive role of thrombocytopenia in T-DM1 treatment in prospective studies and large-scale cohorts.\n",

      "The aim of the present study was to identify factors predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with cancer admitted to a medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and to evaluate their functional status and survival during follow-up at the oncology service in the initial 12 months after hospital discharge. A retrospective observational study was performed on 129 consecutive oncological patients with solid tumours admitted to the medical ICU of the Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain) between January 2016 and June 2018. Demographics, and clinical data in-ICU and in-hospital mortality were recorded. Post-hospital discharge follow-up was also carried out. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 24% (n=31) and 40.3% (n=52), respectively. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42; P=0.037), neutropenia on admission (HR, 8.53; 95% CI, 2.15-33.82; P=0.002), metastatic disease (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.82-8.45; P<0.001), need for invasive mechanical ventilation (HR, 5.78; 95% CI, 1.61-20.73; P=0.007), surgery during hospital admission (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09-0.61; P=0.003) and ICU stay (>48 h) (HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.04-0.29; P<0.001) were the independent risk factors for ICU mortality. Overall, 59.5% of the survivors had good functional status at hospital discharge and 28.7% of patients with cancer admitted to the ICU were alive 1 year after hospital discharge, most of them (85.7%) with good functional status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1). In conclusion, hospital mortality may be associated with SOFA score at ICU admission, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, neutropenia and metastatic disease. Only 40% of patients with oncological disease admitted to the ICU died during their hospital stay, and >50% of the survivors presented good functional status at hospital discharge. Notably, 1 year after hospital discharge, 28.7% of patients were alive, most of them with a good functional status.\n",

      "Primary liver cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumors seen in clinics, and typically exhibits aggressive invasive behaviors, a poor prognosis, and is associated with high mortality rates. Long-term stress exposure causes norepinephrine (NE) release and activates the β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR), which in turn exacerbates the occurrence and development of different types of cancers; however, the molecular mechanisms of β-AR in liver cancer are not fully understood. In the present study, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and RT-quantitative PCR showed that β-AR expression was upregulated in human liver cancer cells (HepG2) compared with normal liver cells (LO2). Moreover, NE treatment promoted the growth of HepG2 cells, which could be blocked by propranolol, a β-AR antagonist. Notably, NE had no significant effect on the migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HepG2 cells. Further experiments revealed that NE increased the phosphorylation levels of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), while inhibition of ERK1/2 and CREB activation significantly blocked NE-induced cell proliferation. In summary, the findings of the present study suggested that β-adrenergic receptor activation promoted the proliferation of HepG2 cells through ERK1/2/CREB signaling pathways.\n",
      "Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a heterogeneous syndrome of metastatic cancer in which the primary site cannot be determined even after a standard and comprehensive search. The present report describes a case in which the spatial distribution of the lymph node metastases contributed to the identification of the primary site. While the standard workup did not identify the primary tumor, genomic profiling analysis was useful in therapeutic management. A 68-year-old woman presented with a cancerous pleural effusion (adenocarcinoma). The primary site could not be identified, and the pleural effusion resolved spontaneously. After 11 months, the patient had elevated Krebs von den Lungen-6 and cancer antigen 125 levels, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Pathological diagnosis based on a biopsy sample of the para-aortic lymph nodes indicated that the tumor was a high-grade serous carcinoma of possible gynecological organ origin. The patient underwent surgery, including hysterectomy, bisalpingo-oophorectomy and lymph node dissection. Although there were no primary sites in the gynecological organs, marked lymphovascular invasion was found around the left ovary, suggesting a left ovary-derived tumor. Genetic testing revealed a high loss of heterozygosity score and high tumor mutational burden (TMB). The patient received paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy followed by a poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor as regimens for ovarian cancer and achieved complete remission. The unique course of the disappearance of the effusion and the absence of tumor in the adnexa might be associated with the high immunogenicity of the tumor characterized by the high TMB. This case may provide insights into the pathogenesis of CUP.\n",
      "Thyroid cancer is one of the most common types of endocrine malignancy. In addition to surgical treatment, it is very important to find new treatment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of 1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone (emodin) on cellular NF-κB components and the upstream regulatory pathway of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, as well as the invasion and migration of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) cells. The protein expression of NF-κB components p65 and p50 and their phosphorylated (p-) forms in the sections of PTC tissues was measured by individual immunohistochemical assays. PTC cell lines TPC-1 and IHH4 were exposed to 20 and 40 µM emodin for 24 h. The levels of the NF-κB components p65, p50, c-Rel, p-p65 and p-p50, elements in TLR4 signaling, including TLR4, MYD88 innate immune signal transduction adaptor (MyD88), interferon regulatory factor 3, AKT and MEK, and proliferative and apoptotic biomarkers, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Bcl-2 and Bax, were evaluated by western blotting and immunofluorescent assays. The invasion and migration of PTC cell lines exposed to emodin were tested by plate colony and wound healing assay. Compared with hyperplasia tissue, the expression levels of NF-κB components p65 and p50, and p-p65 and p-p50 in PTC tissue were significantly increased. Treatment of PTC cell lines with emodin lead to significantly reduced levels of the aforementioned NF-κB components, accompanied by markedly downregulated TLR4 signaling. MYD 88-dependent and -independent pathways, are also significantly down-regulated. Downregulation of proliferative factors and activation of apoptotic factors were observed in the cell lines following treatment with emodin. Consequently, inhibition of the invasion and migration activities were observed in the emodin-treated PTC cells. Emodin could inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of PTC cells, which is dependent on the downregulation of cellular NF-κB and the TLR4 signaling pathway.\n",
      "Malignant melanoma (MM) commonly presents as a primary skin tumor and respiratory MM cases are almost all metastatic. Primary lung MM (PMML) is quite rare, especially when manifested as an endobronchial pigmented mass, its diagnosis is relatively difficult and MM has a poor prognosis. Only a few cases have been described previously and the pathologic features, clinical behavior and therapeutic options are not well established. The present study reports the case of a 72-year-old female patient with PMML who denied any history of tumors. The patient complained of chest pain and coughing for 2 weeks. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass in the right upper lobe and an enlarged mediastinal lymph node. Positron emission tomogram-CT suggested a hypermetabolic tumor. To confirm the diagnosis, the patient underwent a transbronchial forceps biopsy and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration, which confirmed the diagnosis of PMML.

      "Ephrin A3 (EFNA3) is a member of the Eph/ephrin tyrosine kinase family, which is associated with multiple signaling pathways involved in cell growth and tumor cell metastasis. Aberrant regulation of EFNA3 is associated with the occurrence and development of various types of cancer. However, despite the high incidence of EFNA3 upregulation in cancer, studies concerning EFNA3 in urothelial carcinoma have not, to the best of our knowledge, been conducted. In the present study, bioinformatics analyses using data from multiple online databases were performed to confirm the upregulation of EFNA3 in bladder cancer. The co-expression gene set of EFNA3 and enriched signaling pathways were also analyzed. In addition, immunohistochemistry was conducted to detect EFNA3 expression in 491 clinically confirmed bladder urothelial carcinoma samples and 80 non-cancerous bladder tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, binary logistic regression analysis, and Cox regression analysis were conducted to confirm the validity of EFNA3 in predicting patient prognosis and its significance in clinical pathology. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant association between EFNA3 expression levels with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and pathological grade. In conclusion, high EFNA3 expression may be a potential biomarker that indicates bladder tumor occurrence and patient prognosis.\n",
      "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) ranks third in the incidence of gynecological malignancies. m6A methylation as RNA modification plays a crucial role in the evolution, migration, and invasion of various tumors. However, the role of m6A methylation in ovarian cancer (OC) only recently has begun to be appreciated. Therefore, we used various bioinformatic methods to screen the public GEO datasets of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) for m6A methylation-related regulators. We identified methyltransferase 16 (METTL16) that was dramatically downregulated in EOC as such a regulator. We also identified metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), a known target lncRNA of METTL16, in these five GEO datasets. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical staining confirmed that compared with the normal ovarian tissues and cells, METTL16 was significantly downregulated, while lncRNA MALAT1 was significantly upregulated, in 30 EOC tissues of our own validation cohorts and EOC cell lines, revealing a negative correlation between METTL16 and lncRNA MALAT1. Moreover, our analysis unveiled a correlation between downregulated METTL16 and the known adverse prognostic factors of EOC patients in our own cohorts. The CCK-8, EdU, scratch wound healing, and transwell invasion assays revealed that METTL16 significantly suppressed the proliferating, migrating, and invading abilities of OC cells. The inhibitory effects of METTL16 on the in vivo tumor growth of EOC cells were measured by subcutaneous tumor formation assay in mice. Furthermore, the RIP, RNA stability assay, western blotting, and cytoimmunofluorescence staining showed that METTL16 hindered the growth of EOC cells through promoting the degradation of MALAT1 by binding that, in turn, upregulates \n",

      "Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for a better prognosis. Various studies have been conducted where tumor lesions are detected and localized on images. This is a narrative review where the studies reviewed are related to five different image modalities: histopathological, mammogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) images, making it different from other review studies where fewer image modalities are reviewed. The goal is to have the necessary information, such as pre-processing techniques and CNN-based diagnosis techniques for the five modalities, readily available in one place for future studies. Each modality has pros and cons, such as mammograms might give a high false positive rate for radiographically dense breasts, while ultrasounds with low soft tissue contrast result in early-stage false detection, and MRI provides a three-dimensional volumetric image, but it is expensive and cannot be used as a routine test. Various studies were manually reviewed using particular inclusion and exclusion criteria; as a result, 91 recent studies that classify and detect tumor lesions on breast cancer images from 2017 to 2022 related to the five image modalities were included. For histopathological images, the maximum accuracy achieved was around 99 \n",

Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion has been observed in 3-7% of cases of lung adenocarcinoma. ALK inhibitor therapy has been shown to exert a positive effect on disease progression. The present study describes the case of a patient with ALK-positive non-small cell lung carcinoma and thyroid metastases who exhibited a minimal response to ALK inhibitor therapy in the primary lesion, but had a complete pathological response in the thyroid, as confirmed by a thyroid biopsy.

      "Castleman disease (CD) describes a group of rare heterogeneous lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by enlarged hyperplastic lymph nodes. It is classified into unicentric CD (UCD) and multicentric CD (MCD). The present retrospective study examined the data of 11 patients with CD diagnosed and treated at a tertiary cancer center from 2017 to 2022. The median age of the study group was 41 years (range, 24 to 68 years). There were 8 males and 3 females. In total, 7 patients were diagnosed with UCD and 4 patients with MCD. The hyaline-vascular variant was the most common histology in both UCD and MCD. Among the 7 patients with UCD, 5 patients underwent excision, 1 patient underwent debulking followed by radiotherapy and 1 patient received single agent rituximab. Of the patients with UCD, 6 had a complete response (CR) and 1 patient had a partial response (PR). All 4 patients with MCD received systemic treatment, which included single agent rituximab (2 patients), rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (RCHOP) (1 patient) and CHOP (1 patient). Among the patients with MCD, 1 patient attained a CR, 2 patients had a PR and 1 patient succumbed. The 3-year survival rate for the study population was 91%. In summary, CD is a rare disease occurring in immunodeficient patients. UCD is more common and is associated with better outcomes. Surgery is the mainstay of management in UCD whereas MCD requires combination chemotherapy.\n",

This scoping review aims to synthesize evidence on the key determinants that are most valued by breast cancer patients when deciding on their treatment options.\n",
      "We searched three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL Plus) utilizing a systematic scoping review method. Two reviewers independently screened, applied inclusion criteria, reviewed, and synthesized findings. A mixed-method narrative approach combining the inductive thematic analysis and content analysis methodologies was used to synthesize and summarize the findings.\n",
      "The review included 22 studies, leading to the conceptualization of 5 overarching themes and 17 sub-themes. Among these, the most frequently cited theme was treatment benefits, followed by treatment-related process, treatment-related risk, quality of life, and cost of treatment. Women with breast cancer highly value treatments that offer good effectiveness, prolong survival, prevent recurrence, and maintain quality of life. Patient concerns include treatment-related side effects, safety, the risk of secondary cancer, and direct or indirect out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, patients also consider treatment duration, mode of administration, physician recommendation, and treatment availability and accessibility when deciding on their preferred treatment.\n",

The task force then formulated recommendations to achieve better patient outcomes and satisfaction based on evidence-based medicine and their clinical experience in BRCA-mutated breast cancer management.\n",
      "Eligibility of patients for genetic testing, physician acceptance and willingness to integrate genetic testing into routine practice is encouraging but remains restricted by testing availability and financial coverage. Until more data is available, genetic testing should be targeted for breast cancer patients based on tumor subtypes, as well as family and personal history of cancer, as per international guidelines. Whenever possible, genetic testing should aim to detect all actionable genes through a multigene panel including BRCA1/2. Major challenges faced in clinical practice in Jordan include fear of genetic discrimination and social stigmatization, as well as hesitancy toward risk-reducing surgery. Pre-testing counseling is therefore critical to promote acceptance of genetic testing. Since geneticists are in short supply in Jordan, genetic counseling can be offered through a specially trained genetic counselor or through a hybrid system that includes oncologist-based counselling. In addition to cancer prevention, germline genetic testing may assist in the selection of specific anti-cancer therapy, such as PARP inhibitors, in patients with BRCA1/2 mutation. Nationwide initiatives are also needed to ensure access to PARP inhibition therapy and provide financial coverage for genetic screening, mastectomies and reconstructive surgery across Jordan.\n",

E-cadherin expression decreased in all groups compared to the control group, illustrating the dual function of E-cadherin in the tumor microenvironment. Vascular density was reduced in the groups given HIF-1α inhibitor, ALK5 inhibitor, and ALK5 and HIF-1α inhibitor simultaneously. The percentage of PDGFR-β+ cells was reduced in the presence of HIF-1α inhibitor, ALK5 inhibitor, HIF-1α and ALK5 inhibitors, and upon simultaneous treatment with HIF-1α activator and ALK5 inhibitor.\n",
      "Despite increased expression and interaction between TGF-β and HIF-1α pathways in some cancers, in melanoma, inhibition of either pathway alone may have a stronger effect on tumor inhibition than simultaneous inhibition of both pathways. The synergistic effects may be context-dependent and should be further evaluated in different cancer types.\n",
      "Fundamental studies on biomarkers as well as developed assays for their detection can provide valuable information facilitating clinical decisions. For patients with lung cancer, there are established circulating biomarkers such as serum progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA21-1). There are also molecular biomarkers for targeted therapy such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, KRAS gene, and BRAF gene. However, there is still an unmet need for biomarkers that can be used for early detection and predict treatment response and survival. In this review, we describe the lung cancer biomarkers that are currently being used in clinical practice. We also discuss emerging preclinical and clinical studies on new biomarkers such as omics-based biomarkers for their potential clinical use to detect, predict, or monitor subtypes of lung cancer. Additionally, between-method differences in tumor markers warrant further development and improvement of the standardization and harmonization for each assay.\n",

      "To summarize the prognostic relevance of serum tumor markers (STM) for early and late-stage NSCLC patients treated with classical chemotherapies, novel targeted and immune therapies.\n",
      "A PubMed database search was conducted for prognostic studies on carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), neuron-specific enolase, squamous-cell carcinoma antigen, progastrin-releasing-peptide, CA125, CA 19-9 and CA 15-3 STMs in NSCLC patients published from 2008 until June 2022.\n",
      "Out of 1069 studies, 141 were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. A considerable heterogeneity regarding design, patient number, analytical and statistical methods was observed. High pretherapeutic CYFRA 21-1 levels and insufficient decreases indicated unfavorable prognosis in many studies on NSCLC patients treated with chemo-, targeted and immunotherapies or their combinations in early and advanced stages. Similar results were seen for CEA in chemotherapy, however, high pretherapeutic levels were sometimes favorable in targeted therapies. CA125 is a promising prognostic marker in patients treated with immunotherapies. Combinations of STMs further increased the prognostic value over single markers.\n",
      "Protein STMs, especially CYFRA 21-1, have prognostic potential in early and advanced stage NSCLC. For future STM investigations, better adherence to comparable study designs, analytical methods, outcome measures and statistical evaluation standards is recommended.\n",
      "Incidence of cancer is markedly reduced in patients with the hereditary neurodegenerative polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. We have very poor knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms, but the expanded polyQ sequence is assumed to play a central role, because it is common to the respective disease related proteins. The inhibition seems to take place in all kinds of cells, because the lower cancer frequency applies to nearly all types of tumors and is not related with the characteristic pathological changes in specific brain tissues. Further, the cancer repressing mechanisms appear to be active early in life including in pre-symptomatic and early phase polyQ patients. Autophagy plays a central role in clearing proteins with expanded polyQ tracts, and autophagy modulation has been demonstrated and particularly investigated in Huntington's disease (HD). Macroautophagy may be dysfunctional due to defects in several steps of the process, whereas increased chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) has been shown in HD patients, cell and animal models. Recently, CMA is assumed to play a key role in prevention of cellular transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. Investigations of normal cells from HD and other polyQ carriers could therefore add further insight into the protective mechanisms of CMA in tumorigenesis, and be important for development of autophagy based strategies to prevent malignant processes leading to cancer and neurodegeneration.\n",
      "To explore the prognostic impact of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) features for initially unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CLMs) in a clinical setting of conversion therapy.\n",
      "Between March 2015 and November 2020, consecutive patients with CLMs who received conversion treatment were prospectively enrolled. All participants underwent liver CEUS at baseline. The primary endpoint was conversion resection rate (R0 and overall resection). Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).\n",
      "104 participants who completed conversion treatment were included. CEUS enhancement pattern was correlated with index lesion (size and echogenicity), primary (site, differentiation, perineural invasion, and RAS genotype) and serum (CA19-9 level) characteristics (P = <0.001-0.016). CEUS enhancement pattern was significantly associated with R0 resection rate, ORR, PFS, and OS (P = 0.001-0.049), whereas enhancement degree was associated with PFS and OS (P = 0.043 and 0.045). Multivariate analysis showed that heterogeneous enhancement independently predicted R0 and overall resection (P = 0.028 and 0.024) while rim-like enhancement independently predicted ORR and OS (P = 0.009 and 0.026).\n",
      "CEUS enhancement pattern was significantly associated with tumor characteristics and clinical outcomes following conversion therapy, and thus might be of prognosis impact for initially unresectable CLMs.\n",
      "Hormonal receptor (HR) positive breast tumors are common. Adjuvant hormonal therapy (AHT) with tamoxifen or Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) is beneficial depending on the stage of the tumor. Despite the fact that AHT has been shown to improve survival and recurrence, Dutch adherence rates, which were mostly dependent on Tamoxifen prescriptions until 2006, plummeted from 80% after one year to 50% after five years. Nonadherence with AHT reduces its effectiveness. This research presents more recent adherence statistics (from 2006 to 2016), on a larger sample (7,996 vs 1,451), as well as factors that influence AHT adherence. In addition to tamoxifen data, AIs are now included.\n",
      "As low use of adjuvant endocrine therapy is a potentially important and modifiable risk factor for poor outcome, it is important to monitor the rate as an indicator of women's burden of disease and the direction of adherence trends.\n",
      "The Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) was used to find women with early-stage breast cancer who started AHT within a year of surgery and were linked to the PHARMO Database Network (n = 8,679). The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to measure AHT adherence five years after treatment was started, with a 60-day gap between refills as our primary outcome. Furthermore, the Medication Possession Rate (MPR) was determined using a cutoff of ≥80%. Analysis was performed on influential factors of adherence.\n",
      "The proportion of persistent women declined over time to reach 46.6% at the end of the fifth year and 53.3% of the women had a MPR ≥80% during the fifth year. Older and being diagnosed in 2006-2010 were associated with AHT adherence.\n",
      "Dutch 5-year AHT adherence appears to remain poor. Improving AHT adherence in HR+ breast cancer survivors is a critical medical need.\n",
      "After decades of focus on molecular genetics in cancer research, the role of metabolic and environmental factors is being reassessed. Here, we investigated the role of microenvironment in the promotion of malignant behavior in tumor cells with a different reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) versus lactic acid fermentation/Warburg effect. To this end, we evaluated the effects of microenvironmental challenges (hypoxia, acidity, and high glucose) on the expression of mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COX I) and two nuclear-encoded isoforms 4 (COX IV-1 and COX IV-2). We have shown that tumor cells with an \"OXPHOS phenotype\" respond to hypoxia by upregulating COX IV-1, whereas cells that rely on lactic acid fermentation maximized COX IV-2 expression. Acidity upregulates COX IV-2 regardless of the metabolic state of the cell, whereas high glucose stimulates the expression of COX I and COX IV-1, with a stronger effect in fermenting cells. Our results uncover that \"energy phenotype\" of tumor cells drives their adaptive response to microenvironment stress.\n",
      "Head and neck cancer (HNC) encompasses a number of malignancies originating in the head and neck area. In HNC patients, cervical lymph nodes constitute metastatic sites for cancer cells that escape primary tumors. The pre-metastatic niche (PMN) is a crucial concept in understanding metastatic disease. PMN refers to the microenvironment resulting mainly from primary tumor cells to foster metastatic tumor cells growth at a distant organ. Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important part in the pathogenesis of PMN. A significant prognostic factor is the close association between metastases of lymph node and organ dissemination in many different malignancies. The nodal pre-metastatic niche (NPMN) is a particular type of PMN located within the lymph nodes. NPMN formation is specifically important in HNC since regional lymph node metastasis commonly occurs. The formation happens when tumor cells create a supportive microenvironment within lymph nodes, facilitating their survival, growth, spread, and invasion. This complex mechanism involves multiple steps and cellular interactions between the primary tumor and tumor microenvironment. Several extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules, cytokines and growth factors are implicated in this process. The aim of this article is to present the most recent data on the regulation of the lymph node PMN at molecular and cellular level in HNC, as well as insights in respect to the relationship between primary tumor cells and the microenvironment of lymph nodes, and the formation of NPMN. We also critically discuss on potential targets for preventing or disrupting nodal metastases and identify potential biomarkers for predicting HNC outcomes.\n",
      "Aerobic glycolysis plays an important role in multidrug resistance of cancer cells. Here, we screened different expressed lncRNAs associated with sorafenib resistance of liver cancer cells, by intersecting the bioinformatics analyses of TCGA and GEO (the GSE62813 dataset) databases. Our results revealed that the 18 upregulated lncRNAs in the intersection are associated with and enriched in metabolism of small molecule organic acids, suggesting their potential in glycolysis. The lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (Snhg1) was chosen as a potential regulator of aerobic glycolysis in liver cancer cells, for its significant promotion on lactate production. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments mediated by Crispr-Cas9 technique in HepG2 cells indicated that Snhg1 promoted cell proliferation, invasion, sorafenib resistance, and aerobic glycolysis. In the mechanism exploration, we found that Snhg1 can interact with SND1 protein, a famous RNA binding protein and recently identified \"Reader\" of N6-methyladenosine (m6A). SND1 was demonstrated to be positively regulated by Snhg1 and had similar promoting effects on proliferation, invasion, sorafenib resistance, and aerobic glycolysis of HepG2 cells. SND1 bound with and promoted the expression of SLC7A11, an aerobic glycolysis regulator. Furthermore, either silencing SLC7A11 or blocking aerobic glycolysis with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) was able to reverse the promotion of Snhg1 overexpression on malignancy, sorafenib resistance, and aerobic glycolysis of HepG2 cells. Finally, in a liver cancer xenograft mouse model, we found that formed tumors with Snhg1-knocked-down HepG2 cells were more sensitive to sorafenib administration. Altogether, SNHG1 contributes to sorafenib resistance of liver cancer cells by promoting SND1-m6A-SLC7A11-mediated aerobic glycolysis.\n",

      "Cancer remains the most common lethal disease in the world. Although the treatment choices for cancer are still limited, significant progress has been made over the past few years. By improving targeted drug therapy, drug delivery systems promoted the therapeutic effects of anti-cancer medications. Exosome is a kind of natural nanoscale delivery system with natural substance transport properties, good biocompatibility, and high tumor targeting, which shows great potential in drug carriers, thereby providing novel strategies for cancer therapy. In this review, we present the formation, distribution, and characteristics of exosomes. Besides, extraction and isolation techniques are discussed. We focus on the recent progress and application of exosomes in cancer therapy in four aspects: exosome-mediated gene therapy, chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, and combination therapy. The current challenges and future developments of exosome-mediated cancer therapy are also discussed. Finally, the latest advances in the application of exosomes as drug delivery carriers in cancer therapy are summarized, which provide practical value and guidance for the development of cancer therapy.\n",
      "Alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, zinc-binding (AZGP1) is a secreted protein, which has been shown to be a potential biomarker of cancer progression; however, its roles in breast cancer are still unclear. Currently, we analyzed the online datasets and found that AZGP1 was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and its expression was negatively correlated with the survival of breast cancer patients. Functional experiments through AZGP1 knockdown revealed that AZGP1 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of breast cancer cells. In vivo experiments obtained a consistent result. Mechanistically, it was found that AZGP1 interacted with tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), which subsequently promoted AZGP1 degradation through facilitating the ubiquitination. Furthermore, overexpression of TRIM25 partially reversed the promoting effects of AZGP1 overexpression on breast cancer progression. Therefore, this study indicates that AZGP1 might be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.\n",
      "The poly(rC) binding protein 1 gene (PCBP1) encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNPE1), a nucleic acid-binding protein that plays a tumor-suppressive role in the mammary epithelium by regulating phenotypic plasticity and cell fate. Following the loss of PCBP1 function, the FAM3C gene (encoding the Interleukin-like EMT inducer, or \"ILEI\" protein) and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) gene are upregulated. Interaction between FAM3C and LIFR in the extracellular space induces phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3). Overexpression and/or hyperactivity of STAT3 has been detected in 40% of breast cancer cases and is associated with a poor prognosis. Herein, we characterize feed-forward regulation of LIFR expression in response to FAM3C/LIFR/STAT3 signaling in mammary epithelial cells. We show that PCBP1 upregulates LIFR transcription through activity at the LIFR promoter, and that FAM3C participates in transcriptional regulation of LIFR. Additionally, our bioinformatic analysis reveals a signature of transcriptional regulation associated with FAM3C/LIFR interaction and identifies the TWIST1 transcription factor as a downstream effector that participates in the maintenance of LIFR expression. Finally, we characterize the effect of LIFR expression in cell-based experiments that demonstrate the promotion of invasion, migration, and self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), consistent with previous studies linking LIFR expression to tumor initiation and metastasis in mammary epithelial cells.\n",
      "To overcome the limitations of in vitro two-dimensional (2D) cancer models in mimicking the complexities of the native tumor milieu, three-dimensional (3D) engineered cancer models using biomimetic materials have been introduced to more closely recapitulate the key attributes of the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, for colorectal cancer (CRC), a few studies have developed 3D engineered tumor models to investigate cell-cell interactions or efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. However, recapitulation of CRC cell line phenotypic differences within a 3D engineered matrix has not been systematically investigated. Here, we developed an in vitro 3D engineered CRC (3D-eCRC) tissue model using the natural-synthetic hybrid biomaterial PEG-fibrinogen and three CRC cell lines, HCT 116, HT-29, and SW480. To better recapitulate native tumor conditions, our 3D-eCRC model supported higher cell density encapsulation (20 × 10\n",

      "Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. Although many diagnostic and treatment regimens have been followed in the treatment for lung cancer, increasing mortality rate due to lung cancer is depressing and hence requires alternative plant based therapeutics with with less side-effects. Myrtenol exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Hence we intended to study the effect of Myrtenol on B(a)P-induced lung cancer. Our study showed that B(a)P lowered hematological count, decreased phagocyte and avidity indices, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction, levels of immunoglubulins, antioxidant levels, whereas Myrtenol treatment restored them back to normal levels. On the other hand, xenobiotic and liver dysfunction marker enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated on B(a)P exposure, which retuned back to normal by Myrtenol. This study thus describes the immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects of Myrtenol on B[a]P-induced immune destruction.\n",
      "Recurrent parosteal sarcomas with vascular involvement are rare and present unique challenges in their diagnosis and management. We report the case of a 21-year-old woman with parosteal osteosarcoma of the left distal femur, encasing the popliteal vessels. En bloc transarticular resection of the distal femur and popliteal vessels was performed, followed by reconstruction using a modular prosthesis and a saphenous vein autograft for both the artery and vein. On the 1st postoperative day, the patient developed an arterial thrombus requiring reintervention with a jump polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft. Histopathology confirmed parosteal osteosarcoma. After a disease-free survival of 41 months, the patient experienced local recurrence involving the PTFE graft, leading to graft compression, erosion, and subsequent thrombosis. Despite these complications, limb salvage was possible due to adequate collateral blood supply. This case highlights the feasibility of limb salvage surgery in select cases of parosteal osteosarcoma with vascular involvement.\n",
      "Cancer cells can alter glucose metabolism and regulate the expression of glucose transporters. Hepatoblastoma patients undergo cisplatin-based chemotherapy; however, 22.3% of patients develop cisplatin resistance and thus face a poor prognosis. We hypothesized that glucose transporters are associated with acquiring cisplatin resistance with increasing sugar intake inhibiting glucose transporters could reduce cisplatin resistance in hepatoblastoma patients.\n",
      "We established cisplatin-resistant HepG2 and HuH6 cells by continuous treatment with cisplatin. We evaluated the relationship between cisplatin resistance and glucose uptake. We used an expression array to select cisplatin-resistant associated glucose transporters and selected sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). We used dapagliflozin as an SGLT2 inhibitor and evaluated glucose uptake and IC50 after dapagliflozin treatment in wild-type and resistant hepatoblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo.\n",

      "Complete resection of an apicoposterior mediastinal mass is essential due to the mass effect, which exerts pressure on adjacent organs. Recently, the use of minimally invasive surgery has had many advantages. In this report, we describe a case in which a large apicoposterior mediastinal hypervascular mass was managed using a purse-string suture technique during robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). The patient, a 77-year-old woman, was diagnosed with a 6.2-cm apicoposterior mediastinal hypervascular solid mass originating from the branches of the right subclavian artery. The patient underwent RATS for treatment. To obtain an adequate view of the apex of the thoracic cavity, a needle aspiration was performed, followed by the application of a purse-string suture technique. This was done to reduce the size of the tumor and to prevent catastrophic events such as seeding or spillage of the cystic mass. The mass was histopathologically diagnosed as a schwannoma.

      "The discovery of lipid-hybrid nanosystems has offered potential solutions to various drug delivery and theranostic challenges. However, in many instances, the commonly used lipids and other components in these systems often pose challenges related to their solubility, physicochemical properties, immune compatibility, and limited synthetic tunability. In this work, we introduce a synthetically tunable supramolecular scaffold with amphiphilic characteristics based on the calix[4]arene macrocyclic system. We designed and synthesized two novel calix[4]arene-polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates, termed Cal-P1 and Cal-P2, and these were characterized utilizing a wide range of spectroscopic and analytical methods. The rational design of Cal-P1 and Cal-P2 demonstrates their utility in forming stable blended nanospheres with sustained drug release characteristics. The synergistic blending of PLGA and the calixarene scaffold (Cal-P1 and Cal-P2) in constructing long-lasting and controlled-release nanoparticles (NPs), which are optimized for encapsulating Nile Red dye, and their successful internalization and retention in HeLa cancer cells are demonstrated through in vitro assays. The potential of these NPs as sustained therapeutic carriers is investigated in vivo, showing improved retention compared to free dye with negligible toxicity. The successful design and construction of Cal-P1 and Cal-P2 nanosystems represent a new paradigm for addressing drug loading challenges, opening up opportunities for the development of highly efficient, synthetically tunable alternative adjuvants for drug encapsulation and delivery.\n",

The expected number of all-cause and cause-specific deaths was calculated using rates of the general population.\n",
      "During the follow-up period, 4310 women died. The age-standardised all-cause mortality ratio for the screening-detected cancer group was 1.41 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.37-1.46). A higher mortality ratio was observed for patients with clinically detected cancer: 2.27 (95% CI, 2.19-2.34). The observed versus expected breast cancer mortality ratio in the screening-detected patient group was 8.92 (95% CI, 8.45-9.40) and 20.23 (19.38-21.09) in the clinical group. Excess mortality was found for lung cancer in both patient groups, and small elevations for circulatory and respiratory disease in the clinically detected group.\n",

This study aims to determine if LVI is a predictor of cervical lymph node metastasis and/or recurrence in OSCC.\n",
      "We conducted a retrospective cohort review of patients from our institutional cancer registry who were treated for OSCC between 2004 and 2018. Patient demographics, surgical pathology results, and clinical outcome data were collected. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine if LVI was an independent predictor of cervical lymph node metastasis and/or recurrence.\n",
      "442 patients were included, 32.8% were female and median age at time of diagnosis was 61.2 years. LVI was present in 32.8% of patients.

      "The study included consecutive 2067 patients with solitary HCC who were treated with either ablation (N=1248) or surgery (N=819). The patients were divided into three groups based on the tumor size and compared the outcomes of the two therapies using propensity score matching.\n",
      "No significant difference in recurrence-free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS) was found between surgery and ablation groups for tumors measuring ≤2 cm or >2 cm but ≤3 cm. For tumors measuring >3 cm but ≤5 cm, RFS was significantly better with surgery than with ablation (3.6 and 2.0 years, respectively, p = 0.0297). However, no significant difference in OS was found between surgery and ablation in this group (6.7 and 6.0 years, respectively, p = 0.668).\n",
      "The study suggests that surgery and ablation can be equally used as a treatment for solitary HCC no more than 3 cm in diameter. For HCCs measuring 3-5 cm, the OS was not different between therapies; thus, ablation and less invasive therapy can be considered a treatment option; however, special caution should be taken to prevent recurrence.\n",

      "To estimate the ability of the International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA)-1 polynomial regression model to estimate the risk of endometrial cancer and other intracavitary uterine pathology in women without abnormal uterine bleeding.\n",
      "This is a retrospective study, in which we validated the IETA-1 model on the IETA-3 study cohort (n = 1745). IETA-3 is a prospective observational multicenter study. It includes women without vaginal bleeding who underwent a standardized transvaginal ultrasound examination in seven ultrasound centers from 2011 until 2018. The ultrasonography was performed either as part of routine gynecological examination, follow-up of non-endometrial pathology, in the workup before fertility treatment, or before treatment for uterine prolapse or ovarian pathology. Ultrasonographic findings were described using IETA terminology and were compared with histology or with results of clinical and ultrasound follow-up if endometrial sampling was not performed. The IETA-1 model, which was created using data from patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, predicts four histological outcomes: 1) endometrial cancer (EC) or endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), 2) endometrial polyp or intracavitary myoma, 3) hyperplasia without atypia, endometritis, or proliferative or secretory endometrium, and 4) endometrial atrophy. The predictors in the model are age, body mass index, and seven ultrasound variables (endometrial visibility, endometrial thickness, color score, cysts in the endometrium, non-uniform echogenicity of the endometrium, presence of a bright edge, presence of a single dominant vessel). We analyzed the discriminative ability of the model (area under the receiver operating curve, AUC; polytomous discrimination index, PDI) and evaluated calibration of its risk estimates (observed/expected ratio, O/E).\n",
      "The median age of the women in the IETA-3 cohort was 51 years (range: 20 - 85), and 51% (887/1745) of the women were postmenopausal. Histology showed EC or EIN in 29 (2%) women, endometrial polyps or intracavitary myomas in 1094 (63%), hyperplasia without atypia, endometritis, or proliferative or secretory endometrium in 144 (8%), and endometrial atrophy in 265 (15%) women. Insufficient material (n = 5, 0.3%) was classified as a separate benign outcome. For 208 (12%) women who did not undergo endometrial sampling but were followed up for at least 1 year without clinical or ultrasound signs of endometrial malignancy, the outcome was classified as benign. The IETA-1 model had an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73 - 0.89, n = 1745) for discrimination between EC/EIN and benign endometrium, and the O/E for EC/EIN was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.32 - 0.82). The AUC of the IETA-1 model to discriminate between endometrial atrophy and all other intracavitary uterine conditions was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95 - 0.98). The PDI of the model was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.62 - 0.73). Including only patients in whom the endometrium was measurable (n = 1689), the model's AUC was 0.83 (95%CI 0.75 - 0.91) versus 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52 - 0.73) when using endometrial thickness as the only predictor (difference in AUC 0.21, 95%CI: 0.08 - 0.32). For postmenopausal women with measurable endometrial thickness (n = 848), the IETA-1 model gave an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71 - 0.91) while the AUC for endometrial thickness was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.60 - 0.81) (difference in AUC 0.11, 95%CI: 0.01 - 0.20).\n",

An inhibitory tumor microenvironment was created when carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 expression was reduced, with decreased CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, dendritic cells, and B cells but increased cancer-associated fibroblasts. Methylation analysis showed that the abnormal decrease in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 might be caused by hypermethylation.

      "Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples from normal stomach, gastritis, intestinal metaplasia (IM), and gastric carcinoma were collected. Axin2 and β-catenin expression were evaluated using RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Histo-scores (H-scores) were calculated to quantify expression levels of Axin2. Associations between Axin2 expression and clinicopathological variables were examined.\n",
      "Axin2 expression was examined in normal stomach, gastritis, and IM tissues. Axin2 expression was mainly observed in the surface and isthmus areas in the normal stomach and gastritis, whereas Axin2 expression was markedly higher at the bases of IM.

It also aimed to determine the proportion of rural and metropolitan patients experiencing clinical levels of distress, and of these, the proportion who do not wish to access support.\n",
      "The study used a cross-sectional design. Two hundred and ninety-eight Australian cancer patients completed an online survey, including the Distress Thermometer and open-ended questions about reasons for declining support. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyse the data.\n",
      "More than half (56%) of participants reported experiencing clinically significant levels of distress. Of these, almost half (47%) declined psychosocial support. Content analysis of reasons for declining psychosocial support resulted in six main concepts: I don't need support; I'm using personal resources to cope; negative perceptions and attitudes; life doesn't stop for cancer; I'm focussed on fighting cancer; and systemic barriers. Rural cancer patients most often indicated using personal resources to cope, while metropolitan participants most commonly indicated not needing support. A range of subconcepts were also identified. Perceiving distress as manageable or transient was almost exclusively reported by metropolitan participants, while stigma was almost exclusively reported by rural participants.\n",
      "The findings provided greater depth of insight into reasons cancer patients decline psychosocial support and identified several qualitative differences in the reasons provided by metropolitan and rural patients. Recommendations are provided for clinicians, in particular for clinicians who work with rural cancer patients and their supporters.\n",

      "The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE or AGER) is a transmembrane, immunoglobulin-like receptor that, due to its multiple isoform structures, binds to a diverse range of endo- and exogenous ligands. RAGE activation caused by the ligand binding initiates a cascade of complex pathways associated with producing free radicals, such as reactive nitric oxide and oxygen species, cell proliferation, and immunoinflammatory processes. The involvement of RAGE in the pathogenesis of disorders such as diabetes, inflammation, tumor progression, and endothelial dysfunction is dictated by the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) at pathologic states leading to sustained RAGE upregulation. The involvement of RAGE and its ligands in numerous pathologies and diseases makes RAGE an interesting target for therapy focused on the modulation of both RAGE expression or activation and the production or exogenous administration of AGEs. Despite the known role that the RAGE/AGE axis plays in multiple disease states, there remains an urgent need to develop noninvasive, molecular imaging approaches that can accurately quantify RAGE levels in vivo that will aid in the validation of RAGE and its ligands as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Based on Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory, we aimed to identify profiles based on two distinct resources: sense of hope (personal resource) and perceived social support (social resource). Both have been found to be vital for optimal functioning during adolescence. Further, we examined differences in these profiles with regard to two distal outcomes: normalization (a coping strategy) and search for meaning in life (a commonly assumed adolescent developmental task).\n",

      "The study outcomes highlight the essential role of resources for this population. Such resources seem to be helpful for normalization, a coping strategy whose focus is on facilitating regular family routines, and for the siblings' search for meaning in life.

      "A total of 303 patients were included in the study (prepandemic=163, pandemic=140). The time from the symptom onset to the histological diagnosis was shorter in the pandemic group (p=0.005). T4 tumours were more common in the prepandemic group (p=0.01). Most patients with adenocarcinoma underwent lobectomy, and most patients with pneumonectomy had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histology (p=0.001). The indications for chemotherapy and radiotherapy significantly differed between the groups (p=0.005 and p=0.001, respectively).

      "The mTOR pathway plays critical roles in intrinsic chemoresistance by regulating FANCD2 expression; however, the underlying mechanisms by which mTOR regulates FANCD2 expression and related inhibitors have not been clearly elucidated. We previously demonstrated that Centipeda minima (C. minima) extracts exert promising chemosensitizing effects by inhibiting FANCD2 activity. Herein, we aimed to identify the bioactive chemosensitizer in C. minima and elucidate its underlying mechanism.\n",
      "The chemosensitizing effects of arnicolide C (ArC), a bioactive compound in C. minima, on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were investigated using immunoblotting, immunofluoresence, flow cytometry, the comet assay, siRNA transfection, and animal models. The online SynergyFinder software was used to determine the synergistic effects of ArC and chemotherapeutic drugs on NSCLC cells.\n",
      "In this study, we found that ArC had synergistic cytotoxic effects with DNA cross-linking drugs such as cisplatin (CDDP) and mitomycin C (MMC) in NSCLC cells. ArC treatment markedly decreased FANCD2 expression in NSCLC cells, thus attenuating CDDP-induced FANCD2 nuclear foci formation, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis. Furthermore, ArC inhibited the mTOR pathway and significantly attenuated mTOR-mediated expression of E2F1, a critical transcription factor of FANCD2. Moreover, co-administration of ArC and CDDP exerted a synergistic anticancer effect in a A549 xenograft mouse model by suppressing mTOR/FANCD2 signaling in tumor tissues.\n",
      "These findings demonstrate that ArC suppresses DNA cross-linking drug-induced DNA damage response by inhibiting the mTOR/E2F1/FANCD2 signaling axis, serving as a chemosensitizing agent. This provides insight into the anticancer mechanisms of ArC and offers a potential combinatorial anticancer therapeutic strategy.\n",
      "The recurrence site that influences post-recurrence survival (PRS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing surgery and the preoperative predictors of recurrence remain unclear.\n",
      "Cohorts 1 and 2 had 4520 (who underwent complete resection for p-stage 0-IIIA NSCLC) and 727 (who experienced recurrence after surgery) patients, respectively. The initial sites of recurrence were the lungs (309 cases), thoracic lymph nodes (225 cases), pleura (112 cases), bone (110 cases), central nervous system (86 cases), adrenal gland (25 cases), abdomen (60 cases), cervical and axillary lymph nodes (38 cases), chest wall (13 cases), skin (5 cases), and eye and tongue (3 cases). For cohort 2 analysis, the initial recurrence site that resulted in poor PRS was analyzed by multivariable analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model. For cohort 1 analysis, the preoperative predictors of recurrence patterns with poor PRS were analyzed by multivariable analysis using a logistic regression model.\n",
      "In cohort 2 analysis, recurrence in the central nervous system (hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; p < 0.001), bone (HR, 1.75; p < 0.001), abdomen (HR, 2.39; p < 0.001), and pleura (HR, 1.69; p < 0.001) were independent poor prognostic recurrent sites for PRS and they were high-risk sites (HRS). Intrathoracic lymph nodes, cervical and axillary lymph nodes, lungs, chest wall, adrenal gland, eye and tongue, and skin were low-risk sites (LRS) that did not affect PRS. Patients with multiple LRS without HRS recurrence had a worse prognosis than those with a single LRS without HRS recurrence (5-year PRS 20.2% vs. 37.7%, p < 0.001) and were comparable to those with HRS recurrence (p = 1.000). In cohort 1 analysis, preoperative predictors for HRS and multiple LRS recurrences were positron emission tomography (PET) maximum standardized uptake value (maxSUV) ≥ 3.2 (HR, 5.09; p < 0.001), clinical nodal metastasis (HR, 2.00; p < 0.001), tumor size ≥ 2.4 cm (HR, 1.96; p < 0.001) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ≥ 5 ng/ml (HR, 1.41; p = 0.004). The cumulative incidence rates of HRS and multiple LRS recurrences within 5 years were 55.9%, 40.9%, 26.3%, 11.1%, and 3.5% (p < 0.001) in patients with 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0 of the above risks, respectively.\n",

      "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is an important factor that regulates the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the main mesenchymal cells in the TME and play a vital role in tumor progression; however, the specific underlying mechanisms require further study.\n",
      "Multiple single-cell and transcriptome data were analyzed and validated. Primary CAFs isolation, CCK8 assay, co-culture assay, western blotting, multiple immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, ChIP, double luciferase, and animal experiments were used to explore the potential mechanism of MYL9 regulation in CRC.\n",
      "Our findings revealed that MYL9 was predominantly localized and expressed in CAFs rather than in CRC cells, and bioinformatics analysis revealed that high MYL9 expression was strongly associated with poor overall and disease-free survival in various tumors. In addition, high MYL9 expression is closely associated with M2 macrophage infiltration, which can lead to an immunosuppressive microenvironment in CRC, making it insensitive to immunotherapy. Mechanically, MYL9 can regulate the secretion of CAFs on CCL2 and TGF-β1, thus affecting the immune microenvironment and progression of CRC. In addition, MYL9 bounded with IQGAP1 to regulate CCL2 and TGF-β1 secretion through the ERK 1/2 pathway, and CCL2 and TGF-β1 synergistically promoted CRC cells progression through the PI3K-AKT pathway. Furthermore, MYL9 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC. During the upstream regulation of MYL9 in CAFs, we found that the EMT transcription factor ZEB1 could bind to the MYL9 promoter in CAFs, enhancing the activity and function of MYL9. Therefore, MYL9 is predominantly expressed in CAFs and can indirectly influence tumor biology and EMT by affecting CAFs protein expression in CRC.\n",
      "MYL9 regulates the secretion of cytokines and chemokines in CAFs, which can affect the immune microenvironment of CRC and promote CRC progression. The relationship between MYL9 expression and CRC clinical staging and immunotherapy is closer in CAFs than in tumor cells; therefore, studies using CAFs as a model deserve more attention when exploring tumor molecular targets in clinical research.\n",
      "Information about survival outcomes in metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC) is sparse, and the numbers often quoted are based on reports of clinical trials data that may not be representative of patients treated in the real world. Furthermore, the impact of more widespread adoption of a standardized combination chemotherapy regimen since 2010 on survival is unclear.\n",
      "We performed an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to determine the real-world overall survival trends in a cohort of patients with metastatic BTC diagnosed between the years 2000 and 2017 with follow-up until 2018. We analyzed data for the entire cohort, evaluated short-term and long-term survival rates, and compared survival outcomes in the pre-2010 and post-2010 periods. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate factors associated with survival.\n",
      "Among 13, 287 patients, the median age was 68 years. There was a preponderance of female (57%) and white (77%) patients. Forty-one percent died within 3 months of diagnosis (short-term survivors) and 20% were long-term survivors (12 months or longer). The median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 4.5 months. Median OS improved post-2010 (4.5 months) compared to pre-2010 (3.5 months) (\n",
      "The real-world prognosis of metastatic BTC is remarkably poorer than described in clinical trials because a large proportion of patients survive less than three months. Over the last decade, the improvement in survival has been minimal.\n",
      "Overall survival is the \"gold standard\" endpoint in cancer clinical trials. It plays a key role in determining the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of a new intervention and whether it is recommended for use in standard of care. The assessment of overall survival usually requires trial participants to be followed up for a long period of time. In this time, they may stop receiving the trial intervention and receive subsequent anti-cancer treatments, which also aim to extend survival, during trial follow-up. This can potentially change the interpretation of overall survival in the context of the clinical trial. This review aimed to determine how overall survival has been assessed in cancer clinical trials and whether subsequent anti-cancer treatments are considered.\n",
      "Two searches were conducted using MEDLINE within OVID© on the 9th of November 2021. The first sought to identify papers publishing overall survival results from randomised controlled trials in eight reputable journals and the second to identify papers mentioning or considering subsequent treatments. Papers published since 2010 were included if presenting or discussing overall survival in the context of treating cancer.\n",
      "One hundred and thirty-four papers were included. The majority of these were presenting clinical trial results (98, 73%). Of these, 45 (46%) reported overall survival as a (co-) primary endpoint. A lower proportion of papers including overall survival as a (co-) primary endpoint compared to a secondary endpoint were published in recent years. The primary analysis of overall survival varied across the papers. Fifty-nine (60%) mentioned subsequent treatments. Seven papers performed additional analysis, primarily when patients in the control arm received the experimental treatment during trial follow-up (treatment switching).\n",
      "Overall survival has steadily moved from being the primary to a secondary endpoint. However, it is still of interest with papers presenting overall survival results with the caveat of subsequent treatments, but little or no investigation into their effect. This review shows that there is a methodological gap for what researchers should do when trial participants receive anti-cancer treatment during trial follow-up. Future research will identify the stakeholder opinions, on how this methodological gap should be addressed.\n",
      "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide, especially for patients who are suffering from end-stage liver disease (ESLD). The ESLD is considered a great challenge for clinicians due to the limited chance for liver transplantation, which is the only curative treatment for those patients. Stem cell-based therapy as a part of regenerative medicine represents a promising application for ESLD patients. Many clinical trials were performed to assess the utility of bone marrow-derived stem cells as a potential therapy for patients with liver diseases. The aim of the present study is to present and review the various types of stem cell-based therapy, including the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), BM-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs), CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and cancer stem cells.Though this type of therapy achieved promising results for the treatment of ESLD, however still there is a confounding data regarding its clinical application. A large body of evidence is highly required to evaluate the stem cell-based therapy after long-term follow-up, with respect to the incidence of toxicity, immunogenicity, and tumorigenesis that developed in many patients.\n",
      "Cells are highly dynamic and adopt variable shapes and sizes. These variations are biologically important but challenging to investigate in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. Micropatterning, confining cells on microfabricated substrates with defined geometries and molecular compositions, is a powerful tool for controlling cell shape and interactions. However, conventional binary micropatterns are static and fail to address dynamic changes in cell polarity, spreading, and migration. Here, a method for dynamic micropatterning is reported, where the non-adhesive surface surrounding adhesive micropatterns is rapidly converted to support specific cell-matrix interactions while allowing simultaneous imaging of the cells. The technique is based on ultraviolet photopatterning of biotinylated polyethylene glycol-grafted poly-L-lysine, and it is simple, inexpensive, and compatible with a wide range of streptavidin-conjugated ligands. Experiments using biotinylation-based dynamic micropatterns reveal that distinct extracellular matrix ligands and bivalent integrin-clustering antibodies support different degrees of front-rear polarity in human glioblastoma cells, which correlates to altered directionality and persistence upon release and migration on fibronectin. Unexpectedly, however, neither an asymmetric cell shape nor centrosome orientation can fully predict the future direction of migration. Taken together, biotinylation-based dynamic micropatterns allow easily accessible and highly customizable control over cell morphology and motility.\n",
      "Abdominal cancers continue to pose daily challenges to clinicians, radiologists and researchers. These challenges are faced at each stage of abdominal cancer management, including early detection, accurate characterization, precise assessment of tumor spread, preoperative planning when surgery is anticipated, prediction of tumor aggressiveness, response to therapy, and detection of recurrence. Technical advances in medical imaging, often in combination with imaging biomarkers, show great promise in addressing such challenges. Information extracted from imaging datasets owing to the application of radiomics can be used to further improve the diagnostic capabilities of imaging. However, the analysis of the huge amount of data provided by these advances is a difficult task in daily practice. Artificial intelligence has the potential to help radiologists in all these challenges. Notably, the applications of AI in the field of abdominal cancers are expanding and now include diverse approaches for cancer detection, diagnosis and classification, genomics and detection of genetic alterations, analysis of tumor microenvironment, identification of predictive biomarkers and follow-up. However, AI currently has some limitations that need further refinement for implementation in the clinical setting. This review article sums up recent advances in imaging of abdominal cancers in the field of image/data acquisition, tumor detection, tumor characterization, prognosis, and treatment response evaluation.\n",

This study aimed to replicate and extend previous work by (1) characterizing the trajectories of depressive symptoms from 3 to 12 months after the loss of a spouse, (2) examining whether (a) childhood maltreatment and attachment style predicted distinct depression trajectories, and (b) different depression trajectories were associated with the risk of prolonged grief at 12 months post-loss. Recently bereaved individuals (N = 175) completed self-report assessments at 3, 4, 6, and 12-months post-loss. Trajectories of depressive symptoms were estimated using group-based trajectory modelling. Four distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified: (1) resilience (minimal/no depression across time points; 45%), (2) moderate depression-improved (alleviated to 'mild' by 12 months; 31%), (3) severe depression-improved (alleviated to 'moderate' by 12 months; 15%), and (4) chronic depression ('severe' symptoms across time points; 9%). Higher childhood maltreatment predicted a greater likelihood of belonging to the 'severe depression-improved' and 'chronic depression' groups than the 'resilient' and 'moderate depression-improved' groups. Widow(er)s with higher attachment anxiety were more likely to belong to the 'severe depression-improved' and 'chronic depression' groups than the 'resilient' group. The trajectory groups with persistent levels of depressive symptoms up until 6 months were more likely to exhibit prolonged grief at 12 months post-loss. Changes from pre-loss functioning cannot be estimated. Our findings provide insight into the early identification of post-loss prolonged grief.\n",

The levels of long non-coding RNA-GNAS-AS1, miR-34a-5p, glycolysis-related proteins, and Ras homolog gene family (RhoA)/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling-related proteins were detected by qRT-PCR or western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. Glycolysis levels were measured by assay kits. GNAS-AS1 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification level was detected by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing. The combined targets of miR-34a-5p were validated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. BALB/C nude mice were selected for subcutaneous tumor validation. Chidamide at a dosage of 25 mg/kg was used in the animal study.\n",
      "GNAS-AS1 promoted glycolysis in AML cells by upregulating the expression of glycolysis-related proteins and increasing glucose consumption, lactate production, ATP generation, and the extracellular acidification rate. Chidamide treatment suppressed WT1-associated protein (WTAP)-mediated RNA m6A modification of GNAS-AS1. Chidamide downregulated GNAS-AS1 to inhibit glycolysis in AML cells. GNAS-AS1 targeted miR-34a-5p to promote insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein (IGF2BP2) expression. IGF2BP2 inhibition reversed the promoting effect of miR-34a-5p knockdown on glycolysis and RhoA/ROCK pathway in Chidamide-treated cells.

Clinical and pathological reports were used to collect the data. A methodology based on distributional random forest was developed to predict the ODX score classes (ODX [Formula: see text] and ODX [Formula: see text]) using 9 clinico-pathological characteristics. This methodology can be used particularly to identify the patients of the training cohort that share similarities with the new patient and to predict an estimate of the distribution of the ODX score.\n",
      "The mean age of participants is 56.9 years old. We have correctly classified [Formula: see text] of patients in low risk and [Formula: see text] of patients in high risk. The overall accuracy is [Formula: see text]. The proportion of low risk correct predicted value (PPV) is [Formula: see text]. The percentage of high risk correct predicted value (NPV) is approximately [Formula: see text]. The F1-score and the Area Under Curve (AUC) are of 0.87 and 0.759, respectively.\n",

      "Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant tumor with high incidence rate and mortality. Due to the lack of effective diagnostic indicators, most patients are diagnosed in late stage and have a poor prognosis. An increasing number of studies have proved that Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) can play an oncogene role in various cancer types. However, the precise mechanism of PPIA in GC is still unclear. Herein, we analyzed the mRNA levels of PPIA in pan-cancer. The prognostic value of PPIA on GC was also evaluated using multiple databases. Additionally, the relationship between PPIA expression and clinical factors in GC was also examined. We further confirmed that PPIA expression was not affected by genetic alteration and DNA methylation. Moreover, the upstream regulator miRNA and lncRNA of PPIA were identified, which suggested that LINC10232/miRNA-204-5p/PPIA axis might act as a potential biological pathway in GC. Finally, this study revealed that PPIA was negatively correlated with immune checkpoint expression, immune cell biomarkers, and immune cell infiltration in GC.\n",
      "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumors are made up of distinct cell subpopulations, including neuroendocrine (NE) and non-neuroendocrine (non-NE) cells. While secreted factors from non-NE SCLC cells have been shown to support the growth of the NE cells, the underlying molecular factors are not well understood. Here, we show that exosome-type small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) secreted from non-NE SCLC cells promote adhesion and survival of NE SCLC cells. Proteomic analysis of purified SEVs revealed that extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and integrins are highly enriched in SEVs of non-NE cells whereas nucleic acid-binding proteins are enriched in SEVs purified from NE cells. Addition of select purified ECM proteins identified in purified extracellular vesicles (EVs), specifically fibronectin, laminin 411, and laminin 511, were able to substitute for the role of non-NE-derived SEVs in promoting adhesion and survival of NE SCLC cells. Those same proteins were differentially expressed by human SCLC subtypes. These data suggest that ECM-carrying SEVs secreted by non-NE cells play a key role in supporting the growth and survival of NE SCLC cells.\n",

Using the RAWM, each rat was assessed for learning and memory performance through two sets of six trials separated by a 5-min rest period evaluating both short- and long-term effects on memory.\n",
      "There was no deficit in learning or long-term memory in both drug groups compared to control. However, rats in both drug groups made significantly more errors in all short-term memory trials. This effect was mitigated when Vit. E was co-administered with either drug. Moreover, PAC (but not DOX) induced hippocampal lipid peroxidation by increasing the levels of standard biomarker thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Interestingly, Vit. E prevented PAC-induced hippocampal oxidative stress. Furthermore, both DOX and PAC were correlated with reduction in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression levels in the hippocampus, which was overcome by the co-administration of Vit. E.\n",

      "204 eligible patients with SCLC were respectively included and categorized into three groups (no, mild, and severe myelosuppression) based on myelosuppression degree after the first chemotherapy. Curative efficacy of 2-cycle chemotherapy was evaluated by the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate their association. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to assess the predictive ability of myelosuppression.\n",
      "In the fully-adjusted model, mild (OR, 4.61; 95% CI, 1.35 to 18.27; P = 0.020) and severe (OR, 7.22; 95% CI, 1.30 to 72.44; P = 0.046) myelosuppression were positively associated with DCR. However, only mild myelosuppression was significantly associated with ORR (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.30 to 6.14; P = 0.010). Although we observed evidence of increased ORR in severe myelosuppression, the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, based on the results of the ROC curve, NRI and IDI, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression cannot be used as a accurate and independent predictor for curative efficacy, but it can improve overall prediction accuracy.\n",

There was a significant association between infectious diarrhoea within 1 year post-transplant and the occurrence of severe acute lower gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD, OR = 4.64, 95% CI 2.57-8.38, p < 0.001) and inferior GVHD-free, relapse-free survival on analysis adjusted for age, donor type, stem cell source and T-cell depletion (aHR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.18-2.27, p = 0.003). When the classes of infectious diarrhoea were compared to no infection, bacterial (OR = 6.38, 95% CI 1.90-21.40, p = 0.003), CDI (OR = 3.80, 95% CI 1.91-7.53, p < 0.001) and multiple infections (OR = 11.16, 95% CI 2.84-43.92, p < 0.001) were all independently associated with a higher risk of severe GI GVHD. Conversely, viral infections were not (OR = 2.98, 95% CI 0.57-15.43, p = 0.20). Non-viral infectious diarrhoea is significantly associated with the development of GVHD. Research to examine whether the prevention of infectious diarrhoea via infection control measures or modulation of the microbiome reduces the incidence of GVHD is needed.\n",
      "Since HMAs were recommended for treatments in AML and MDS, we wondered whether HMAs could provide similar benefit to AML and intermediate/high-risk MDS under the direction of next-generation sequencing. Here we retrospectively analyzed the prognosis of 176 AML and 128 intermediate/high-risk MDS patients treated with HMAs or non-HMA regimens. For AML, HMAs regimen was related to better CR rate compared with non-HMA regimen in elder cohort, while the situation was the opposite in younger cohort. In consolidation phase, EMM (+) patients could benefit from HMAs regimen. Relapsed AML patients receiving HMAs regimen rather than non-HMA regimen had better post-relapse survival. Multivariate analysis identified HMA regimen as an independent prognostic factor for OS in EMM (+) cohort. For intermediate/high-risk MDS patients not undergoing HSCT, however, HMA regimen showed no survival advantage in EMM (+) cohort and was conversely associated with shorter survival in EMM (-) cohort compared with non-HMA regimen. And among those undergoing HSCT, HMA prior to HSCT predicted poor prognosis compared with upfront HSCT regardless of the existence of EMMs. Therefore, HMAs had better therapeutic value in AML rather than in intermediate/high-risk MDS based on EMMs.\n",

      "Sixty-eight consecutive patients with node-negative sinonasal SCC (January 2005-December 2020) were enrolled, allocated to the training (n = 47) and test sets (n = 21). Early local failure, which occurred within 12 months of completion of initial treatment, was the primary endpoint. For clinical features (age, location, treatment modality, and clinical T stage), binary logistic regression analysis was performed. For 186 extracted radiomic features, different feature selections and classifiers were combined to create two prediction models: (1) a pure radiomics model; and (2) a combined model with clinical features and radiomics. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were calculated and compared using DeLong's method.\n",
      "Early local failure occurred in 38.3% (18/47) and 23.8% (5/21) in the training and test sets, respectively.

      "A total of 116 quantitative shape features, including 56 geometric moments and 60 bounding shape features, were defined. The tracheal lumen was semi-automatically defined with a CT threshold of less than - 500 HU. Three contiguous slices with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd smallest trachea lumen areas were contiguously selected, and the appropriate number of slices to be included was determined. Fifty-six patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) invading the trachea and 22 patients with DTC but without invasion were retrospectively included.

      "A combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy has been proposed to have better clinical outcomes in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC). On the other hand, chemotherapeutics is known to have certain unwanted effects on the tumor microenvironment that may mask the expected beneficial effects of immunotherapy. Here, we have investigated the effect of gemcitabine (GEM), on two immune checkpoint proteins (PD-L1 and PD-L2) expression in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs). Findings of in vitro studies conducted by using in-culture activated mouse pancreatic stellate cells (mPSCs) and human PDAC patients derived CAFs demonstrated that GEM significantly induces PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in these cells. Moreover, GEM induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and production of multiple known PD-L1-inducing secretory proteins including IFN-γ in CAFs. Upregulation of PD-L1 in PSCs/CAFs upon GEM treatment caused T cell inactivation and apoptosis in vitro. Importantly, Statins suppressed GEM-induced PD-L1 expression both in CAFs and PCCs while abrogating the inactivation of T-cells caused by GEM-treated PSCs/CAFs. Finally, in an immunocompetent syngeneic orthotopic mouse pancreatic tumor model, simvastatin and GEM combination therapy significantly reduced intra-tumor PD-L1 expression and noticeably reduced the overall tumor burden and metastasis incidence. Together, the findings of this study have provided experimental evidence that illustrates potential unwanted side effects of GEM that could hamper the effectiveness of this drug as mono and/or combination therapy. At the same time the findings also suggest use of statins along with GEM will help in overcoming these shortcomings and warrant further clinical investigation.\n",
      "BET proteins, which influence gene expression and contribute to the development of cancer, are epigenetic interpreters. Thus, BET inhibitors represent a novel form of epigenetic anticancer treatment. Although preliminary clinical trials have shown the anticancer potential of BET inhibitors, it appears that these drugs have limited effectiveness when used alone. Therefore, given the limited monotherapeutic activity of BET inhibitors, their use in combination with other drugs warrants attention, including the meaningful variations in pharmacodynamic activity among chosen drug combinations. In this paper, we review the function of BET proteins, the preclinical justification for BET protein targeting in cancer, recent advances in small-molecule BET inhibitors, and preliminary clinical trial findings. We elucidate BET inhibitor resistance mechanisms, shed light on the associated adverse events, investigate the potential of combining these inhibitors with diverse therapeutic agents, present a comprehensive compilation of synergistic treatments involving BET inhibitors, and provide an outlook on their future prospects as potent antitumor agents. We conclude by suggesting that combining BET inhibitors with other anticancer drugs and innovative next-generation agents holds great potential for advancing the effective targeting of BET proteins as a promising anticancer strategy.\n",
      "ATP2B1 encodes plasma membrane calcium-transporting-ATPase1 and plays an essential role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis that regulates diverse signaling pathways.

      "Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON, MST1R) is a single-span transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) aberrantly expressed in numerous cancers, including various solid tumors. How naturally occurring splicing isoforms of RON, especially those which are constitutively activated, affect tumorigenesis and therapeutic response, is largely unknown. Here, we identified that presence of activated RON could be a possible factor for the development of resistance against anti-EGFR (cetuximab) therapy in colorectal cancer patient tissues. Also, we elucidated the roles of three splicing variants of RON, RON Δ155, Δ160, and Δ165 as tumor drivers in cancer cell lines. Subsequently, we designed an inhibitor of RON, WM-S1-030, to suppress phosphorylation thereby inhibiting the activation of the three RON variants as well as the wild type. Specifically, WM-S1-030 treatment led to potent regression of tumor growth in solid tumors expressing the RON variants Δ155, Δ160, and Δ165. Two mechanisms for the RON oncogenic activity depending on KRAS genotype was evaluated in our study which include activation of EGFR and Src, in a trimeric complex, and stabilization of the beta-catenin. In terms of the immunotherapy, WM-S1-030 elicited notable antitumor immunity in anti-PD-1 resistant cell derived mouse model, likely via repression of M1/M2 polarization of macrophages. These findings suggest that WM-S1-030 could be developed as a new treatment option for cancer patients expressing these three RON variants.\n",
      "Recent findings position the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E as a novel modulator of mRNA splicing, a process that impacts the form and function of resultant proteins. eIF4E physically interacts with the spliceosome and with some intron-containing transcripts implying a direct role in some splicing events. Moreover, eIF4E drives the production of key components of the splicing machinery underpinning larger scale impacts on splicing. These drive eIF4E-dependent reprogramming of the splicing signature. This work completes a series of studies demonstrating eIF4E acts in all the major mRNA maturation steps whereby eIF4E drives production of the RNA processing machinery and escorts some transcripts through various maturation steps. In this way, eIF4E couples the mRNA processing-export-translation axis linking nuclear mRNA processing to cytoplasmic translation. eIF4E elevation is linked to worse outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia patients where these activities are dysregulated. Understanding these effects provides new insight into post-transcriptional control and eIF4E-driven cancers.\n",
      "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) influence cell phenotypes and functions via protein, nucleic acid, and lipid cargoes. EVs are heterogeneous, due to diverse biogenesis mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Our previous study revealed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane contact site (MCS) linker protein vesicle associated protein associated protein A (VAP-A) drives biogenesis of a subset of RNA-enriched EVs. Here, we examine the protein content of VAP-A-regulated EVs. Using label-free proteomics, we identified down- and upregulated proteins in small EVs (SEVs) purified from VAP-A knockdown (KD) colon cancer cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the data revealed protein classes that are differentially sorted to SEVs dependent on VAP-A. Search Tool for the Retrieval of Reciprocity Genes (STRING) protein-protein interaction network analysis of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) gene set identified several RNA functional machineries that are downregulated in VAP-A KD SEVs, including ribosome, spliceosome, mRNA surveillance, and RNA transport proteins. We also observed downregulation of other functionally interacting protein networks, including cadherin-binding, unfolded protein binding, and ATP-dependent proteins.\n",
      "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemical-based treatment approach that involves using light to activate photosensitizers (PSs). Attractively, PDT is one of the alternative cancer treatments due to its noninvasive technique. By utilizing the heavy atom effect, this work modified a class of formazan dyes to improve intersystem crossing (ISC) with the goal of improving reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for PDT treatment. Two methods were used to observe the ROS generation enhanced by ISC of the synthesized complexes including, (1) recording DPBF decomposition caused by the ROS, and (2) calculating the potential energy curves for photophysical mechanisms of BF2-formazanate dyes using the DFT and nudged elastic band (NEB) methods. The photophysical properties of the dyes were studied using spectroscopic techniques and X-ray crystallography, as well as DFT calculations. The experimental and theoretical results and in vitro cellular assays confirmed the potential use of the newly synthesized iodinated BF2-formazanate dyes in PDT.\n",
      "The therapeutic potential of G-quadruplexes has increased significantly with the growing understanding of its functional roles in pathogens apart from human diseases such as cancer. Here, we report the synthesis of three julolidine-based molecules and their binding to nucleic acids. Among the synthesized molecules, compound 1 exhibited red emissive fluorescence with a distinct preference for Pu22 G-quadruplex. The binding of compound 1 to Pu22 G-quadruplex, initially identified through a fluorescence-based screening, was further confirmed by UV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism-based experiments. Thermal denaturation of compound 1 in the presence of Pu22 G-quadruplex revealed a concentration-dependent stabilization (~ 10.0 °C at 1:3 stoichiometry).  Fluorescence-based experiments revealed 1:1 stoichiometry of the interaction and an association constant (Ka) of 5.67 × 106 M-1. CD experiments displayed that the parallel conformation of the G-quadruplex was retained on compound 1's binding and signs of higher order binding/complex formation were observed at high compound 1 to DNA ratio. Molecular docking studies revealed the dominance of stacking and van der Waals interactions in the molecular recognition which was aided by some close-distance interactions involving the quinolinium nitrogen atom.\n",

      "Maintenance of genome stability relies on functional centromeres for correct chromosome segregation and faithful inheritance of the genetic information. The human centromere is the primary constriction within mitotic chromosomes made up of repetitive alpha-satellite DNA hierarchically organized in megabase-long arrays of near-identical higher order repeats (HORs). Centromeres are epigenetically specified by the presence of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A, which enables the assembly of the kinetochore for microtubule attachment. Notably, centromeric DNA is faithfully inherited as intact haplotypes from the parents to the offspring without intervening recombination, yet, outside of meiosis, centromeres are akin to common fragile sites (CFSs), manifesting crossing-overs and ongoing sequence instability. Consequences of DNA changes within the centromere are just starting to emerge, with unclear effects on intra- and inter-generational inheritance driven by centromere's essential role in kinetochore assembly. Here, we review evidence of meiotic selection operating to mitigate centromere drive, as well as recent reports on centromere damage, recombination and repair during the mitotic cell division. We propose an antagonistic pleiotropy interpretation to reconcile centromere DNA instability as both driver of aneuploidy that underlies degenerative diseases, while also potentially necessary for the maintenance of homogenized HORs for centromere function. We attempt to provide a framework for this conceptual leap taking into consideration the structural interface of centromere-kinetochore interaction and present case scenarios for its malfunctioning. Finally, we offer an integrated working model to connect DNA instability, chromatin, and structural changes with functional consequences on chromosome integrity.\n",
      "Intraoperative specimen radiography is a routinely used procedure to ensure adequate resection of non-palpable breast tumors. Intraoperative digital specimen mammography (IDSM) is an alternative to conventional specimen radiography (CSR) which provides immediate specimen evaluation and can potentially decrease operation time. IDSM may also result in lower positive margin and re-excision rates. IDSM was implemented in our hospital in 2018. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of using IDSM versus CSR on operation time, margin status and re-excision rates in breast conserving surgery.\n",
      "The present study is a single-center retrospective cohort study with 2 patient cohorts: one which underwent CSR (n = 532) and one which underwent IDSM (n = 475). The primary outcome was the operation time. Secondary outcomes were the margin status of the primary surgery, the cavity shaving rate, and the re-excision rate. Differences between cohorts were compared using univariate statistics and multiple regression analyses to adjust for variables that were significantly different between the groups.\n",
      "IDSM use was associated with an 8-minute reduction in surgery time (B = -8.034, 95% CI [-11.6, -4.5]; P < .001). Treatment variables independently associated with the operation time included use of IDSM, type of surgery, and performance of cavity shaving. Cavity shaves were more often performed when IDSM was used (24% for IDSM vs. 14% for CSR, P < .001), while the proportion of negative margin rates (93% for IDSM vs. 96% for CSR, P = .070) was comparable.\n",

      "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is crucial for breast cancer diagnosis, classification, and individualized treatment. IHC is used to measure the levels of expression of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and other biomarkers, which are used to make treatment decisions and predict how well a patient will do. The evaluation of the breast cancer score on IHC slides, taking into account structural and morphological features as well as a scarcity of relevant data, is one of the most important issues in the IHC debate. Several recent studies have utilized machine learning and deep learning techniques to resolve these issues.\n",

Participants were asked to answer questions related to their knowledge and experience with artificial intelligence, as well as their opinions of potential use of ChatGPT/LLMs in research and clinical practice.\n",
      "Data are reported as the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables, and the frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Charts and tables are used as appropriate, with descriptions of the chart types and the measures used. The data are reported in accordance with the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES).\n",
      "A total of 456 individuals completed the survey (64% completion rate). Nearly half (47.7%) reported that they use ChatGPT/LLMs in their academic practice, with fewer using the technology in clinical practice (19.8%). More than half (62.2%) believe there are potential ethical concerns when using ChatGPT for scientific or academic writing, and 53% reported that they have experienced limitations when using ChatGPT in academic practice.\n",
      "Urologists recognise the potential of ChatGPT/LLMs in research but have concerns regarding ethics and patient acceptance. There is a desire for regulations and guidelines to ensure appropriate use. In addition, measures should be taken to establish rules and guidelines to maximise safety and efficiency when using this novel technology.\n",

      "The European Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom (BSS Directive) includes optimisation of treatment with radiotherapeutic procedures based on patient dosimetry and verification of the absorbed doses delivered. The present policy statement summarises aspects of three directives relating to the therapeutic use of radiopharmaceuticals and medical devices, and outlines the steps needed for implementation of patient dosimetry for radioactive drugs. To support the transition from administrations of fixed activities to personalised treatments based on patient-specific dosimetry, EFOMP presents a number of recommendations including: increased networking between centres and disciplines to support data collection and development of codes-of-practice; resourcing to support an infrastructure that permits routine patient dosimetry; research funding to support investigation into individualised treatments; inter-disciplinary training and education programmes; and support for investigator led clinical trials. Close collaborations between the medical physicist and responsible practitioner are encouraged to develop a similar pathway as is routine for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. EFOMP's policy is to promote the roles and responsibilities of medical physics throughout Europe in the development of molecular radiotherapy to ensure patient benefit. As the BSS directive is adopted throughout Europe, unprecedented opportunities arise to develop informed treatments that will mitigate the risks of under- or over-treatments.\n",

      "Age-standardized net survival was estimated on 19,630 colorectal cancers diagnosed between 2009 and 2015.\n",
      "Five-year net survival was 64 % for colon and 62 % for rectal cancer. The highest absolute difference between colon and rectum was 12 % for stage II women aged 75 (91% vs. 79 %). Among patients with clinical stage III rectal cancer, 67 % no longer had pathological node involvement after neoadjuvant treatment. Survival was similar in clinical stage I, II or III and pathological stage III after neoadjuvant treatment and in pathological stage III without neoadjuvant treatment (between 67 % and 72 %). It ranged between 80 and 82 % in pathological stage II, without neoadjuvant treatment or with clinical stage I, II or III before neoadjuvant treatment. Survival ranged between 93 % and 95 % in pathological stage I, treated with surgery only or with clinical stage II or III before neoadjuvant treatment.\n",

However, <30% of eligible patients undergo DXA screening. Biomechanical computed tomography (BCT) is a radiomic technique that measures bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength from computed tomography (CT) scans.\n",
      "To evaluate the (1) correlations between BCT- and DXA-assessed BMD, and (2) associations between BCT-assessed metrics and subsequent fracture.\n",
      "A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients with mHSPC between 2013 and 2020 who received CT abdomen/pelvis or positron emission tomography/CT within 48 wk before ADT initiation and during follow-up (48-96 wk after ADT initiation).\n",

      "We assess whether biomechanical computer tomography (BCT) from routine computer tomography (CT) scans can identify fracture risk among patients recently diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. We find that BCT and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived bone mineral density are strongly correlated and that BCT accurately identifies the risk for future fracture. BCT may enable broader fracture risk assessment and facilitate timely interventions to reduce fracture risk in metastatic prostate cancer patients.\n",
      "Laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer is challenging for novice surgeons because it requires a sharp dissection in a narrow pelvis with visual limitations. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the learning curve and clinical outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer performed by a novice surgeon en route to becoming an expert.\n",
      "In total, 119 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer performed by a single surgeon between June 2010 and December 2019 were analyzed. A single hybrid model based on the operative time, open conversion, complications, and resection margin involvement was generated to assess the success of laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, the learning curve was evaluated using the risk-adjusted cumulative sum (RA-CUSUM) method.\n",
      "The learning period was categorized into three phases according to the RA-CUSUM method (phase 1, 1st-33rd cases; phase 2, 34th-84th cases; and phase 3, 85th-119th cases). Tumor size (p = 0.004), distal resection margin (p = 0.003), and the number of harvested lymph nodes (p < 0.001) significantly increased with the learning period. The time to tolerable soft diet became shorter according to the learning period (p = 0.017). Advanced T stage (p = 0.024) and adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.012) were more common in phase 3.\n",
      "This study suggested that the initial technical competence of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer was acquired in the 33rd case. Technical mastery was achieved in the 84th case. After mastering the technique, the surgeon tended to challenge more advanced cases, however, the complication rates did not increase.\n",
      "Contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasonography (CH-EUS) plays an important role in the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether CH-EUS is useful for predicting the treatment efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) determined by pathological response.\n",
      "Patients who underwent CH-EUS before chemotherapy and surgical resection were divided into two groups according to poor (group-P) or rich tumor vascularity (group-R) determined by enhancement pattern on early- and late-phase CH-EUS. The pathological response to chemotherapy was categorized according to Evans' classification. Pathological analysis showing tumor cell destruction (>50 %) defined a good response.\n",
      "Early-phase CH-EUS classified 44 patients into group-R and 50 into group-P, whereas late-phase CH-EUS classified 10 into group-R and 84 into group-P. Early-phase CH-EUS classification resulted in significantly higher numbers of patients with a good response in the rich group (n = 19) than in the poor group (n = 4; P = 0.0015). Multivariate analysis showed that assignment to the rich group was the strongest independent factor associated with chemosensitivity (P = 0.006, hazard ratio = 5.66, 95 % confidence interval: 1.17-19.27). In resectable patients, the enhancement pattern was the only independent factor associated with chemosensitivity (group-P vs. group-R, P = 0.003; HR [95 % CI], 14.59 [1.38-154.38]). Late-phase CH-EUS did not reveal a significant difference between group-P and group-R.\n",

      "While use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) downstages cancers to be eligible for resection, weight loss during the neoadjuvant period due to cancer progression, gastric outlet obstruction, or neoadjuvant therapy itself is an area of concern. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of weight loss during NAC on perioperative outcomes of pancreatectomies.\n",
      "The NSQIP database 2014-2019 was utilized to study patients who received NAC for PDAC and underwent significant weight loss, defined as at least 10 % body weight loss in the six months prior to surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using Fisher's Exact Test, Pearson's Chi-squared Test, and logistic regression.\n",
      "Of the 5590 PDAC patients who received NAC, 913 (16%) experienced significant weight loss. Patients who experienced significant weight loss were more likely to experience at least one complication compared to those who did not undergo weight loss (42.2% vs. 38.7%, p = 0.023). Those who had significant weight loss were more likely to undergo unplanned intubation postoperatively (3.8% vs 2.2 %, p = 0.004), have postoperative ventilator need >48 h (3.7% vs 1.8%, p < 0.001), have postoperative septic shock (3.9% vs 1.8 %, p < 0.001), and undergo reoperation (6.0% vs 4.3%, p = 0.027). However, there were no differences for pancreatic fistula (7.7% vs 9.3 %, p = 0.15), readmission rates (15% vs 15 %, p = 0.7), or 30-day mortality (1.5% vs 1.2%, p = 0.5). Utilizing logistic regression, BMI (OR: 1.05, p = 0.032), significant weight loss (OR = 1.18, p = 0.025), sex (OR = 1.26 with female baseline, p < 0.001), history of COPD (OR = 1.39, p = 0.012), hypertensive medication use (OR = 1.18, p = 0.004), and pancreatic radiotherapy (OR = 1.16, p = 0.010) were independent preoperative predictors of a post-operative complication.\n",

      "The multikinase-inhibitor Cabozantinib is a widely used treatment strategy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), either in combination with the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor nivolumab or as monotherapy. Cabozantinib is given continuously at a dose of 60 mg once daily when used as a single agent and at 40 mg when combined with nivolumab. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE's) were shown to occur frequently.\n",
      "We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib in patients with mRCC. Patients were treated in various lines. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of an alternative treatment schedule in patients not able to maintain continuous dosing.\n",
      "This is a single center retrospective study from the Medical University of Vienna.\n",

      "Between January 2014 until April 2021, 71 patients received cabozantinib. Sixty-seven patients were eligible for full evaluation. By IMDC criteria, 32.4%, 59.2%, and 8.5% were classified as favorable, intermediate and poor risk respectively. Cabozantinib was offered as a 2nd-line or 3rd-line treatment in 38.0% and 32.4% of patients, respectively. An alternative treatment schedule was offered in 39.1% of patients. Objective responses were found in 43.3% (CR 6%) of patients and the median PFS was 10.8 months (95% CI: 5.5-16.2). When compared to continuous dosing, an alternative treatment schedule was associated with longer PFS (12.2 months (95% CI: 0-25.5) vs. 6.1 months (95% CI: 0.37-11.8) (P = .014, HR 0.46 (95% CI: 0.24-0.86), respectively) and a lower frequency and severity of TRAE's.\n",
      "Safety and efficacy of cabozantinib in real world is comparable to what has been observed in the pivotal trials, irrespective of the treatment line. An alternative schedule may further improve efficacy and safety.\n",

Analysis of lung cancer risk factor-related death rate and DALYs was performed. Age-standardized rates (ASR) and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were calculated. The incidence trend of lung cancer from 2020 to 2034 was predicted by the Nordpred age-period-cohort (APC) model.\n",

From 1990 to 2019, men were noted for the highest incidence rate, death rate, and DALYs rate across three age groups (15-49 years, 50-69 years, and over 70). During this period, the ASIR of lung cancer in females was always lower than that in males. The predominant risk factors of lung cancer were smoking, air pollution, and diet, among which smoking was the most significant one. The analysis results showed that new cases and deaths may increase in the following 15 years since 2020 in the context of lung cancer.\n",

      "Objective Of the highly accurate tests for current Helicobacter pylori infection, the urea breath test (UBT) and stool antigen test (SAT) are noninvasive and do not require endoscopy. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the accuracy of the newly developed SAT in a medical checkup setting. Methods The accuracy of the proposed SAT was examined by determining H. pylori infection status based on a history of eradication therapy, endoscopic H. pylori infection diagnosis, and blood tests (serum H. pylori antibody, serum PG II) in individuals undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) during a health checkup. Results The new SAT showed 97.3% (108/111) sensitivity for those \"currently infected,\" as well as 99.3% (530/534), 98.0% (402/410), and 98.7% (932/944) specificity for those \"never infected,\" those \"previously infected,\" and those \"never/previously infected\", respectively. Conclusion The newly developed H. pylori SAT may be useful for diagnosing H. pylori infection. Patients should be suspected of being infected even after H. pylori eradication if they have a high cutoff index in this test.\n",

      "Residual cancer cells after radiation therapy may acquire malignant phenotypes such as enhanced motility and migration ability, and therefore it is important to identify targets for preventing radiation-induced malignancy in order to increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy. G-Protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adenosine A2B receptor and cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2 and GPR55) may be involved, as they are known to have roles in proliferation, invasion, migration and tumor growth. In this study, we investigated the involvement of A2B and cannabinoid receptors in γ-radiation-induced enhancement of cell migration and actin remodeling, as well as the involvement of cannabinoid receptors in cell migration enhancement via activation of A2B receptor in human lung cancer A549 cells. Antagonists or knockdown of A2B, CB1, CB2 or GPR55 receptor suppressed γ-radiation-induced cell migration and actin remodeling. Furthermore, BAY60-6583 (an A2B receptor-specific agonist) enhanced cell migration and actin remodeling in A549 cells, and this enhancement was suppressed by antagonists or knockdown of CB2 or GPR55, though not CB1 receptor. Our results indicate that A2B receptors and cannabinoid CB1, CB2 and GPR55 receptors all contribute to γ-radiation-induced acquisition of malignant phenotypes, and in particular that interactions of A2B receptor and cannabinoid CB2 and GPR55 receptors play a role in promoting cell migration and actin remodeling. A2B receptor-cannabinoid receptor pathways may be promising targets for blocking the appearance of malignant phenotypes during radiotherapy of lung cancer.\n",
      "Improving diets requires an awareness of the need to limit foods for which excessive consumption is a health problem. Since there are limited reports on the link between this awareness and mortality risk, we examined the association between awareness of limiting food intake (energy, fat, and sweets) and all-cause mortality in a Japanese cohort study.\n",
      "Participants comprised 58,772 residents (27,294 men; 31,478 women) aged 35-69 years who completed baseline surveys of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study from 2004 to 2014. Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by sex using a Cox proportional hazard model, with adjustment for related factors. Mediation analysis with fat intake as a mediator was also conducted.\n",
      "The mean follow-up period was 11 years and 2,516 people died. Estimated energy and fat intakes according to the Food Frequency Questionnaire were lower in those with awareness of limiting food intake than in those without this awareness. Women with awareness of limiting fat intake showed a significant decrease in mortality risk (HR=0.73; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.94). Mediation analysis revealed that this association was due to the direct effect of the awareness of limiting fat intake and that the total effect was not mediated by actual fat intake. Awareness of limiting energy or sweets intake was not related to mortality risk reduction.\n",
      "Awareness of limiting food intake had a limited effect on reducing all-cause mortality risk.\n",
      "A priori estimation of sample size and subject accrual in multi-site, time-to-event clinical trials is often challenging. Such trials are powered based on the number of events needed to detect a clinically significant difference. Sample size based on number of events relates to the expected duration of observation time for each subject. Temporal patterns in site initiation and subject enrollment ultimately affect when subjects can be accrued into the study. Lag times are common as the site start-up process optimizes, resulting in delays that may curtail observational follow-up and therefore undermine power. The proposed method introduces a Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) model into the sample size estimation which accounts for the lag in site start-up. Additionally, a PERT model is introduced into a Poisson-Gamma subject accrual model to predict the quantity of study sites needed. The introduction of the PERT model provides greater flexibility in both a priori power assessment and planning the number of sites, as it specifically allows for the inclusion of anticipated delays in site start-up time. This model results in minimal power loss even when PERT distribution inputs are misspecified compared to the traditional assumption of simultaneous start-up for all sites. Together these updated formulations for sample size and subject accrual models offer an improved method for designing a multi-site time-to-event clinical trial that accounts for a flexible site start-up process.\n",
      "NLRP12 is a member of the intracellular Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, suggesting it is an innate immune receptor for the initiation and progression of several cancers. However, its role on prognosis and immune infiltrates in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is still unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate its prognostic value and its association with immune infiltrates in EOC.\n",
      "The mRNA expression of NLRP12 of EOC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed. The association between NLRP12 and clinicopathological characters was evaluated with logistic regression. The association between NLRP12 expression and survival was analyzed by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. A nomogram was used to predict the impact of NLRP12 on prognosis. Gene Ontology term analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to identify the signaling pathways related to NLRP12 expression. Immune cells infiltration for NLRP12 was analyzed using single-sample GSEA. The relationship between NLRP12 and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) was investigated by a Wilcoxon rank sum test. The expression of NLRP12 were also further verified in EOC tissues and cell lines. Additionally, we confirmed the biological function of NLRP12 in vitro.\n",
      "NLRP12 was highly expressed in patients with EOC from TCGA. High NLRP12 expression correlated with poor disease-specific survival (p < 0.001) and overall survival (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that NLRP12 expression was an independent prognostic marker for overall survival (p = 0.042). The C-indexes and calibration plots of the nomogram based on multivariate analysis indicated an effective predictive performance for EOC patients. GSEA showed enrichment of cell adhesion, tumorigenesis and immune response in the NLRP12 high expression group. Increased NLRP12 expression correlated positively with several TICs, including macrophages, neutrophils, T effector memory cells and immature dendritic cells (p < 0.001). In addition, NLRP12 silencing inhibited cell proliferation and migration in EOC cells.\n",
      "In conclusion, increased NLRP12 expression correlated significantly with poor survival and immune infiltration in EOC.\n",

      "The current stratification of tumor nodules in colorectal cancer (CRC) staging is subjective and leads to high interobserver variability. In this study, objective assessment of the shape of lymph node metastases (LNMs), extranodal extension (ENE) and tumor deposits (TDs) was correlated with outcome. A test and validation cohort were included from two different institutions. The test cohort consisted of 190 cases of stage III CRC. Slides with LNMs and TDs were annotated and processed using a segmentation algorithm to determine their shape. The complexity ratio was calculated for every shape and correlated with outcome. A cohort of 160 stage III CRC cases was used to validate findings. TDs showed significantly more complex shapes than LNMs with extranodal extension (ENE), which were more complex than LNMs without ENE (p<0.001). In the test cohort, patients with the highest sum of complexity ratios had a significantly lower DFS (p<0.01). When only the nodule with the highest complexity was considered, this effect was even stronger (p<0.001). This maximum complexity ratio per patient was identified as an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (HR 2.47, p<0.05). The trends in the validation cohort confirmed the results. More complex nodules in stage III CRC were correlated with a significantly worse DFS, even if only based on the most complex nodule. These results suggest that more complex nodules reflect more invasive tumor biology. Since most of the more complex nodules were diagnosed as TDs, we suggest providing a more prominent role for TDs in the nodal stage and include an objective complexity measure in their definition.\n",
      "To describe immediate and long-term outcomes of pressure regulating balloon (PRB) placement, exchange, and extraction from the lateral retroperitoneum (LR) in male patients receiving an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS).\n",
      "A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients that underwent primary AUS placement between 2006 to 2021. All patients had the PRB placed in the LR during the study period. Intraoperative complications during PRB placement, exchange, or removal, and indications for PRB revision, such as infection, erosion, or mechanical failures were analyzed.\n",
      "541 patients were included in the study. All patients underwent primary implantation with no intraoperative complications including no incidents of bowel or vascular injury during PRB placement. In addition, there were no instances of intraoperative injury during PRB removal (with or without PRB replacement). After mean follow-up of 54.8 months (range: 1 - 181 months), 9 patients (1.7%) developed a reservoir-specific complication with infection (5 patients, 0.9%) being the most common issue found. The second most common type or reservoir issue was a palpable or herniated reservoir. There were 2 patients (0.4%) who herniated their reservoirs and one patient with a non-bothersome, but palpable reservoir. Lastly, there were 2 incidents (0.4%) of mechanical failure caused by a leak in the PRB.\n",
      "Due to the ease and safety of placing and removing PRBs from this location and exceedingly low rates of PRB-related complications in long term follow-up, the LR should be considered as an ideal location for PRB placement in male patients receiving an AUS.\n",
      "Current management of locally advanced rectal cancer achieves high cure rates, distant metastatic spread being the main cause of patients' death. Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) employs (chemo)radiotherapy and combined chemotherapy prior to surgery to improve the treatment outcomes. TNT has been shown to reduce significantly distant metastases, increase disease-free survival by 5 - 10% in 3 years, and finally also overall survival (≈ 5% in 7 years). It proved to double the rate of pathologic complete responses, making it an attractive strategy for non-operative management to avoid permanent colostomy in patients with distal tumors. In addition, it endorses adherence to the therapy due to better tolerance and, potentially, shortens its overall duration. A number of questions related to TNT remain currently unresolved including the indications, preferred radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens, their sequence, timing of surgery, and role of adjuvant therapy. A stratified approach may be the optimal way to go.\n",
      "We reviewed phase II and III trials beginning after 2010 studying preoperative therapy in melanoma (61 trials). Compared to standard adjuvant treatment, neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show improved outcomes with approximately 70%-80% recurrence free survival at 2 years. Several biomarkers demonstrate predictive value for pathological response (higher PD-L1 expression) and survival (IFN-γ signatures, CD8+ cell density). A number of 'non-standard' treatment mechanisms are being studied in combination with ICI therapies such as TLR-9 agonists, and anti-LAG3 checkpoint inhibitors, which show promise for alternative therapy options in the neoadjuvant setting. Finally, trials for advanced unresectable melanomas show improved survival compared to definitive systemic treatment when upfront systemic therapies lead to resectability. To conclude, in the preoperative setting for melanoma, ICIs have potential to improve outcomes for patients, and will likely change the standard treatment approach for advanced resectable disease.\n",
      "Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) undergo post-treatment surveillance with thyroglobulin (TG) and cervical ultrasound (US) for several years. We aim to better define an excellent response to therapy using TG and thyroglobulin antibody (TGab) levels at 1-year to tailor appropriate length of surveillance.\n",
      "Patients with DTC who underwent surgical treatment with or without adjuvant radioiodine therapy were followed with standard ATA surveillance. TG and TGab levels at 1-year post-treatment were used to define 3 cohorts: undetectable TG (<0.5 ng/mL), detectable TG (≥0.5 ng/mL), and positive TGab (>1 IU/mL). Rates of structural recurrence and trends of TG and TGab were compared.\n",
      "Of 268 study patients with DTC at 1-year post-treatment 210/268 (78%) had undetectable TG, 29/268 (11%) had detectable TG, and 29/268 (11%) had positive TGab. Over the mean follow-up period of 4.2 years, the overall structural recurrence rate was 18/268 (7%). Structural recurrence rates were: undetectable TG at 1 year 3/210 (1%), detectable TG at 1 year 11/29 (38%), and positive TGab at 1 year 4/29 (13%). Of those with recurrence across all three cohorts, 12/18 (67%) were ATA low risk and 6/18 (33%) were ATA intermediate risk. At last follow-up, 196/210 (93%) patients with undetectable TG at 1-year continued to have undetectable TG levels and 183/210 (87%) had an ATA Excellent Response. In patients with detectable TG at 1-year, 11/29 (38%) converted to undetectable TG at last follow-up without additional treatments and no patients had an ATA Excellent Response. Of those with positive TGab at 1 year, 6/29 (21%) had resolution of TGab and undetectable TG levels at last follow-up without additional treatments and no patients had an ATA Excellent Response.\n",
      "One year after treatment of DTC, TG levels <0.5 ng/mL, in the absence of TGab, are associated with an exceedingly low risk of recurrence suggesting further surveillance may not be warranted. Patients with detectable TG or persistent TGab at 1-year should continue surveillance past 1 year due to a higher risk of recurrence.\n",
      "Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism is involved in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigates the role of BCAA metabolism in CRC progression.\n",
      "Dietary BCAA was administered to both azoxymethane-induced and azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate-induced CRC mouse models. The expression of genes related to BCAA metabolism was determined using RNA sequencing. Adjacent tissue samples, obtained from 58 patients with CRC, were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Moreover, the suppressive role of branched-chain aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2) in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and xenograft mouse models was investigated. Alterations in BCAAs and activation of downstream pathways were also assessed using metabolic analysis and western blotting.\n",
      "High levels of dietary BCAA intake promoted CRC tumorigenesis in chemical-induced CRC and xenograft mouse models. Both the mRNA and protein levels of BCAT2 were decreased in tumor tissues of patients with CRC compared to those in normal tissues. Proliferation assays and xenograft models confirmed the suppressive role of BCAT2 in CRC progression. Furthermore, the accumulation of BCAAs caused by BCAT2 deficiency facilitated the chronic activation of mTORC1, thereby mediating the oncogenic effect of BCAAs.\n",

      "Obesity is a prominent health issue worldwide and directly impacts pancreatic health, with obese individuals exhibiting a significant risk for increasing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Several factors potentially explain the increased risk for the development of PDAC, including obesity-induced chronic inflammation within and outside of the pancreas, development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, promotion of immune suppression within the pancreas during inflammation, pre- and malignant stages, variations in hormones levels (adiponectin, ghrelin, and leptin) produced from the adipose tissue, and acquisition of somatic mutations in tumor once- and suppressor proteins critical for pancreatic tumorigenesis. In this manuscript, we will explore the broad impact of these obesity-induced risk factors on the development and progression of PDAC, focusing on changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) as they pertain to prevention, current therapeutic strategies, and future directions for targeting obesity management as they relate to the prevention of pancreatic tumorigenesis.\n",

      "Mood disorders caused by chemotherapy have become more important as the survival of cancer patients increases, and new studies in this field will contribute to the prevention of this disorder. For this purpose, we used methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic agent frequently preferred in oncological cases. Mtx was administered as a single dose of 100mg/kg intraperitoneally to male Wistar albino rats. Since oxidative stress plays an important role in chemotherapy-induced emotional impairment, n-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, was administered at 500mg/kg in two doses before Mtx administration. We evaluated anxiety and depression-like behaviors 24hours after Mtx administration, as well as some oxidative and inflammatory markers in blood serum and hippocampal tissue, acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release in hippocampal tissue. In rats, Mtx induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors as well as abnormalities in oxidative and inflammatory markers in blood serum and hippocampal tissue, increased AChE activity in hippocampal tissue, and decreased BDNF release. NAC treatment was found to ameliorate Mtx-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, increase antioxidant capacity, reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory response, and regulate AChE activity and BDNF release. In conclusion, the fact that NAC treatment of Mtx was effective is important for revising the treatment strategies for individuals suffering from this disorder, and this effect is thought to be related to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power of NAC.\n",
      "Irradiation of the salivary glands during head and neck cancer treatment induces cellular senescence in response to DNA damage and contributes to radiation-induced hyposalivation by affecting the salivary gland stem/progenitor cell (SGSC) niche. Cellular senescence, such as that induced by radiation, is a state of cell-cycle arrest, accompanied by an altered pro-inflammatory secretome known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) with potential detrimental effects on the surrounding microenvironment. We hypothesized that the pro-regenerative properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may attenuate cellular senescence post-irradiation. Therefore, here we evaluated the effects of adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs) on the radiation-induced response of salivary gland organoids (SGOs).\n",
      "Proteomic analyses to identify soluble mediators released by ADSCs co-cultured with SGOS revealed secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in ADSCs, suggesting a possible role in the stem cell crosstalk. Next, the effect of recombinant HGF in the culture media of ex vivo grown salivary gland cells was tested in 2D monolayers and 3D organoid models.\n",
      "Treatment with HGF robustly increased salivary gland cell proliferation. Importantly, HGF supplementation post-irradiation enhanced proliferation at lower doses of radiation (0, 3, 7 Gy), but not at higher doses (10, 14 Gy) where most cells stained positive for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. Furthermore, HGF had no effect on the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of irradiated SGOs, suggesting there may be compensatory proliferation by cell-division competent cells instead of a reversal of cellular senescence after irradiation.\n",
      "ADSCs may positively influence radiation recovery through HGF secretion and can promote the ex vivo expansion of salivary gland stem/progenitor cells to enhance the effects of co-transplanted SGSC.\n",

      "To report the feasibility of hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) alone for early stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients.\n",
      "The oncologic outcomes of 60 cT1-2N0 ESCC patients who received hypofractionated RT (54∼60 Gy by 3.0 Gy per fraction) from 2004 to 2018 were retrospectively evaluated.\n",
      "The 5-year rates of local control (LC), progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival were 81.1%, 44.2%, 73.7%, and 54.5%, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, tumor length <3 cm was correlated with favorable LC (HR 0.167, p = 0.090), and the 5-year LC rates were 95.7% and 72.0% in <3 cm and ≥3 cm subgroups, respectively (p = 0.053). Grade ≥2 esophagitis was observed in 44 patients (73.3%) and grade ≥2 esophageal strictures developed in five (8.3%), respectively. The patients with ≥3 cm tumor more frequently suffered from grade ≥2 esophagitis (13/24 vs. 31/36, p = 0.006) and grade ≥2 esophageal stricture (0/24 vs. 5/36, p = 0.056), respectively. The patients with cT2 tumor suffered from grade ≥2 esophagitis more frequently than those with T1 tumor (29/44 vs. 15/16, p = 0.03).\n",
      "Hypofractionated RT alone, with the merit of short treatment course, could be used as feasible option in treating the early stage ESCC patients who are unfit for surgical resection or chemoradiation. Especially, tumor length <3 cm seems a good indication of this treatment scheme based on favorable LC rate with low incidence of esophageal toxicities.\n",
      "Photo-responsive therapy is an emerging treatment modality due to its bioimaging and therapeutic properties. Phototherapy induces localized hyperthermia and selectively eradicates cancer cells. The current study showed that multifunctional biodegradable liposome nanosystem (HIL NPs) containing Hyptis suaveolens bioactive molecules and IR-775, a NIR dye showed efficient bioavailability to cancer ells and allowed tumor ablation upon NIR laser irradiation. The resulting entities present in the nanosystem, i.e., bioactive molecules of Hyptis, serve as an anticancer agent, and IR-775 helps in the photothermal ablation of highly metastatic breast cancer cells. Hyptis suaveolens is a weed that grows rampantly, impeding the growth of neighboring plants; nonetheless, the bioactive compounds have demonstrated therapeutic benefits. The obtained HIL NPs, photothermally active liposome nanosystem showed a high fluorescence absorption peak in the NIR range and delivered a photothermal conversion efficiency of 55.20 % upon NIR laser irradiation. TEM and particle size analyzer reveal that HIL NPs have a size of 141 ± 30 nm with a spherical shape. The results of in-ovo (zebrafish) experiments have shown efficient bioimaging capabilities with minimal concentrations of HIL NPs compared to respective controls. Furthermore, in-vitro studies of HIL NPs against triple-negative breast cancer (4T1) indicated effective anticancer activity by a combined cytotoxic effect and hyperthermia. Tumor ablation was facilitated by reactive oxygen species production and hyperthermia, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis due to overexpression of ɣ-H2AX, Cathepsin B, and P53, which halted cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, HIL NPs demonstrated effective anticancer effects induced by combined phyto-photothermal therapy when evaluated against an in-vitro breast cancer model.\n",
      "The quick progress of epigenetic study has kindled new hope for treating many cancers. When it comes to RNA epigenetics, the ac4C acetylation modification is showing promise, whereas N-acetyltransferase 10 plays a wide range of biological functions, has a significant impact on cellular life events, and is frequently highly expressed in many malignant tumors. N-acetyltransferase 10 is an acetyltransferase with important biological involvement in cellular processes and lifespan. Because it is highly expressed in many malignant tumors, it is considered a pro-carcinogenic gene. The review aims to introduce NAT10, summarize the effects of ac4C acetylation on tumor growth from multiple angles, and discuss the possible therapeutic targeting of NAT10 and the future directions of ac4C acetylation investigations.\n",
      "G-quadruplexes (G4s) have arrested continuous interest in cancer research, and targeting G4s with small molecules has become an ideal approach for drug development. Plant-based dietary polyphenols have attracted much attention for their remarkable anti-cancer effects. Studies have suggested that polyphenols exhibit interesting scaffolds to bind G4s, which can effectively downregulate the proto-oncogenes by stabilizing those G4 structures. Therefore, this review not only summarizes studies on natural dietary polyphenols (including analogs) as G4 stabilizers, but also reveals their anti-cancer activities. Furthermore, the structural and antioxidant insights of polyphenols with G4s are discussed, and future development is proposed. These insights may pave the way for the development of the next generation of anti-cancer drugs targeting nucleic acids.\n",
      "The Wnt pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway involved in stem cell homeostasis and tissue regeneration. Aberrant signaling in the Wnt pathway is highly associated with cancer. Developing antibodies to block overactivation of Frizzled receptors (FZDs), the main receptors in the Wnt pathway, is one of the viable options for treating cancer. However, obtaining isoform-specific antibodies is often challenging due to the high degree of homology among the ten FZDs. In this study, by using a synthetic library, we identified an antibody named pF8_AC3 that preferentially binds to FZD8. Guided by the structure of the complex of pF8_AC3 and FZD8, a second-generation targeted library was further constructed, and finally, the FZD8-specific antibody sF8_AG6 was obtained. Cell-based assays showed that these antibodies could selectively block FZD8-mediated signaling activation. Taken together, these antibodies have the potential to be developed into therapeutic drugs in the future.\n",
      "Ewing's Sarcoma is an extremely aggressive tumor in children. The disease is associated with highly metastatic rate, especially at the time of diagnosis, contributing to a lower survival rate and poor prognosis. The study aimed to identify predictive biomarkers for metastatic Ewing's sarcoma through in-depth analysis of the plasma proteome profile of pediatric Ewing's sarcoma patients.\n",
      "Plasma samples from Ewing's sarcoma patients and control individuals were profiled using both shotgun and dimethyl-labeled proteomics analysis. Subsequently, Ewing's sarcoma patients were further stratified according to their metastatic state and chemotherapy response. Western blot was used for validation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine proteome metastasis predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was done to assess the diagnostic significance of the potential plasma Ewing's sarcoma biomarkers.\n",
      "Our results revealed a set of proteins significantly associated with the metastatic Ewing's sarcoma disease profile. These proteins include ceruloplasmin and several immunoglobulins. Additionally, our study disclosed significant differentially expressed proteins in pediatric Ewing's sarcoma, including CD5 antigen-like, clusterin, and dermcidin. Stable isotope dimethyl labeling and western blot further confirmed our results, strengthening the impact of such proteins in disease development. Furthermore, an unbiased ROC curve evaluated and confirmed the predictive power of these biomarker candidates.\n",

      "The inhibition of cell death, perturbation of microtubule dynamics, and acceleration of Wnt/β-catenin/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling are fundamental processes in the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). To explore the role of 2-stearoxyphenethyl phosphocholine (stPEPC), an alkylphospholipid-based compound, in CRC, we conducted an MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence staining, Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining, small interfering RNA gene silencing, a wound-healing assay, an invasion assay, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay in the human CRC cell lines HT29 and HCT116. stPEPC showed anti-proliferative properties and mitotic cell accumulation via upregulated phosphorylation of BUBR1 and an association between mitotic arrest deficiency 2 (MAD2) and cell division cycle protein 20 homolog (CDC20). These results suggest that activation of the mitotic checkpoint complex and tubulin polymerization occurred, resulting in mitotic catastrophe in HT29 and HCT116 cells. In addition, stPEPC attenuated cell migration and invasion by regulating proteins mediated by EMT, such as E-cadherin and occludin. stPEPC altered the protein expression of Wnt3a and phosphorylation of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and β-catenin as well as their target genes, including cMyc and cyclin D1, in CRC cells. Thus, stPEPC may be useful for developing new drugs to treat human CRC.\n",
      "Studies have shown that propofol-induced neurotoxicity is mediated by disruption of mitochondrial fission and fusion, leading to an imbalance in energy supply for developing neurons. Healthy mitochondria released from astrocytes migrate to compromised neurons to mitigate propofol-induced neurotoxicity, yet the precise mechanisms involved require further clarification. In our investigation, primary neurons were incubated with propofol, which decreased ATP synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS generation and neuronal apoptosis. Notably, astrocytes did not respond to the deleterious effects of propofol. The culture medium of neurons or astrocytes incubated with propofol was collected. It was found that mitochondrial ratio was decreased and mitochondrial function was impaired. Non-contact co-culture of neuro-astrocytes facilitated transcellular mitochondrial transfer in both physiological and propofol interventions, but failed to reverse propofol-induced neurotoxicity. The more pronounced damage to neuronal mitochondria induced by propofol compared to that in astrocytes alludes to secondary injury. Damaged neurons incubated with large, functional extracellular mitochondria derived from astrocytes demonstrates transfer of mitochondria to neurons, effectively reversing propofol-induced neurotoxicity. This discovery presents a novel mitochondrial transfer of neuro-astrocytes crosstalk that contributes to neuroprotection and neurological recovery in neurotoxicity.\n",
      "Phase separation compartmentalizes many cellular pathways. Given that the same interactions that drive phase separation mediate the formation of soluble complexes below the saturation concentration, the contribution of condensates vs complexes to function is sometimes unclear. Here, we characterized several new cancer-associated mutations of the tumor suppressor Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), a substrate recognition subunit of the Cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3). These pointed to a strategy for generating separation-of-function mutations. SPOP self-associates into linear oligomers and interacts with multivalent substrates, and this mediates the formation of condensates. These condensates bear the hallmarks of enzymatic ubiquitination activity. We characterized the effect of mutations in the dimerization domains of SPOP on its linear oligomerization, binding to its substrate DAXX, and phase separation with DAXX. We showed that the mutations reduce SPOP oligomerization and shift the size distribution of SPOP oligomers to smaller sizes. The mutations therefore reduce the binding affinity to DAXX but unexpectedly enhance the poly-ubiquitination activity of SPOP towards DAXX. Enhanced activity may be explained by enhanced phase separation of DAXX with the SPOP mutants. Our results provide a comparative assessment of the functional role of complexes versus condensates and support a model in which phase separation is an important factor in SPOP function. Our findings also suggest that tuning of linear SPOP self-association could be used by the cell to modulate activity and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying hypermorphic SPOP mutations. The characteristics of cancer-associated SPOP mutations suggest a route for designing separation-of-function mutations in other phase-separating systems.\n",

      "In a community-based sample aged 25-83 years (n=620; 41% female) from Northern Germany we assessed the role of the gut microbiome, sequenced from 16S rRNA genes, on the associations between aMed scores, estimated using validated food-frequency questionnaires, magnetic resonance imaging-determined visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue and C-reactive protein (CRP).\n",
      "Higher aMed scores were associated with lower SAT (-0.86 L (95%CI:-1.56,-0.17), p=0.01), VAT (-0.65 L (95%CI:-1.03,-0.27), p=0.01) and CRP concentrations (-0.35 mg/L; β: -20.1% (95% CI: 35.5, -1.09), p=0.04) in the highest versus lowest tertile after multivariate adjustment. Of the taxa significantly associated with aMed scores, higher abundance of Porphyromonadaceae mediated 11.6%, 9.3% and 8.7% of the associations with lower SAT, VAT and CRP, respectively. Conversely, a lower abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae mediated 13.1% and 18.2% of the association with SAT and CRP levels. Of the individual components of the aMed score, moderate alcohol intake was associated with lower VAT (-0.2 (95%CI:-0.4, -0.1), p=0.01) with a higher abundance of Oxalobacteraceae and lower abundance of Burkholderiaceae explaining 8.3% and 9.6% of this association, respectively.\n",
      "These novel data suggest that abundance of specific taxa in the Porphyromonadaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae families may contribute to the association between aMed scores, lower abdominal adipose tissue, and inflammation.\n",
      "Insect symbionts can alter their host phenotype and their effects can range from beneficial to pathogenic. Moreover, many insects exhibit co-infections making their study more challenging. Less than 1% of insect species have high quality referenced genomes available and fewer still also have their symbionts sequenced. Two methods are commonly used to sequence symbionts; whole genome sequencing to concomitantly capture the host and bacterial genomes, or isolation of the symbiont's genome prior to sequencing. These methods are limited when dealing with rare or poorly characterized symbionts. Long-read technology is an important tool to generate high-quality genomes as they can overcome high levels of heterozygosity, repeat content, and transposable elements which confound short-read methods. Oxford Nanopore (ONT) adaptive sampling allows a sequencing instrument to select or reject sequences in real-time. We describe a method based on ONT adaptive sampling (subtractive) approach that readily permitted the sequencing of the complete genomes of mitochondria, Buchnera and its plasmids (pLeu, pTrp) and Wolbachia genomes in two aphid species, Aphis glycines and Pentalonia nigronervosa. Adaptive sampling is able to retrieve organelles such as mitochondria and symbionts that have high representation in their hosts such as Buchnera and Wolbachia but is less successful at retrieving symbionts in low concentrations.\n",
      "Surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is traditionally done with computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans that exposes patient to radiation, nephrotoxic contrast media, and potentially increased risk for cancer. Ultrasound (US) is less labor intensive and expensive and might thus provide a good alternative for CTA surveillance. The aim of this study was to evaluate in real-life patient cohorts whether US is able to detect post-EVAR aneurysm-related complications similarly to CTA.\n",
      "This retrospective study compared the outcome of consecutive patients who underwent EVAR for intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and were surveilled solely by CTA (CTA-only cohort, n= 168) in 2000-2010 or by combined CTA and US (CTA/US cohort, n= 300) in 2011-2016, as a standard surveillance protocol in department of vascular surgery, Helsinki University Hospital. The CTA-only patients were imaged at 1, 3, and 12 months and annually thereafter. The CTA/US patients were imaged with CTA at 3 and 12 months, US at 6 months and annually thereafter. If there were suspicion of >5 mm aneurysm growth, CTA scan was performed. The patients were reviewed for imaging data, reinterventions, aneurysm ruptures, and death until December 2018. The two groups were compared for secondary rupture, aneurysm- and cancer-related death, reintervention related to AAA, and maximum aneurysm diameter increase >5 mm. The mean follow-up in the CTA-only cohort was 67 months and in CTA/US cohort 43 months.\n",
      "The two cohorts were alike for basic characteristics and for the mean aneurysm diameter. The total number of CT scans for detecting aneurysm was 84.1/100 patient years in the CTA-only cohort compared to 74.5/100 patient years for US/CTA-cohort. 40 % of patients under combined CTA/US surveillance received one or more additional CTA scans. The two cohorts did not differ for 1-, 5- and 8-year freedom from aneurysm related death, secondary sac rupture, nor the incidence of rupture preventing interventions.\n",
      "Based on the follow up data of this real-life cohort of 468 patients, combined surveillance with US and additional CTA either per protocol or due to suspicion of aneurysm-related complications had comparable outcome with sole CTA-surveillance. Thus, US can be considered a reasonable alternative for the CTA. However, our study showed also that the need of additional CTAs due to suspicion of endoleak or aneurysm non-related reasons is substantial.\n",
      "Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with early breast cancer improves outcomes but its toxicity affects patients' quality of life (QOL). The UK TACT2 trial investigated whether accelerated epirubicin improves time to recurrence and if oral capecitabine is non-inferior to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) for efficacy with less toxicity. Results showed no benefit for accelerated epirubicin and capecitabine was non-inferior. As part of the QOL substudy, we aimed to assess the effect of chemotherapies on psychological distress, physical symptoms, and functional domains.\n",
      "TACT2 was a multicentre, phase 3, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial done in 129 UK centres. Participants were aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed node-positive or high-risk node-negative invasive primary breast cancer, who had undergone complete excision, and due to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to four cycles of 100 mg/m\n",
      "From Dec 16, 2005, to Dec 5, 2008, 4391 patients (20 [0·5%] of whom were male) were enrolled in TACT2; 1281 (85·8%) of 1493 eligible patients were included in the QOL substudy. Eight (0·6%) participants in the QOL substudy were male and 1273 (99·4%) were female. Median follow-up was 85·6 months (IQR 80·6-95·9). Analysis was performed on the complete QOL dataset (as of Sept 15, 2011) when all participants had passed the 24-month timepoint. Prerandomisation questionnaires were completed by 1172 (91·5%) patients and 1179 (92·0%) completed at least one postrandomisation questionnaire. End-of-treatment HADS depression score (p=0·0048) and HADS total change score (p=0·0093) were worse for CMF versus capecitabine. Accelerated epirubicin led to worse physical function (p=0·0065), role function (p<0·0001), fatigue (p=0·0002), and systemic side-effects (p=0·0001), but not sexual function (p=0·36), compared with standard epirubicin during treatment, but the effect did not persist. Worse physical function (p=0·0048), sexual function (p=0·0053), fatigue (p<0·0001), and systemic side-effects (p<0·0001), but not role functioning (p=0·013), were seen for CMF versus capecitabine at end of treatment; these differences persisted at 12 months and 24 months.\n",
      "Accelerated epirubicin was associated with worse QOL than was standard epirubicin but only during treatment. These findings will help patients and clinicians make an informed choice about accelerated chemotherapy. CMF had worse QOL effects than did capecitabine, which were persistent for 24 months. The favourable capecitabine QOL compared with CMF supports its use as an adjuvant option after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with triple-negative breast cancer.\n",

      "Generating high levels of immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumor microenvironment contributes to cancer immune evasion. CD39 and CD73 hydrolyze adenosine triphosphate into adenosine; thus, efforts have been made to target this pathway for cancer immunotherapy. Our objective was optimizing a multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) panel to explore the role of CD39 and CD73 within the tumor microenvironment.\n",
      "In three-time points, a small cohort (n=8 ) of colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas were automated staining using an mIF panel against CK, CD3, CD8, CD20, CD39, CD73 and CD68 to compare them with individual markers immunohistochemistry (IHC) for internal panel validation. Densities of immune cells and distances from different tumor-associated immune cells to tumor cells were exploratory assessment and compared with clinicopathologic variables and outcomes.\n",
      "Comparing the three-time points and individual IHC staining results, we demonstrated high reproducibility of the mIF panel. CD39 and CD73 expression was low in malignant cells; the exploratory analysis showed higher densities of CD39 expression by various cells, predominantly stromal cells, followed by T cells, macrophages, and B cells. No expression of CD73 by B cells or macrophages was detected. Distance analysis revealed proximity of cytotoxic T cells, macrophages, and T cells expressing CD39 to malignant cells, suggesting a close regulatory signal driven by this adenosine marker.\n",

      "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is used to treat human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a severe adverse event associated with T-DXd. Current guidelines recommend permanent discontinuation of T-DXd after Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥ 2 ILD. Here, we describe a case of successful rechallenge with T-DXd after CTCAE grade 2 treatment-induced ILD. After discontinuation of T-DXd, ILD was treated with steroids until complete resolution. Given the initial beneficial antitumor response, retreatment was discussed during disease progression. In a shared decision with the patient, T-DXd was restarted at the lowest registered dose, along with low-dose steroids. ILD did not reoccur. Importantly, both clinical and radiological responses to the treatment were observed, with an improvement in the patient's quality of life. This case demonstrates that retreatment with T-DXd after a grade 2 ILD event is feasible and yields clinical benefit.\n",

      "Breast cancer is a significant cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Early and precise diagnosis is crucial, and clinical outcomes can be markedly enhanced. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era, notably in image analysis, paving the way for major advancements in breast cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment regimens. In the diagnostic workflow for patients with breast cancer, the role of AI encompasses screening, diagnosis, staging, biomarker evaluation, prognostication, and therapeutic response prediction. Although its potential is immense, its complete integration into clinical practice is challenging. Particularly, these challenges include the imperatives for extensive clinical validation, model generalizability, navigating the \"black-box\" conundrum, and pragmatic considerations of embedding AI into everyday clinical environments. In this review, we comprehensively explored the diverse applications of AI in breast cancer care, underlining its transformative promise and existing impediments. In radiology, we specifically address AI in mammography, tomosynthesis, risk prediction models, and supplementary imaging methods, including magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound. In pathology, our focus is on AI applications for pathologic diagnosis, evaluation of biomarkers, and predictions related to genetic alterations, treatment response, and prognosis in the context of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Our discussion underscores the transformative potential of AI in breast cancer management and emphasizes the importance of focused research to realize the full spectrum of benefits of AI in patient care.\n",

      "Stem/progenitor cell therapy is a promising treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) a disease characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells. Actively injecting cells into an organ is one option for cell delivery, but in the pancreas, this contributes to acute inflammation and pancreatitis. We employed a patch grafting approach to transplant biliary tree stem cells/progenitor cells (BTSC) onto the surface of the pancreas in diabetic mice. The cells engraft and differentiate into β-like cells reversing hyperglycemia during a four-month period of observation. In addition, C-peptide and insulin gradually increase in blood circulation without detectable adverse effects during this period. Moreover, the patch graft transplant promoted the proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic β-like cells with co-expression of the β cell biomarker. CONCLUSION: BTSC transplantation can effectively attenuate T1D over a four-month period that is vital important for clinical applications.\n",
      "Dysregulation of gene expression is critical for the progression of cancer. The augmented expression of hnRNP A1 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been related to its oncogenic functions. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for upregulation of hnRNP A1 have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we identified microRNA-195-5p (miR-195-5p), a miRNA downregulated in HCC, as a novel regulator governing hnRNP A1 expression. Notably, our investigations showed an inverse correlation between hnRNP A1 level, which was increased in HCC, and miR-195-5p level, which was decreased. Our findings demonstrated that hnRNP A1 significantly enhanced the migration and invasion of PLC/PRF/5 cells through its association with mRNAs regulating metastasis. MiR-195-5p also interfered with the hnRNP A1-mediated cell migration by targeting hnRNP A1. Our results underscore the significance of the miR-195-5p/hnRNP A1 axis in regulating the migratory potential of cancer cells and its role in promoting HCC by orchestrating cell migration processes.\n",
      "Heat shock proteins (HSPs) represent cellular chaperones that are classified into several families, including HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90. The role of HSPs in the cell includes the facilitation of protein folding and maintaining protein structure. Both processes play crucial roles during stress conditions in the cell such as heat shock, degradation, and hypoxia. Moreover, HSPs are important modulators of cellular proliferation and differentiation, and are strongly associated with the molecular orchestration of carcinogenesis. The expression and/or activity of HSPs in cancer cells is generally abnormally high and is associated with increased metastatic potential and activity of cancer stem cells, more pronounced angiogenesis, downregulated apoptosis, and the resistance to anticancer therapy in many patients. Based on the mentioned reasons, HSPs have strong potential as valid diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers in clinical oncology. In addition, numerous papers describe the role of HSPs as chaperones in the regulation of immune responses inside and outside the cell. Importantly, highly expressed/activated HSPs may be inhibited via immunotherapeutic targets in various types of cancers. The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship between HSPs and the tumor cell with the intention of highlighting the potential use of HSPs in personalized cancer management.\n",

      "Lungcancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in worldwide. Earlydiagnosis oflungcancer can significantly improve survival rate. However, due to its close resemblance to the malignant nodules, the possible existence of benign nodules often leads to erroneous decisions. The aim of this study was to explore whether fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy could improve the accuracy of early diagnosis of lung cancer by distinguishing lung cancer patients' (LCP') serum from patients with benign lung nodules' (PBLN') serum. In this study, A1243+1081/A1652+1539 ratio in LCP group was increased significantly compared with that in PBLN group, indicating that the ratio could be used to distinguish the serum of LCP from that of PBLN. In addition, the ratios of A2926/A2969, A1744/A2926+2859, A2926+2859/A1652+1539 were also increased significantly in LCP group compared with that in PBLN group.

      "In cancer cells that need a lot of iron for growth and metastasis, halo-transferrin (TF-containing iron) enters the cell with the help of the transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) protein. If the anticancer drug can bind to the iron site by interacting with apo-transferrin (iron-free FT), it can enter the cancer cell by the same mechanism. Two iron-related proteins, Bovine liver catalase (BLC) and apo-Transferrin (TF), that are important in cancer patients were selected and their interaction with the anti-cancer drug Floxuridine (FUDR) was investigated. Here, the protective role of FUDR was evaluated by several variables such as drug concentration, interaction time, and temperature-induced degradation of enzyme function.

      "Tamoxifen (TAM) is an effective anticancer drug for breast and ovarian cancer. However, increased risk of cardiotoxicity is a long-term clinical problem associated with TAM, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we performed experiments in cardiomyocytes and tumor-bearing or nontumor-bearing mice, and demonstrated that TAM induced cardiac injury via the IL-6/p-STAT3/PGC-1α/IL-6 feedback loop, which is responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Compared with non-tumor bearing mice, tumor-bearing mice showed stronger cardiac toxicity after TAM injection, although there was no significant difference. In vitro experiments demonstrated STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor can increase PGC-1α expression and protect cardiomyocyte via decreasing ROS. Since tumor has higher STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-6 expression level, our research results indicated combining TAM and STAT3 inhibitor might be an effective treatment strategy which can provide both tumor killing and cardioprotective function. Further in vivo research is needed to fully elucidate the effect and mechanisms of the combination therapy of TAM and STAT3 inhibitor.\n",

Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis of biomarkers from a single sample is of utmost importance to further improve both, the accuracy of diagnosis as well as the therapeutic success. This review summarizes fundamentals like biorecognition and sensing strategies for the simultaneous detection of proteins and nucleic acids and discusses challenges related to multianalyte biosensor development. We present an overview of the current state of biosensors for the combined detection of protein and nucleic acid biomarkers associated with widespread diseases, among them cancer and infectious diseases. Furthermore, we outline the multianalyte analysis in the rapidly evolving field of single-cell multiomics, to stress its significance for the future discovery and validation of biomarkers. Finally, we provide a critical perspective on the performance and translation potential of multianalyte biosensors for medical diagnostics.\n",
      "False-positive diagnosis and overdiagnosis are ongoing issues in clinical diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Identifying new disease markers is crucial for early diagnosis and improved treatment. Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a promising biomarker for cancer diagnosis due to its critical roles in tumor invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and other processes. However, its potential as biomarker for thyroid cancer diagnosis needs further investigation. This study developed an ultra-sensitive near-infrared fluorescence probe, LAN-apn, to investigate the expression level of APN in thyroid cancer and evaluate its potential as biomarker of thyroid cancer. LAN-apn could accurately and sensitively determine APN through fluorescence method (DL = 0.069 ng/mL) and colorimetric method (DL = 4.5 ng/mL). In addition, LAN-apn allowed for successful fluorescence imaging of APN in thyroid cancer cells and thyroid cancer tumors both in vivo and in vitro, and confirmed that APN was significantly upregulated in thyroid cancer. Therefore, APN may become a new biomarker for thyroid cancer diagnosis, and LAN-apn could be used as a new imaging tool for the study of APN-thyroid cancer relationship and the early diagnosis of thyroid cancer.\n",
      "Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibiting an M2 phenotype contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of various cancer types, including lung cancer. Therapeutic approaches targeting TAMs have the potential to complement and synergize with conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Through database analysis, it has become evident that the expression of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) is predominantly localized in macrophages, and its presence is associated with unfavorable outcomes in the absence of CD8+ cells. Jin-Fu-An decoction (JFAD) has been utilized as an adjunct to augment current clinical interventions. By conducting a network pharmacological analysis, we discovered that CTNNB1 is a significant target of JFAD. Experiments were conducted to examine the impact of JFAD on macrophage polarization both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the study investigated the combined effect of JFAD and cisplatin (CDDP) on mitigating adverse reactions and prolonging survival in subcutaneously transplanted tumor models and orthotopic lung cancer models. The percentage of M1 and M2 macrophages in the tumor and spleen were measured using flow cytometry. Additionally, the levels of β-catenin, M1, and M2 macrophage markers were measured by Western blotting and qPCR, while CD8 and iNOS protein expression was analyzed via immunohistochemistry. Our research findings indicate that JFAD has the ability to modulate the transformation of M2 macrophages into M1 macrophages, augment the anticancer efficacy of CDDP, and diminish the expression of cell-related markers in M2 cells. This regulatory effect may potentially be associated with the downregulation of β-catenin expression.\n",
      "Herein, a doxorubicin-loaded carbon-based drug delivery system, denoted as PC-DOX, composed of pH-responsive imine bond was developed for the tumor-targeted treatment. PC-DOX with a uniform particle size around 180 nm was synthesized by coating of as-synthesized hollow carbon-based nanoparticles (NPs) with dialdehyde PEG, which was used as carrier to attach DOX covalently through dynamic covalent bond. The unique structure endowed the advantages of specific tumor targeting and tumor microenvironment (TME) specific drug delivery capacity with PC-DOX. For the one hand, the tumor targeting caused by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect could significantly improve the tumor cellular uptake. For the other hand, the pH-responsiveness could realize the effective DOX accumulation in tumor tissues, avoiding the unwanted side effect to the normal tissues. As a result, PC-DOX with high DOX loading capacity (70.12%) and excellent biocompatibility, concurrently, presented a significant anti-tumor effect at a low mass concentration (DOX equivalent dose: 20 μg/mL). Another attractive characteristic of PC-DOX was the remarkable protective effect towards DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, which could be clearly observed from in vitro cellular, and animal assays. Compared with free DOX, the cardiomyocyte viability increased by average 30.58%, and the heart function was also significantly improved. This novel drug delivery nanoplatform provides a new method for the future clinical application of DOX in the cancer's therapeutics.\n",
      "Venetoclax is a potent inhibitor that specifically targets B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), which has been demonstrated to be effective in preclinical studies utilizing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and xenograft models. Significant antileukemic activity was also observed in clinical trials, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other drugs. This novel therapeutic approach has revolutionized the treatment prospects for AML patients with unfavorable prognoses and those who are unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy. Nevertheless, further investigations are required to establish the optimal dosing, sequencing, and combinational strategies of venetoclax for AML treatments. Additionally, identifying biomarkers is crucial for predicting response and resistance to this targeted intervention. In this review, we provide an overview of venetoclax-based therapy for AML and explore potential avenues for future research.\n",
      "Metformin is a widespread antidiabetic agent that is commonly used as a treatment against type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Regarding its therapeutic potential, multiple studies have concluded that Metformin exhibits antineoplastic activity on several types of cancer, including endometrial carcinoma. Although Metformin's antineoplastic activity is well documented, its cellular and molecular anticancer mechanisms are still a matter of controversy because a plethora of anticancer mechanisms have been proposed for different cancer cell types. In this study, we addressed the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Metformin's antineoplastic activity by using both in vitro and in vivo studies of Pten-loss driven carcinoma mouse models. In vivo, Metformin reduced endometrial neoplasia initiated by Pten-deficiency. Our in vitro studies using Pten-deficient endometrial organoids focused on both cellular and molecular levels in Metformin's tumor suppressive action. At cellular level, we showed that Metformin is involved in not only the proliferation of endometrial epithelial cells but also their regulation via a variety of mechanisms of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as TGF-β-induced apoptosis. At the molecular level, Metformin was shown to affect the TGF-β signalling., a widely known signal that plays a pivotal role in endometrial carcinogenesis. In this respect, Metformin restored TGF-β-induced apoptosis of Pten-deficient endometrial organoids through a p38-dependent mechanism and inhibited TGF-β-induced EMT on no-polarized endometrial epithelial cells by inhibiting ERK/MAPK signalling. These results provide new insights into the link between the cellular and molecular mechanism for Metformin's antineoplastic activity in Pten-deficient endometrial cancers.\n",
      "Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential in prostate cancer treatment. For many years, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been primarily applied to manage advanced prostate cancer. However, most individuals with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) administered ADT alone are at risk of developing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in less than two years. New approaches employing novel AR inhibitors (ARi) as intensified upfront systemic treatment in mHSPC have recently demonstrated substantial benefits in delaying disease progression and prolonging overall survival. Administration of novel ARi has become the new standard of care in mHSPC. The new landscape simultaneously makes treatment choice more challenging. This review provides comprehensive data on molecular structure, pharmaceutical properties, and efficacy and safety profiles reported by pivotal clinical trials. We also discuss future directions with ongoing Phase III trials of novel ARi in mHSPC. Considering these biological and clinical insights, this review aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of differences in the development and applications of novel ARi for mHSPC, which may be helpful in designing strategies for first-line treatment choices.\n",
      "Lymph node surgery is commonly performed in the staging and treatment of metastatic skin cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and, particularly, lymph node dissection (LND) to be plagued by high rates of wound complications, including surgical site infection (SSI) and seroma formation. This study evaluated the incidence of wound complications following lymph node surgery and provided the first published cost estimate of SSI associated with lymph node surgery in the UK.\n",
      "A retrospective cohort study of 169 patients with a histological diagnosis of primary skin malignancy who underwent SLNB or LND of the axilla and/or inguinal region at a single tertiary centre over a 2 year period was conducted. Demographic, patient risk factor, and operation characteristics data were collected and effect on SSI and seroma formation was analysed. Cost-per-infection was estimated using National Health Service (NHS) reference and antibiotic costs.\n",
      "A total of 146 patients underwent SLNB with a SSI rate of 4.1% and a seroma incidence of 12.3%. Twenty-three patients underwent LND with a SSI rate of 39.1% and a seroma incidence of 39.1%. Seroma formation was strongly associated with the development of SSI in both the SLNB (odds ratio (OR) = 18.0, p < 0.001) and LND (OR = 21.0, p = 0.007) group. The median additional cost of care events and treatment of SSI in the SLNB and LND groups was £199.46 and £5187.04, respectively.\n",
      "SSI remains a troublesome and costly event following SLNB and LND. Further research into perioperative care protocols and methods of reducing lymph node surgery morbidity is required and could result in significant cost savings to the NHS.\n",
      "Chlordecone is an organochlorine insecticide that has been used intensively from 1973 to 1993 in the French West Indies banana fields to control root borers. This use has resulted in persistent pollution of soils and waters, and people have been and are still exposed mainly through food. Epidemiological studies showed that this exposure is associated with health disorders, including prostate cancer, prematurity, cognitive or motor development. The measurement of chlordecone in serum is considered as the best surrogate, though no clear and definitive cut-off value has been established. This renders necessary the development of analytical methods with the lowest limit of detection as possible. While most published methods have utilized GC-MS or GC-MS/MS, in the present study we report an LC-MS/MS method based on a simple QuEChERS salts extraction. The whole procedure was validated according to ISO 15189 requirements and reached LOD and LOQ values of 0.007 and 0.02 µg/L, respectively. It was applied to more 10 000 serum samples of French Indies inhabitants. More than a half had a concentration below 0.1 µg/L and more than one third of them exhibiting a concentration below 0.05 µg/L. The capability of this LC-MS/MS method to detect very low concentrations highlights its utility in exploring the health impact of chlordecone.\n",
      "In the phase 3 KEYNOTE-040 study, pembrolizumab prolonged OS versus chemotherapy in previously treated recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC. We present a post hoc subgroup analysis by disease recurrence pattern: recurrent-only, recurrent and metastatic (recurrent-metastatic), and metastatic-only HNSCC.\n",
      "Patients had HNSCC that progressed during or after platinum-containing treatment for R/M disease or had recurrence or progression within 3-6 months of previous platinum-containing definitive therapy for locally advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W or investigator's choice of standards of care (SOC): methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab. Outcomes included OS, PFS, ORR, and DOR.

The hazard ratio (95% CI) for death for pembrolizumab versus SOC was 0.83 (0.55-1.25) in the recurrent-only, 0.78 (0.58-1.06) in the recurrent-metastatic, and 0.74 (0.52-1.05) in the metastatic-only subgroups. PFS was similar between treatment arms in all subgroups. ORR was 22.6% for pembrolizumab versus 16.7% for SOC in the recurrent-only, 10.2% versus 6.3% in the recurrent-metastatic, and 15.1% versus 8.8% in the metastatic-only subgroups. DOR was numerically longer with pembrolizumab in all subgroups.\n",

      "Initially, we established a B16-F10 brain transplant tumour model in C57BL/6 mice using a stereotaxic apparatus. The efficacy of the drug was evaluated through in vivo imaging technology, HE staining, and immunofluorescence. Mass Cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry were employed to analyse the impact of SFI on immune cell subpopulations in the tumour microenvironment. Subsequently, transcriptome sequencing and metabolomics were utilised to examine the effects of SFI on melanoma-related genes and metabolism. Molecular docking, Western Blot, and ELISA assays were conducted to investigate the targets of SFI in intervening in melanoma fatty acid metabolism. Finally, the anti-tumour effects of SFI in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors were scrutinised in the brain transplant tumour model.\n",
      "The pharmacological findings demonstrated that SFI inhibits the growth of melanoma brain transplant tumours in a dose-dependent manner.

      "Herein, a series of isatin tethered indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline hybrids was synthesized by considering the pharmacophoric features of known DNA intercalators and topoisomerase II inhibitors. The anti-proliferative properties of the synthesized compounds were evaluated against ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV-3 and Hey A8). Four of the compounds exhibited promising anti-proliferative activities, with one of them being 10-fold more potent than cisplatin against drug-resistant Hey A8 cells. Further investigations were carried out to determine the DNA intercalating affinities of the most active compounds as potential mechanisms for their anti-proliferative activities. ADMET in silico studies were performed to assess the physicochemical, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity parameters of active compounds. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report on the potential of isatin-indoloquinoxaline hybrids as structural blueprints for the development of new DNA intercalators.

      "Precision medicine is a major achievement that has impacted on management of patients diagnosed with advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) over the last decade. Molecular profiling of CCA has identified targetable alterations, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR-2) fusions, and has thus led to the development of a wide spectrum of compounds. Despite favourable response rates, especially with the latest generation FGFRi, there are still a proportion of patients who will not achieve a radiological response to treatment, or who will have disease progression as the best response. In addition, for patients who do respond to treatment, secondary resistance frequently develops and mechanisms of such resistance are not fully understood. This review will summarise the current state of development of FGFR inhibitors in CCA, their mechanism of action, activity, and the hypothesised mechanisms of resistance.\n",

      "We retrospectively included 313 eligible female patients who underwent CEM examination and surgery in our hospital from July 2017 to July 2021. Their lesions were confirmed on histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis. BC was divided into luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and triple-negative BC (TNBC) subtypes according to immunohistochemical markers. Nine features were extracted from CEM images, including tumor shape, margins, spiculated mass, lobulated mass, malignant calcification, lesion conspicuity, internal enhancement pattern, multifocal mass, and swollen axillary lymph nodes. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0. Univariate analysis and binomial regression were used to analyze the correlation between CEM imaging features and BC molecular subtypes.\n",

Molecular subtypes were significantly related to the tumor shape, margins, spiculated mass, internal enhancement pattern, malignant calcification and swollen axillary lymph nodes. Spiculated and calcified tumors were associated with Luminal subtypes, especially Luminal B (P < 0.05). Irregular tumor shape and malignant calcification were associated with HER-2-enriched subtype (P < 0.05). Oval or round tumor shape, rim enhancement, and swollen axillary lymph nodes were associated with TNBC (P < 0.05).\n",

      "Preoperative CA199 (HR = 3.122), postoperative CEA (HR = 2.941) and histological type (HR = 2.855) were independent prognostic factors in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. The 5-year overall survival (OS) in the patients with normal preoperative CEA and CA19-9 was significantly better than the patients with elevated preoperative CEA or CA19-9 and the patients with elevated preoperative CEA and CA19-9 (92.6 % vs. 87.6 % vs. 81.0 %, P < 0.05). 469 patients with normal pre- and post-operative CEA had the highest 5-year OS (93.5 %, P < 0.05). Among the 177 patients with elevated pre- and post-operative CEA, the 5-year OS rate was only 81.8 % (P < 0.05). The cut-off values for Δ CEA and Δ CA19-9 in stage II colon cancer patients with elevated preoperative tumor markers were 2.625 ng/ml and 7.835 U/ml, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that Δ CEA≥2.625 ng/ml and Δ CA19-9≥7.835 U/mL were associated with better outcome (87.8 % vs. 79.6 %, P < 0.05; 85.8 % vs. 79.1 %, P > 0.05).

      "The study aim is to compare Video-Assisted (VATS) and Robotic-Assisted (RATS) lobectomy in the effort to identify advantages and limits of robotic procedures considering the high costs and specific surgeon training.\n",
      "This is a monocentric prospective randomized trial in which patients suitable for mini-invasive lobectomy were randomized 1:2 in two groups: Group A, RATS (25 patients), and Group B, VATS (50 patients). The two groups were compared in terms of perioperative and postoperative results with a mean follow up of 37.9 (±10.9) months.\n",
      "We observed a significant reduction of pleural effusion on day 1 (140 ml vs 214, p = 0.003) and day 2 (186 vs 321, p = 0.001) for group A. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) showed significantly lower pain in the 1st p.o. day in group A (0,92 vs 1,17, p = 0,005). Surgery time in Group B was significantly lower (160 min vs 180, p = 0.036), but had a higher onset of atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias (0/25 vs 9/50, p = 0.038). The OS and DFS were similar between the two groups (95.5 % vs 93.1 %, and 95.5 % vs 89.7 %, respectively). Furthermore, no statistical difference in the evaluation of quality of life during follow-up was found.\n",
      "The RATS approach, although burdened by higher surgical costs, constitutes a valid alternative to VATS; as it determines a lower inflammatory insult, with a consequent reduction in pleural effusion, less post-operative pain and cardiological comorbidities for the patient, it can potentially determine the shortening in hospitalization. In addition, RATS allows accurate lymph node dissection, which permit to reach results that are not inferior to VATS in terms of long-term outcomes.\n",
      "Liver cancer is among the leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. There is growing interest in using traditional Chinese medicines such as arsenic trioxide (ATO) to treat liver cancer. ATO have attracted attention due to its wide range of anti-cancer activities. However, the current ATO formulations are associated with drawbacks such as short half-life, lack of targeting ability towards solid tumors and apparent toxic side effects. Tumor microvesicles (TMVs) has shown encouraging results for the delivery of drugs to solid tumor. In this work, we designed ATO loaded TMVs further modified by SP94 peptide as liver cancer specific ligand (ATO@SP94-TMVs). This drug delivery system utilized SP94 peptide that selectively targets liver cancer cells while TMVs increase the accumulation of ATO at tumor site and activate immune response owing to the associated antigens. ATO@SP94-TMVs exhibited high encapsulation efficiency and tumor microenvironment triggered enhanced release of ATO in vitro. Cytotoxicity and uptake studies revealed remarkable inhibition and specific targeting of H22 cells. In addition, excellent immune response was detected in vitro, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy. Furthermore, a tumor inhibition rate of about 53.23 % was observed in H22 bearing tumor model.

      "Aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, is a metabolic phenomenon frequently observed in cancer cells, characterized by the preferential utilization of glucose through glycolysis, even under normal oxygen conditions. This metabolic shift provides cancer cells with a proliferative advantage and supports their survival and growth. While the Warburg effect has been extensively studied, the underlying mechanisms driving this metabolic adaptation in cancer cells remain incompletely understood. In recent years, emerging evidence has suggested a potential link between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the promotion of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. The ER is a vital organelle involved in protein folding, calcium homeostasis, and lipid synthesis. Various cellular stresses, such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and accumulation of misfolded proteins, can lead to ER stress. In response, cells activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore ER homeostasis. However, prolonged or severe ER stress can activate alternative signaling pathways that modulate cellular metabolism, including the promotion of aerobic glycolysis. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding regarding the influence of ER stress on aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells to shed light on the complex interplay between ER stress and metabolic alterations in cancer cells. Understanding the intricate relationship between ER stress and the promotion of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells may provide valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer.\n",
      "With 8.8 million deaths worldwide, cancer is the major reason for the high rate of fatalities. Malignancy's commencement, progression, development, metastasis, and therapy resistance have all been correlated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. EMT promotes the cancer cells' metastatic spread and starts the development of treatment resistance. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is a histone deacetylase that is important for signaling, cell persistence, and apoptosis. It does this by deacetylating important cell signaling molecules and proteins that are associated with apoptosis. The function of SIRT1 in EMT and cancer progression, as well as the emerging therapeutic strategy of treating cancer through the inhibition of SIRT1 and EMT will be discussed in detail.\n",

      "Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignant tumor of nasopharyngeal mucosal epithelium in clinical practice. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the main treatment methods at present, but the therapeutic effect is still unsatisfactory. Studies have shown that exosomes and microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the development of cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of NPC derived exosomes on NPC and their molecular mechanisms.\n",
      "Serum was collected from healthy subjects, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infected patients and NPC patients (n = 9 group) and exosomes were extracted separately. High-throughput sequencing of exosomes was performed to screen differentially expressed miRNAs. The function of the screened miRNA was identified by treating NPC cells with exosomes. The target gene of miRNA was identified using the dual-luciferase assay. Real-Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the levels of miR-99a-5p and Bromodomain Adjacent Tozinc finger domain protein 2A (BAZ2A). Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry, and wound healing assay were utilized to detect cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis, and migration ability. The protein levels were evaluated by Western blot.\n",
      "MiR-99a-5p was identified as the most significant differentially expressed miRNA in exosomes (p < 0.05). The proliferation and migration of NPC cells were extremely facilitated by exosomes, accompanied by the suppressed apoptosis, upregulated BAZ2A, Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP1), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA), and downregulation of Interleukin (IL)-1β and Nuclear Transcription Factor-κB (NF-κB) (p < 0.05). BAZ2A was a target gene of miR-99a-5p. Furthermore, the regulatory effect of exosomes on the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis was significantly abolished by overexpression of miR-99a-5p or downregulation of BAZ2A (p < 0.05).\n",

      "Some reports have indicated a high expression level of ASB3 in various cancers, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive.\n",
      "ASB3 levels and clinical features were obtained from the TCGA database. Meanwhile, the expression levels of ASB3 in tumor and paraneoplastic tissues were further verified by qRT-PCR and Imunohistochemistry (IHC). ASB3-related downstream molecular analysis was carried out with Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Pathways linked to ASB3 expression were identified by means of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) aided in conducting a correlation analysis of ASB3 with immune infiltration. Functional experiments were performed in HepG2 cells by using the small interfering RNA.\n",
      "ASB3 expression was remarkably higher in HCC tissues. Its remarkable precision in forecasting cancer suggests that ASB3 might serve as an unidentified diagnostic and prognostic indicator of HCC. Higher ASB3 expression led to worse overall survival (OS), particularly in various clinical subgroups of HCC. GO/KEGG analysis indicated that critical biological activities, such as the activation of complement systems and humoral immune response, could potentially underlie the progression of HCC. Furthermore, GSEA demonstrated enrichment of certain pathways, including the MAPK, IL17, and fibrinolysis pathways, in samples with elevated ASB3 levels. ASB3 exhibited a substantial association with T helper cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and central memory T (Tcm) cell infiltration level. Cell function experiments confirmed elevated ASB3 levels in HCC cell lines as opposed to hepatic epithelial cell lines. Moreover, the ability of HCC cells to proliferate and invade was remarkably reduced by ASB3 knockdown.\n",
      "Summarize briefly, we found that ASB3 can be a promising biomarker in HCC.\n",
      "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a distinct class of non-coding RNAs that play regulatory roles in the initiation and progression of tumors. With advancements in transcriptome sequencing technology, numerous circRNAs that play significant roles in tumor-related genes have been identified. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing to analyze the expression levels of circRNAs in normal adjacent tissues, primary colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, and CRC tissues with liver metastasis. We successfully identified the circRNA hsa_circ_0020134 (circ0020134), which exhibited significantly elevated expression specifically in CRC with liver metastasis. Importantly, high levels of circ0020134 were associated with a poor prognosis among patients. Functional experiments demonstrated that circ0020134 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, upregulation of circ0020134 was induced by the transcription factor, PAX5, while miR-183-5p acted as a sponge for circ0020134, leading to partial upregulation of PFN2 mRNA and protein levels, thereby further activating the downstream TGF-β/Smad pathway. Additionally, downregulation of circ0020134 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC cells, which could be reversed by miR-183-5p inhibitor treatment. Collectively, our findings confirm that the circ0020134-miR-183-5p-PFN2-TGF-β/Smad axis induces EMT transformation within tumor cells, promoting CRC proliferation and metastasis, thus highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for patients with CRC liver metastasis.\n",
      "In the design of delivery strategies for anticancer therapeutics, the controlled release of intact cargo at the destined tumor and metastasis locations is of particular importance. To this end, stimuli-responsive chemical linkers have been extensively investigated owing to their ability to respond to tumor-specific physiological stimuli, such as lowered pH, altered redox conditions, increased radical oxygen species and pathological enzymatic activities. To prevent premature action and off-target effects, anticancer therapeutics are chemically modified to be transiently inactivated, a strategy known as prodrug development. Prodrugs are reactivated upon stimuli-dependent release at the sites of interest. As most drugs and therapeutic proteins have the optimal activity when released from carriers in their native and original forms, traceless release mechanisms are increasingly investigated. In this review, we summarize the chemical toolkit for developing innovative traceless prodrug strategies for stimuli-responsive drug delivery and discuss the applications of these chemical modifications in anticancer treatment including cancer immunotherapy.\n",
      "Malnutrition is common in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients. However, there are few studies on the association between malnutrition and post-transplant outcomes, with inconsistent results. No standard screening tool has been established for malnutrition in these patients. Previous research suggests the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria is effective in predicting outcomes in other cancers. This study investigates the link between malnutrition based on the GLIM criteria with mortality and complications following allogeneic HSCT.\n",
      "This single-center, observational, longitudinal, and prospective study of 98 adult leukemia patients at the Hematology Center of Shariati Hospital in Tehran, Iran, monitored patients before transplantation until 100 days after the procedure, focusing on overall survival and mortality as a primary outcome, and secondary endpoints including oral mucositis, acute GVHD, infection during hospitalization, and readmission rates.\n",
      "This study involved 98 allogeneic HSCT patients with a median age of 38 years old, 64.3 % with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 35.7 % with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among them, 26.5 % were categorized as malnourished based on GLIM criteria. During 100 days of follow-up, 13 patients died, but there was no significant difference in overall survival and mortality between malnourished and well-nourished patients. Malnourished patients demonstrated a noticeable upward trend in the incidence of oral mucositis, hospital readmission, and infection during their hospitalization. It is important to highlight that although this observed trend is discernible, it did not attain statistical significance in statistical analyses (P > 0.05).\n",
      "The current study determined that, when assessed using the GLIM criteria, malnutrition did not exert a statistically significant influence on survival, mortality, or complications within the specified age range of 18-55 years, underscoring its limited impact on this cohort of younger patients.\n",
      "Since the overexpression of folate receptors (FRs) in certain types of cancers, a variety of FR-targeted fluorescent probes for tumor detection have been developed. However, the reported probes almost all have the same targeting ligand of folic acid with various fluorophores and/or linkers. In the present study, a series of novel tumor-targeted near-infrared (NIR) molecular fluorescent probes were designed and synthesized based on previously reported 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates. All newly synthesized probes showed specific FR binding in vitro, whereas GT-NIR-4 and GT-NIR-5 with a benzene and a thiophene ring, respectively, on the side chain of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine exhibited better FR binding affinity than that of GT-NIR-6 with folic acid as targeting ligand. GT-NIR-4 also showed high tumor uptake in KB tumor-bearing mice with good pharmacokinetic properties and biological safety. This work demonstrates the first attempt to replace folic acid with antifolates as targeting ligands for tumor-targeted NIR probes.\n",
      "Combining venetoclax with the hypomethylating agents azacitidine or decitabine has shown high complete response rates (60-70 %) in newly diagnosed (ND) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, studies addressing the efficacy of this approach in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML remain limited. We conducted a retrospective analysis on patients treated with venetoclax-based therapy at a single institution. Objective response rates (ORR) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using logistic regression and Cox regression models, respectively. The total study population exhibited an ORR of 64 % with a complete remission at 34 %, complete remission with incomplete count recovery at 19%, and morphologic leukemia free state at 11 %. Patients with ND AML had a better ORR (71 %) compared to R/R AML (55 %), but the difference was not statistically significant. Median OS for the overall population was 14.4 months (range: 2-26 months). In the ND group, patients had a longer 6-month OS (82 % vs. 55 % in R/R AML), while both cohorts showed similar 12- and 24-month OS. Factors such as the hypomethylating agent chosen, adverse cytogenetics, TP53 mutations, prior hypomethylating agent use, and stem cell transplant status did not significantly affect ORR or OS. These findings support the effectiveness of venetoclax-based treatments in ND and R/R AML.\n",
      "New treatment options for advanced ovarian cancer have the potential to significantly change the treatment pathway in the UK. Understanding the structures and responsibilities of multidisciplinary teams/tumour boards (MDT) and regional variations will enable services to adapt more effectively to these changes.\n",
      "The KNOW-OC survey was conducted in 2020 to understand the views of a selected group of 66 healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in advanced ovarian cancer care in UK hospitals.\n",
      "The results showed that MDT involvement in the management of advanced ovarian cancer varied depending on pathway stage and line of relapse, with 98.5% of HCPs responding that the MDT was involved in decisions at initial presentation, but only 40.9% for patients with multiple relapses. The MDT was mostly responsible for determining whether the patients would undergo primary or interval cytoreductive surgery according to 75.8% of respondents, and most HCPs (80.3%) stated that tumour dissemination patterns were the most important factor influencing this decision. The most commonly assessed biomarkers at the time of the survey were CA125, gBRCA and tBRCA. Homologous recombination deficiency was viewed as the second most important factor for determining prognosis, but few centres had access to testing at the time of survey completion. The use of active surveillance was expected to decrease in favour of first-line targeted therapies. Nearly all (98.5%) HCPs agreed there is a role for secondary cytoreductive surgery for the treatment of recurrence (for carefully selected patients).\n",
      "The results highlighted UK-specific geographical variation in the views of HCPs on MDT involvement and specific practices, such as molecular biomarker testing, and the overall treatment approach. Together, these findings improve the understanding of reported clinical practice across the UK for ovarian cancer and provide insight into decision-making associated with updates to recommendations for best practice (e.g. European Society for Medical Oncology/European Society of Gynaecological Oncology consensus statements) and the introduction of new treatment options.\n",
      "To evaluate the use, outcomes and toxicities of high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB) to the vulvovaginal region in previously irradiated and radiotherapy-naïve patients for primary or recurrent gynaecological malignancies.\n",
      "From January 2010 to December 2020, 94 women with a median age of 64 years (range 31-88 years) were treated with interstitial HDRB for vulvovaginal disease. Treatment details, including cumulative radiotherapy doses, were recorded together with reported toxicity, using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading. Dosimetric parameters, including D90, V100 and V150 together with treatment response at 3 months, overall survival, relapse-free survival and long-term toxicity data, were collated from referring centres.\n",
      "The median follow-up was 78 months (range 2-301). Primary sites of disease included vagina (37), endometrium (29), vulva (16), ovary (7) and cervix (5). Eighty-six (91.5%) patients were treated with curative intent, eight (8.5%) were palliative treatments. Fifty patients received HDRB for recurrent disease, 39 patients for primary disease and five as part of adjuvant treatment. The anatomical site of disease treated with HDRB ranged from vagina (76), vulva (14) and peri-urethral sites (four). The 2- and 5-year local relapse-free survival rates were 76% and 72%, respectively; 15 patients experienced local failure only, whereas six patients had local and nodal/distant failure. The median time to local recurrence was 8 months (range 2-88 months). The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates for all patients were 67% and 47%, respectively; the median overall survival was 59 months. Seventy-nine (84%) patients had a complete response measured with imaging at 3 months. Grade 3 toxicity was reported in 14 patients (14.8%).\n",

      "We obtained PDAC's proteomic and clinical data from TCGA and used various analytical tools to identify differentially expressed proteins between normal and cancer tissues. We constructed our protein-based prognostic model and confirmed its accuracy using receiver operating characteristic curve and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. We elucidated clinical factor-signature protein correlations by clinical correlation assessments and protein coexpression networks. We also used immunohistochemistry (protein expression assessment), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (protein role identification) and CIBERSORT (infiltrating immune cell distribution assessment).\n",
      "CIITA, BRAF_pS445, AR, YTHDF2, IGFBP2 and CDK1_pT14 were identified as PDAC-associated prognostic proteins. All risk scores calculated using our model provided 1-, 3-, 5-year survival probability at 70 % accuracy. The reliability of our model was validated by the GEO as well. In high- and low-risk groups, age, sex, T- and N- stage disparities were significant, and prognostic and coexpressed proteins correlated. PDAC tissues demonstrated significant CDK1_pT14 overexpression but significant BRAF_pS445, YTHDF2, and IGFBP2 underexpression. Downstream proteins of BRAF were validated by IHC. Low-risk tissues demonstrated more naïve B cells, eosinophils, activated NK cells and regulatory T cells, whereas high-risk tissues demonstrated more activated memory T cells, monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells and resting NK cells.\n",

      "Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for 10% of hematologic cancers in the U.S.; however, incidence and mortality occur disproportionately between racial groups in real-world settings. Our study's objective was to systematically characterize the disparities in overall survival (OS) among Black and White patients with MM in the US using real-world evidence studies. A systematic literature review was undertaken by searching Embase and MEDLINE for observational studies conducted in the US, published between January 1, 2015 and October 25, 2021, and reporting OS for Black and White patients with MM. Records were reviewed by 2 independent researchers. OS data were extracted as hazard ratios (HR), median survival, or %, with methods of adjustment, as reported. Evidence quality was assessed by data source, population, and variables for which HRs for risk of death were adjusted. We included 33 US studies comprising 410,086 patients (21.5% Black; 78.5% White) with MM. Receipt of treatment varied; however, most studies reported that patients either underwent stem cell transplant and/or received systemic therapy. HRs from 9 studies were considered \"high quality\" by comparing nationally representative, generalizable cohorts and adjusting for key prognostic, treatment, and/or socioeconomic factors. After adjustment, these data suggested that Black patients exhibit similar or superior survival outcomes compared with their White counterparts. When data are adjusted for important confounders, Black patients exhibit better or equal survival to White patients, indicating that similarities in patient populations and equal access to treatment can bridge the disparity in patient outcomes between races.\n",

The workshop consisted of an icebreaker activity, a theory section, a second activity to reinforce learning, and a final debrief. Pre, post, and follow-up questionnaires with 5-point Likert scale items were integrated into the course to assess changes in students' understanding of psychological safety and their perspectives on the workshop.\n",
      "Ninety-one students completed the post-workshop questionnaire for a response rate of 96.8%, while 81 students (86.2%) completed the pre-workshop questionnaire, and 74 students (78.7%) completed the follow-up questionnaire. Generally, students had a much stronger understanding of psychological safety (40.2% vs. 95.6%; p<0.0001) and the value that it holds in team functioning (78.0% vs. 98.9%; p<0.0003) after they had been formally introduced to the topic, were more aware of strategies to establish inclusion and trust among members of a team (43.7% vs. 88.2%; p<0.0001), and felt more comfortable sharing or voicing their opinions in group settings thereafter (28.0% vs. 41.3%; p<0.0003).\n",

Patients with macroscopically completely resected high-grade T1 NMIBC, with or without concomitant carcinoma in situ, and with detrusor muscle (DM) present in the initial TUR specimen were considered eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included lymphovascular invasion (LVI), histological subtypes, hydronephrosis, concomitant upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), or urothelial carcinoma within the prostatic urethra. The aim was to enroll 30 patients in this feasibility study.\n",

      "Overall, 30 patients (15 per arm) were randomized over a period of 14 mo (August 2020-October 2021). Two eligible patients refused the randomization, resulting in a patient compliance rate of 93.3% for the study protocol. We excluded 49 ineligible patients before randomization because of histological subtypes (n = 16, 33%), LVI (n = 9, 18%), DM absence in the TUR specimen (n = 12, 24%), metastatic disease (n = 5, 10%), concomitant UTUC (n = 3, 6%), or hydronephrosis (n = 4, 8%). At reTUR, persistent disease was found in four patients (29%) and upstaging to muscle-invasive disease in one (7%). Over median follow-up of 17 mo, disease recurrence was detected in three patients (23%) in the reTUR arm and six patients (40%) in the upfront BCG arm. Progression to muscle-invasive disease was observed in one patient treated with upfront BCG.\n",

      "This work focused on exploring whether the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA LINC00958 is associated with the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Associations of the LINC00958 expression level with clinicopathological features of HNSCC were investigated by logistic regression and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to evaluate patient survival. Clinical data and expression profiles were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Associations of patient clinical characteristics with overall survival (OS), progression-free interval (PFI), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model. Immune cell infiltration analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were applied to determine any significant effects of LINC00958. High LINC00958 expression was related to early pT stage (P < 0.01), primary therapy outcome (P < 0.01), HPV status (P < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.001), and perineural invasion (P < 0.01). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed strong prognostic power for LINC00958 (area under curve = 0.886). High LINC00958 expression predicted poor OS (P = 0.007), DSS (P = 0.036), and PFI (P = 0.040). LINC00958 was related to signalling pathways and the infiltration of certain immune cells. miR-27b-5p was significantly associated with LINC00958, and downstream NT5E predicted poor survival in HNSCC cases. LINC00958 may affect the prognosis by regulating NT5E via miR-27b-5p, and could serve as a possible factor to predict the prognosis of HNSCC, especially oral squamous cell carcinoma.\n",

The training cohort consisted of 395 participants and included 202 cases. The validation cohort consisted of 170 participants and included 87 cases. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for feature selection. Support vector machine (SVM) was used to establish radiomics models and clinical and biomarker models for predicting the radiographic progression of OA. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC).\n",
      "The baseline, 24 M, Delta, and two combination radiomics models (Baseline and Delta, 24 M and Delta) all showed good predictive performance in the training and validation cohorts, with the combination model exhibiting the best performance. In the training cohort, the AUCs were 0.851 (95% CI: 0.812-0.890), 0.825 (95% CI: 0.784-0.865), 0.804 (95% CI: 0.761-0.847), 0.892 (95% CI: 0.860-0.924) and 0.884 (95% CI: 0.851-0.917), respectively. The AUCs in the validation cohort were 0.741 (95% CI: 0.667-0.814), 0.786 (95% CI: 0.716-0.856), 0.745 (95% CI: 0.671-0.819), 0.781 (95% CI: 0.711-0.851) and 0.802 (95% CI: 0.736-0.869), respectively. As compared, the clinical and biomarker models have AUC < 0.74. The DeLong test showed that the predictive performance of the radiomics models in the training and validation cohorts was significantly better than that of the clinical and biomarker models (P < 0.001).\n",
      "The MRI-based radiomics models of the patella all showed good predictive performance performed better than the clinical and biomarker models in predicting the radiographic progression of OA. Delta radiomics can improve the predictive performance of the single time model, the combined model of 24 M and Delta provided the best predictive performance.\n",
      "The aim of this study is to characterize the concentration-time profile, pharmacokinetics parameters, and therapeutic target attainment of meropenem in pediatric post-liver transplant patients according to the duration of infusion.\n",
      "This is a prospective cohort of pediatric transplant recipients with preserved renal function receiving meropenem 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The patients were stratified into 2 groups based on infusion duration: G1 (15 minutes of intermittent infusion) and G1 (3 hours of extended infusion). Two blood samples per child were collected during the same interval within 48 hours of starting the antimicrobial. Meropenem concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using a noncompartmental analysis. The therapeutic target was defined as 100% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration.\n",
      "Fourteen patients with 28 measured meropenem concentrations were included. Lower values of volume of distribution and meropenem clearance compared with other critically ill pediatric populations were found. All patients achieved the therapeutic target against gram-negative pathogens with a minimum inhibitory concentration of ≤8 mg/L. Patients receiving a 15-minute infusion had higher values of peak and trough concentrations, resulting in unnecessary increased total drug exposure when compared to patients receiving a 3-hour infusion (P < .05).\n",
      "Meropenem at 120 mg/kg/d attained the therapeutic target against sensitive microorganisms in pediatric liver transplant recipients. The extended infusion should be preferred for patient safety. Because of the pharmacokinetic changes resulting from liver transplantation, individualized meropenem dosing regimens may be necessary.\n",
      "Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a proteolytic enzyme, degrades the extracellular matrix and plays a key role in cell communication. However, the real-time monitoring of cell-secreted MMP-9 during cell-cell communication remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a cell-based membrane-anchored surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensor using a Au@4-mercaptobenzonitrile (4-MBN) @Ag@peptide nanoprobe for the monitoring of cell-secreted MMP-9 during cell communication. The multifunctional nanoprobe was created with Au@4-MBN@Ag acting as an interference-free SERS substrate with high enhancement in which the peptide not only serves to anchor the cell membrane but also provides MMP-9-activatable cleaved peptide chains. MMP-9-mediated cleavage resulted in the detachment of the Au@4-MBN@Ag nanoparticles from the cell membrane, thereby decreasing the SERS signals of cancer cells. The cell membrane-anchored SERS biosensor enables the real-time monitoring of cell-secreted MMP-9 during the interaction of MCF-7 and HUVEC cells. This study successfully demonstrates the dynamic change of cell-secreted MMP-9 during the communication between MCF-7 cells and HUVEC cells. The proposed nanoprobe was also utilized to precisely evaluate the breast and hepatoma cancer cell aggressiveness. This study provides a novel strategy for real-time monitoring of MMP-9 secretion during cell communication, which is promising for the investigation of the mechanisms underlying different tumor processes.\n",
      "Epigenetic modifications are significant in tumor pathogenesis, wherein the process of histone demethylation is indispensable for regulating gene transcription, apoptosis, DNA replication, and repair of damaged DNA. The lysine demethylases (KDMs) serve an essential role in the aforementioned processes, with particular emphasis on the KDM4 family, also referred to as JMJD2. Multiple studies have underscored the significance of the KDM4 family in the regulation of various biological processes including, but not limited to, the cell cycle, DNA repair mechanisms, signaling pathways, and the progression of tumor formation. Nevertheless, it is imperative to elucidate the underlying mechanism of KDM4B, which belongs to the KDM4 gene family. This review presents a comprehensive examination of the structure, mechanism, and function of KDM4B, as well as a critical analysis of the current body of research pertaining to its involvement in tumorigenesis and development. Furthermore, this review explores the potential therapeutic strategies that specifically target KDM4B.\n",
      "Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) syndrome refers to co-occurrence of two disease processes in the lung that can be difficult to diagnose but is associated with high morbidity and mortality burden. Diagnosis of CPFE is challenging because the two diseases can counterbalance respective impairments resulting in deceivingly normal-appearing chest radiography and spirometry in a dyspneic patient. Although an international committee published the terminology and definitions of CPFE in 2022, consensus on exact diagnostic criteria and optimal management strategy is yet to be determined. Herein, we provide a narrative review summarizing the literature on CPFE from 1990 to 2022, including historical background, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, imaging and pulmonary function findings, diagnosis, prognosis, complications, and treatment. Although CPFE was initially conceived as a variant presentation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, it has been recognized to occur in patients with a wide variety of interstitial lung diseases, including connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung diseases, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The affected patients have a heightened risk for pulmonary hypertension and lung cancer. Clinicians need to recognize the characteristic presenting features of CPFE along with prognostic implications of this entity.\n",
      "To determine whether patients with lymphedema of a lower extremity (LE) had a greater risk of skin cancer than those without lymphedema.\n",
      "This retrospective cohort study included patients with LE lymphedema examined at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, USA, from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2020. All patients with the phrase \"lower extremity lymphedema\" and a diagnostic code for lymphedema present in their electronic health record, as well as their age-, race-, and sex-matched controls without lymphedema, were included in the study. A Kaplan-Meier curve was constructed to examine the time to development of the first skin cancer for the lymphedema cohort and the controls. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate hazard ratios.\n",
      "In total, 4437 patients had lymphedema within the study period. Compared with the matched control group, the lymphedema group had a significantly increased risk of skin cancer. For the subset of patients with unilateral lymphedema, the lymphedematous extremity was 2.65 times as likely as the nonlymphedematous LE to have skin cancer, particularly basal cell carcinoma.\n",
      "Lower extremity lymphedema appears to be a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma, basal call carcinoma, and as expected, angiosarcoma. Clinicians caring for patients with LE lymphedema should be aware of this increased risk and monitor at-risk patients accordingly.\n",
      "Fracture non-unions have a detrimental effect on patients due to reduced mobility and severe pain. Current literature on the quality of life in non-unions is limited, hence the purpose of this study, to quantify the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with post-traumatic long bone non-unions. It was hypothesized that the HRQoL of these patients is lower than the Dutch population standard as well as for multiple chronic diseases and musculoskeletal disorders.\n",
      "From January 2020 to December 2021, this study included consecutive patients who were referred to a multidisciplinary (trauma, orthopedic and plastic surgery), non-union clinic at the Maastricht UMC+. All non-unions were evaluated using the Non-Union Scoring System (NUSS) questionnaire. Patient reported HRQoL outcomes were acquired using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS).\n",
      "50 patients were included, 18 females and 32 males, with a mean age of 55 years (± 15.5 SD). Eighteen patients presented with an open fracture, nine non-unions were infected and 39 patients had a lower extremity non-union. The mean NUSS score was 39.61 (± 14.6 SD). The mean EQ-5D-5L index score was 0.490 (± 0.261 SD), where patients experienced most problems with mobility. The mean EQ-5D-5L VAS was 61.4 (± 19.6 SD). The patients had a mean LEFS score of 28.7 (± 16.4 SD). The health-related quality of life was well below the age-corrected normative score of the Dutch population (EQ-5D-5L 0.857(p < 0.001); LEFS 77(p < 0.001)). This cohort's HRQoL was significantly lower than the HRQoL of multiple chronic and musculoskeletal disorders, including different forms of cancer and osteoarthritis.\n",
      "This study has quantified the detrimental effect of post-traumatic long bone non-unions on patient's health-related quality of life, being significantly lower than the HRQoL of the Dutch population as well as for multiple chronic and musculoskeletal medical conditions. This cohort demonstrates a patient population in need of more specialized care with a low health-related quality of life.\n",
      "The tryptophan-kynurenine pathway is increasingly recognized to play a role in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after cancer. Because tryptophan is an essential amino acid, and vitamins and minerals act as enzymatic cofactors in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, a link between diet and kynurenines is plausible.\n",
      "This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal associations of macronutrient and micronutrient intake with metabolites of the kynurenine pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors up to 12 mo posttreatment.\n",
      "In a prospective cohort of stage I-III CRC survivors (n = 247), repeated measurements were performed at 6 wk, 6 mo, and 12 mo posttreatment. Macronutrient and micronutrient intake was measured by 7-d dietary records. Plasma concentrations of tryptophan and kynurenines were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). Longitudinal associations were analyzed using linear mixed models adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors.\n",
      "After adjustment for multiple testing, higher total protein intake was positively associated with kynurenic acid (KA) (β as standard deviation [SD] change in KA concentration per 1 SD increase in total protein intake: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.20), xanthurenic acid (XA) (standardized β: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.33), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA) (standardized β: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.27) concentrations, and the kynurenic acid-to-quinolinic acid ratio (KA/QA) (standardized β: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02,0.22). In contrast, higher total carbohydrate intake was associated with lower XA concentrations (standardized β: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.30, -0.07), a lower KA/QA (standardized β: -0.23; 95% CI: -0.34, -0.13), and a higher kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio (KTR) (standardized β: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.30). Higher fiber intake was associated with a higher KA/QA (standardized β: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.21) and a lower KTR (standardized β: -0.12; 95% CI: -0.20, -0.03). Higher total fat intake was also associated with higher tryptophan (Trp) concentrations (standardized β: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.30) and a lower KTR (standardized β: -0.13; 95% CI: -0.22, -0.03). For micronutrients, positive associations were observed for zinc with XA (standardized β: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.21) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (HK) (standardized β: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.20) concentrations and for magnesium with KA/QA (standardized β: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.36).\n",
      "Our findings show that intake of several macronutrients and micronutrients is associated with some metabolites of the kynurenine pathway in CRC survivors up to 12 mo posttreatment. These results may be relevant for enhancing HRQoL after cancer through potential diet-induced changes in kynurenines. Further studies are necessary to confirm our findings.\n",
      "The purpose of this document is to develop a summary of recommendations from the \"Cardiac Computed Tomographic Imaging in Cardio-Oncology: An Expert Consensus Document of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT)\" document and provide commentary on key recommendations that are relevant to radiation oncology.\n",
      "In July 2019, the SCCT convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a consensus document based on a literature search and a formal consensus process, which was separately published in 2022. A new panel consisting of the radiation oncologist from the original guideline and additional radiation oncologists was formed to address SCCT recommendations and their implications for radiation oncology.\n",
      "The SCCT consensus document included 6 core sections. Two of these sections were identified as particularly relevant to radiation oncologists. These include evaluation of shared risk factors and role of cardiac computed tomography in risk stratification of patients with cancer (section 1) and the role of cardiac computed tomography in the evaluation of the effects of radiation therapy (section 4). These recommendations are summarized, with additional commentary on the role of radiation oncologists as individual practitioners and radiation oncology practices as a whole in evaluation of coronary artery calcifications on computed tomography images; assessment of the effects of radiation therapy on cardiovascular risk after treatment; and management of patients at elevated risk of cardiovascular sequelae of treatment. Radiation oncologists should be aware of the recommendations in the SCCT consensus document and consider those elements that relate to their practice. This summary document calls attention to the key roles and limitations of radiation oncologists and radiation oncology practices in managing cardiotoxicity risk and highlights the need for ongoing study on the effects of radiation therapy on the heart, cardiac substructures, and long-term risk of cardiotoxicity related to treatment.\n",
      "A recent observational study suggested that the risk of cardiovascular events could be higher among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals with HIV who receive integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based ART than among those who receive other ART regimens. We aimed to emulate target trials separately in ART-naive and ART-experienced individuals with HIV to examine the effect of using INSTI-based regimens versus other ART regimens on the 4-year risk of cardiovascular events.\n",
      "We used routinely recorded clinical data from 12 cohorts that collected information on cardiovascular events, BMI, and blood pressure from two international consortia of cohorts of people with HIV from Europe and North America. For the target trial in individuals who had previously never used ART (ie, ART-naive), eligibility criteria were aged 18 years or older, a detectable HIV-RNA measurement while ART-naive (>50 copies per mL), and no history of a cardiovascular event or cancer. Eligibility criteria for the target trial in those with previous use of non-INSTI-based ART (ie, ART-experienced) were the same except that individuals had to have been on at least one non-INSTI-based ART regimen and be virally suppressed (≤50 copies per mL). We assessed eligibility for both trials for each person-month between January, 2013, and January, 2023, and assigned individuals to the treatment strategy that was compatible with their data. We estimated the standardised 4-year risks of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or invasive cardiovascular procedure) via pooled logistic regression models adjusting for time and baseline covariates. In per-protocol analyses, we censored individuals if they deviated from their assigned treatment strategy for more than 2 months and weighted uncensored individuals by the inverse of their time-varying probability of remaining uncensored. The denominator of the weight was estimated via a pooled logistic model that included baseline and time-varying covariates.\n",
      "The analysis in ART-naive individuals included 10 767 INSTI initiators and 8292 non-initiators of INSTI. There were 43 cardiovascular events in INSTI initiators (median follow-up of 29 months; IQR 15-45) and 52 in non-initiators (39 months; 18-47): standardised 4-year risks were 0·76% (95% CI 0·51 to 1·04) in INSTI initiators and 0·75% (0·54 to 0·98) in non-INSTI initiators; risk ratio 1·01 (0·57 to 1·57); risk difference 0·0089% (-0·43 to 0·36). The analysis in ART-experienced individuals included 7875 INSTI initiators and 373 965 non-initiators. There were 56 events in INSTI initiators (median follow-up 18 months; IQR 9-29) and 3103 events (808 unique) in non-INSTI initiators (26 months; 15-37) in non-initiators: standardised 4-year risks 1·41% (95% CI 0·88 to 2·03) in INSTI initiators and 1·48% (1·28 to 1·71) in non-initiators; risk ratio 0·95 (0·60 to 1·36); risk difference -0·068% (-0·60 to 0·52).\n",

      "Detection of tumor biomarkers in body fluids is a significant advancement in cancer treatment because it allows diagnosis without invasive tissue biopsies. Nucleases have long been regarded as a potential class of biomarkers that can indicate the occurrence and progression of cancers. Among these, flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) plays an important role in DNA replication and repair, and also overexpressed in abnormally proliferating cells such as cancer cells. FEN1 is thus considered to be a potential biomarker as well as a target for cancer therapy.\n",
      "We developed a novel method for detecting FEN1 based on its specific endonuclease activity which incises bifurcated nucleic acids (flaps), in combination with in vitro transcription. Developed method uses a simple DNA structure (substrate DNA) carrying a short 5'-flap sequence, and a single-stranded sensor DNA encoding the Broccoli light-up aptamer. When the assay mixture was supplied with a FEN1-containing sample, the flap sequence encoding the sense sequence of T7 promoter was cleaved and released from the substrate DNA. Because the sensor DNA was designed to carry the Broccoli RNA aptamer under the antisense sequence of T7 promoter, hybridization of the excised flap onto the sensor DNA initiated the transcription of the Broccoli RNA aptamer, enabling determination of the FEN1 titer based on the fluorescence of transcribed Broccoli aptamer. By using a combination of FEN1-mediated generation of a short oligonucleotide and subsequent oligonucleotide-dependent in vitro transcription, this method could detect FEN1 in biological samples within 1 h.\n",
      "Developed method enables the detection of FEN1 by a simple one-pot reaction. It can detect sub-nanomolar concentrations of FEN1 within an hour, and has the potential to be used for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug screening. It also enables easy identification of compounds that inhibit FEN1 activity and is thus a versatile platform for screening anti-cancer drugs. We anticipate that the basic principles of this assay can be applied to detect other biomolecules, such as nucleic acids.\n",
      "Soluble programmed death-ligand 1 (sPD-L1) is critically involved in breast cancer recurrence and metastasis. However, the clinical application of highly sensitive sPD-L1 assays remains a challenge due to its low abundance in peripheral blood. To address this issue, for the first time, an enzyme-catalyzed electrochemical aptasensing platform was devised, incorporating covalent organic frameworks-gold nanoparticles-antibody-horseradish peroxidase (COFs-AuNPs-Ab-HRP) and polyethyleneimine-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-PEI-AuNPs) for the highly specific and ultrasensitive detection of sPD-L1.\n",
      "MWCNTs-PEI-AuNPs possessed an extensive specific surface area and exhibited excellent electrical conductivity, facilitating the immobilization of aptamer and amplifying the signal. COFs modified with AuNPs not only amplified the electrical signal but also proffered a loading platform for the Ab and HRP. The favorable biocompatibility of COFs contributed to the preservation of enzyme activity and stability. HRP acted in synergy with hydrogen peroxide (H\n",
      "Paving the way for clinical application, this strategy detected differences in sPD-L1 in cell supernatants and peripheral blood of breast cancer patients with higher sensitivity compared to commercial sPD-L1 ELISA kit.

      "Thyroid cancer has been increasingly prevalent in recent years. The main diagnostic methods for thyroid are B-ultrasound scan, serum detection and puncture detection. However, these methods are invasive and complex. It is a pressing need to develop non-invasive or minimally invasive methods for thyroid cancer diagnosis. Fluorescence method as a non-invasive detection method has attracted much attention. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a common enzyme in the human body, and many diseases affect its reduction. We found that BChE is also a marker for thyroid cancer. Therefore, it is of certain clinical value to explore the expression of BChE in thyroid cancer cells through a customized fluorescent probe to provide valuable experimental data and clues for studying the expression of thyroid cancer marker to reflect thyroid status.\n",
      "In this study, we customized a fluorescent probe named Kang-BChE, which is easy to synthesize with a high yield. The experimental results show that the probe Kang-BChE can detect BChE in the linear range of 0-900 U L\n",
      "Kang-BChE is expected to be an important tool for monitoring the change of BChE content in complex biological environments due to its excellent performance. Kang-BChE can also be used to explore the influence of molecules in more organisms on the change of BChE content due to its excellent anti-interference ability. We expect that Kang-BChE can play a significant role in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer.\n",

However, it is still a great challenge on the precise sensing of As(III) in complicated conditions, especially in cellular environment. In this work, a nanoporous gold microelectrode (NPG-μE) was fabricated by a simple electrochemical alloying/dealloying method and developed for the electroanalysis of As(III) in the lung cancer cellular (A549 cells) environment. The as-fabricated NPG-μE exhibited the excellent electrochemical performance towards As(III) detection at physiological pH (0.1 M PBS solution, pH 7.4) with a high sensitivity of 5.07 μA ppb\n",
      "Raman spectroscopy has been extensively utilized as a marker-free detection method in the complementary diagnosis of cancer. Multivariate statistical classification analysis is frequently employed for Raman spectral data classification.

      "Combining 2D Raman spectrograms with automatic weighted feature fusion network (AWFFN) for bladder cancer detection is presented in this paper. Initially, the s-transform (ST) is implemented for the first time to convert 1D Raman data into 2D spectrograms, achieving 99.2% detection accuracy. Second, four upscaling techniques, including short time fourier transform (STFT), recurrence map (RP), markov transform field (MTF), and grammy angle field (GAF), were used to transform the 1D Raman spectral data into a variety of 2D Raman spectrograms. In addition, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is combined with VGG19, ResNet50, and ResNet101 to construct a weighted feature fusion network, and this parallel network is employed for evaluating multiple spectrograms. Class activation mapping (CAM) is additionally employed to illustrate and evaluate the process of feature extraction via the three parallel network branches. The results demonstrate that the combination of a 2D Raman spectrogram along with a CNN for the diagnosis of bladder cancer obtains a 99.2% accuracy rate，which indicates that it is an extremely promising auxiliary technology for cancer diagnosis.\n",

      "Cervical cancer (CC) remains a significant clinical challenge, even though its fatality rate has been declining in recent years. Particularly in developing countries, the prognosis for CC patients continues to be suboptimal despite numerous therapeutic advances.\n",
      "Using The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we extracted CC-related data. From this, 52 methylation-related genes (MRGs) were identified, leading to the selection of a 10 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signature co-expressed with these MRGs. R programming was employed to filter out the methylation-associated lncRNAs. Through univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (i.e. LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression analysis, an MRG-associated lncRNA model was constructed. The established risk model was further assessed via the Kaplan-Meier method, principal component analysis, functional enrichment annotation and a nomogram. Furthermore, we explored the potential of this model with respect to guiding immune therapeutic interventions and predicting drug sensitivities.\n",
      "The derived 10-lncRNA signature, linked with MRGs, emerged as an independent prognostic factor. Segmenting patients based on their immunotherapy responses allowed for enhanced differentiation between patient subsets. Lastly, we highlighted potential compounds for distinguishing CC subtypes.\n",

      "Sinus macrophages in draining lymph nodes (DLNs) are involved in anti-tumor immune reactions. CD169 (Sialoadhesin, Siglec-1) is expressed on sinus macrophages and is considered a surrogate marker for the immunostimulatory phenotype of macrophages. In this study, the significance of sinus macrophages in immunotherapy was evaluated using mouse models. Treatment with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody suppressed the subcutaneous tumor growth of MC38 and E0771 cells but was not effective against MB49 and LLC tumors. Decreased cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration in tumor tissues and CD169 expression in sinus macrophages were observed in MB49 and LLC cells compared to corresponding parameters in MC38 and E0771 cells. The anti-tumor effects of the anti-PD-L1 antibody on MC38 and E0771 cells were abolished when sinus macrophages in DLNs were depleted, suggesting that sinus macrophages are involved in the therapeutic effect of the anti-PD-L1 antibody. Naringin activated sinus macrophages. Naringin inhibited tumor growth in MB49- and LLC-bearing mice but did not affect that in MC38- and E0771-bearing mice. The infiltration of CTLs in tumor tissues and their activation were increased by naringin, and this effect was impaired when sinus macrophages were depleted. Combination therapy with naringin and anti-PD-L1 antibody suppressed MB49 tumor growth. In conclusion, CD169-positive sinus macrophages in DLNs are critical for anti-tumor immune responses, and naringin suppresses tumor growth by activating CD169-positive sinus macrophages and anti-tumor CTL responses. The activation status of sinus macrophages has been suggested to differ among tumor models, and this should be investigated in future studies.\n",
      "Androgen-deprivation therapy is a standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer. However, most patients eventually acquire resistance and progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we established new CRPC cell lines, AILNCaP14 and AILNCaP15, from LNCaP cells under androgen-deprived conditions. Unlike most pre-existing CRPC cell lines, both cell lines expressed higher levels of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) than parental LNCaP cells. Moreover, these cells exhibited primary resistance to enzalutamide. Since AR signaling plays a significant role in the development of CRPC, PSA promoter sequences fused with GFP were introduced into AILNCaP14 cells to conduct GFP fluorescence-based chemical screening. We identified flavopiridol, a broad-spectrum CDK inhibitor, as a candidate drug that could repress AR transactivation of CRPC cells, presumably through the inhibition of phosphorylation of AR on the serine 81 residue (pAR\n",

      "Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a malignant small round cell tumor, accounting for 10-15% of all primary bone tumors and approximately 3% of all pediatric cancers. Primary ES of the cranial bone is unusual with reported incidence from 1% to 6% of all ES cases. This report shows a rare case of primary ES of the squamous temporal bone in a 12-year-old boy with a history of swelling of the right temporal region and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. We illustrate the extremely unusual radiological presentation of this primary ES of temporal bone associated with large aneurysmal bone cyst-like (ABC-like) changes. The boy was successfully treated according to Euro Ewing 2012 protocol. He is alive with no evidence of recurrence and metastasis after 16 months of completed treatment.\n",
      "Most Americans live in a state that has legalized cannabis as a medical treatment for pain, but it is unclear how chronic pain intensity relates to cannabis use. Our objective was to examine the association between patient-reported pain measures and cannabis among adults with chronic pain.\n",
      "This cross-sectional study of a representative sample of adults reporting chronic non-cancer pain in 36 states and DC with active medical cannabis programs from March to April 2022 assessed cannabis use for chronic pain, categorized as active (within 30 days), past (>31 days), or never use (referent). Measures were pain intensity (primary) and interference, Widespread Pain Index, and number of chronic pain diagnoses.\n",
      "Among 1628 participants (57% female, 69% white), 352 (22%) actively used cannabis to treat chronic pain, 137 (8%) reported past cannabis use, and 1139 (70%) never used cannabis. In adjusted models, active cannabis use was associated with higher scores for pain intensity (score difference 1.03, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.02) and pain interference (score difference 1.82, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.65) compared with never use. Persons who actively used cannabis had higher Widespread Pain Index scores (score difference 0.56, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.86) and more chronic pain diagnoses (difference 0.45, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.83).\n",
      "People with chronic non-cancer pain who used cannabis for pain reported non-clinically meaningful worse pain measures and greater burden of chronic pain conditions than their counterparts who never used cannabis. Alternatively, those with worse pain and greater burden of pain appear more likely to use cannabis.\n",
      "Intestinal-type sinonasal adenocarcinoma is a rare epithelial malignancy primarily treated with surgery and chemoradiation. The combination of low-dose immunotherapy and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in recurrent disease has not been previously studied.A man in his 20s with papillary adenocarcinoma of the sinonasal region, following surgical resection, was treated with six cycles of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, followed by four cycles of docetaxel, cisplatin and capecitabine. While on treatment, he was found to have extensive residual disease and he was started on low-dose nivolumab and cabozantinib. Repeat imaging after ten months of treatment revealed a significant reduction in lesions.Non-squamous head and neck cancers are often excluded from major trials, and the effect of immunotherapy in these histologies is poorly understood. The response seen with low-dose immunotherapy underscores the need for further research in this setting.\n",
      "Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who are not transplant candidates often have a trajectory of rapid decline and death similar to patients with stage IV cancer. Palliative care (PC) services have been shown to be underutilized for such patients. Most studies examining the role of PC in ESLD have been done at transplant centers. Thus, determining the utilization and benefit of PC at a non-transplant tertiary center may help establish a standard of care in the management of patients with ESLD not eligible for transplant.\n",
      "We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult (>18 years) patients with ESLD admitted to Rochester Regional Health (RRH) system hospitals from 2012 to 2021. Patients were divided into groups based on the presence or absence of PC involvement. Baseline characteristics were recorded. The impact of PC was assessed by comparing the number of hospitalizations before and after the involvement of PC, comparing code status changes, health care proxy (HCP) assignments, Aspira catheter placements, and frequency of repeated paracentesis.\n",
      "In our analysis of 576 patients, 41.1% (237 patients) received a PC consult (PC group), while 58.9% (339 patients) did not (no-PC group). Baseline characteristics were comparable. However, their mean number of admissions significantly decreased (15.66 vs. 3.49, p < 0.001) after PC involvement. Full code status was more prevalent in the no-PC group (67.8% vs. 18.6%, p < 0.001), while comfort care code status was more common in the PC group (59.9% vs. 20.6%, p < 0.001). Changes in code status were significantly higher in the PC group (77.6% vs. 29.2%, p < 0.001). The PC group had a significantly higher mortality rate (83.1% vs. 46.4%, p < 0.01). Patients in the PC group had a higher likelihood of having an assigned HCP (63.7% vs. 37.5%, p < 0.001). PC referral was associated with more frequent use of an Aspira catheter (5.9% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.001) and more frequent paracentesis (30.8% vs. 16.8%, p < 0.001).\n",
      "In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence of the diverse advantages of palliative care for patients with end-stage liver disease, including reduced admissions, improved goals of care, code status modifications, enhanced healthcare proxy assignments, and targeted interventions. These findings highlight the potential significance of early integration of palliative care in the disease trajectory to provide comprehensive, patient-centered care that addresses the unique needs and preferences of individuals with advanced liver disease.\n",
      "Gastric cancer (GC) is a major global health concern with poor outcomes. HNRNPU is a multifunctional protein that participates in pre-mRNA packaging, alternative splicing regulation, and chromatin remodeling. Its potential role in GC remains unclear. In this study, the expression characteristics of HNRNPU were analyzed by the TCGA data, GEO data, then further identified by real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry using tissue specimens. From superficial gastritis, atrophic gastritis, hyperplasia to GC, the in situ expression of HNRNPU protein gradually increased, and the AUCs for diagnosis of GC and its precancerous lesions, GC were 0.911, 0.847, respectively. A nomogram integrating HNRNPU expression, lymph node metastasis and other prognostic indicators exhibited an AUC of 0.785 for predicting survival risk. Knockdown of HNRNPU significantly inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promoted apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis showed that HNRNPU could affect alternative splicing events in GC cells, with functional enrichment analysis revealing that HNRNPU may exert malignant biological function in GC progression through alternative splicing regulation. In summary, the increased expression of HNRNPU was significantly associated with the development of GC, with a good performance in diagnosing and predicting the prognostic risk of GC. Functionally, HNRNPU may play an oncogenic role in GC by regulating alternative splicing.\n",
      "Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality. Despite significant breakthroughs in conventional therapies, treatment is still far from ideal due to high toxicity in normal tissues and therapeutic inefficiency caused by short drug lifetime in the body and resistance mechanisms. Current research moves towards the development of multifunctional nanosystems for delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, bioactives and/or radionuclides that can be combined with other therapeutic modalities, like gene therapy, or imaging to use in therapeutic screening and diagnosis. The preparation and characterization of Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline (LLC) mesophases self-assembled as 2D and 3D structures are addressed, with an emphasis on the unique properties of these nanoassemblies. A comprehensive review of LLC nanoassemblies is also presented, highlighting the most recent advances and their outstanding advantages as drug delivery systems, including tailoring strategies that can be used to overcome cancer challenges. Therapeutic agents loaded in LLC nanoassemblies offer qualitative and quantitative enhancements that are superior to conventional chemotherapy, particularly in terms of preferential accumulation at tumor sites and promoting enhanced cancer cell uptake, lowering tumor volume and weight, improving survival rates, and increasing the cytotoxicity of their loaded therapeutic agents. In terms of quantitative anticancer efficacy, loaded LLC nanoassemblies reduced the IC\n",
      "Spices are contaminated with aflatoxins (AFs) and Sudan dyes which are classified as class Group 1 and Group 3 human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) respectively and their prolonged exposure may raise a human health concern. A total of 474 samples of red chili and turmeric were collected from Lahore city and were subjected to quantitative and qualitative AFs and Sudan dyes analysis by thin layer chromatography (TLC) respectively. The number of red chili and turmeric samples with ≥10 μg/kg of total AFs (European Union standard limit) were 70% and 33% and considered unfit for human consumption. The presence of Sudan dyes in red chili and turmeric samples was 67% and 27% respectively. The mean estimated daily intake (EDI) among females and males was 0.0019 μg/kg bw/day, 0.0012 μg/kg bw/day for red chili, and 0.0008 μg/kg bw/day, 0.0006 μg/kg bw/day for turmeric respectively. The mean value of margin of exposure (MOE) among females and males for ingestion of AFs-contaminated red chili and turmeric was 210.25, 332.13, 501.02, and 699.31 respectively. Therefore, the current study demands a continuous monitoring plan and the implementation of novel techniques to enhance the product's quality and protect public health.\n",
      "The cerebral cortex is a pivotal structure that is integral to advanced brain functions within the mammalian central nervous system. Patterns of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation play important roles in regulating cerebral cortex development. However, it remains unclear whether abnormal cerebral cortex development, such as microcephaly, could rescale the epigenetic landscape, potentially contributing to dysregulated gene expression during brain development. In this study, we characterize and compare the DNA methylome/hydroxymethylome and transcriptome profiles of the cerebral cortex across several developmental stages in wild-type (WT) mice and Mcph1 knockout (Mcph1-del) mice with severe microcephaly. Intriguingly, we discover a global reduction of 5'- hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) level, primarily in TET1-binding regions, in Mcph1-del mice compared to WT mice during juvenile and adult stages. Notably, genes exhibiting diminished 5hmC levels and concurrently decreased expression are essential for neurodevelopment and brain functions. Additionally, genes displaying a delayed accumulation of 5hmC in Mcph1-del mice are significantly associated with the establishment and maintenance of the nervous system during the adult stage. These findings reveal that aberrant cerebral cortex development in early stages can profoundly alter the epigenetic regulation program, which provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning diseases related to cerebral cortex development.\n",

      "Retrospective study included 57 patients with LCML, treated with 79 TARE treatments. Histology included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [n=27], small cell lung cancer (SCLC) [n=17], and lung carcinoid (LC) [n =13]. Adverse events were graded using Society of Interventional Radiology's Adverse Events Classification. Survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method; differences between groups were estimated using logrank test. Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine factors influencing survival.\n",
      "There were 11/79 severe or life-threatening adverse events within 30 days (abdominal pain, altered mental status, nausea/vomiting, acalculous/aseptic cholecystitis, hyponatremia, pancreatitis, renal failure, death from pneumonia). Median overall survival (OS) was: NSCLC 8.3 (95% CI: 6.3-16.4) months; SCLC 4.1 (95% CI: 1.9-6.6) months; and LC 43.5 (95% CI: 7.8-61.4) months. For NSCLC, presence of bilobar vs unilobar disease [HR: 5.24 (95%CI:1.64-16.79); p=0.002], more tumors [2-5 vs 1 (HR: 4.88 [95%CI: 1.17-20.37]; p=0.003); >5 vs 1 (HR: 3.75 [95%CI: 0.95-6.92]; p=0.05)], and lobar vs segmental treatment [HR: 2.56 (95%CI: 0-NA); p=0.002] were negative predictors of OS. For SCLC, receipt of >2 lines of chemotherapy vs ≤2 [HR: 3.16 (95%CI: 0.95 - 10.47); p=0.05] was a negative predictor of OS.

      "Sepsis is defined as the dysregulated immune response leading to multi-organ dysfunction and injury. Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Alamandine (ALA) is a novel endogenous peptide of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. It is known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, but its functional and vascular effects on sepsis remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the effects of ALA, as a pre- and post-treatment agent, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic and renal dysfunction and injury in the LPS-induced endotoxemia model in rats via functional, hemodynamic, vascular, molecular, biochemical, and histopathological evaluation. 10 milligrams/kilogram intraperitoneal LPS injection caused both hepatic and renal injury, decreased blood flow in several organs, and renal dysfunction at 20 hours in Sprague-Dawley rats. Our results showed that ALA treatment ameliorated systemic and renal inflammation, reduced inflammatory cytokines, prevented the enhancement of the mortality rate, reversed vascular dysfunction, corrected decreased blood flows in several organs, and reduced renal and hepatic injury via inhibiting iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and caspase expressions in the kidney. In addition, expressions of different ALA-related receptors showed alterations in this model, and ALA treatment reversed these alterations. These data suggest that ALA's systemic and renal protective effects are achieved through its anti-inflammatory, anti-pyroptotic, and anti-apoptotic effects on hemodynamic and vascular functions via reduced iNOS expression.\n",
      "The pursuit of studying this subject is driven by the urgency to address the increasing global prevalence of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and its profound health implications. NAFLD represents a significant public health concern due to its association with metabolic disorders, cardiovascular complications, and the potential progression to more severe conditions like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Liver estrogen signaling is important for maintaining liver function, and loss of estrogens increases the likelihood of NAFLD in postmenopausal women. Understanding the multifaceted mechanisms underlying NAFLD pathogenesis, its varied treatment strategies, and their effectiveness is crucial for devising comprehensive and targeted interventions. By unraveling the intricate interplay between genetics, lifestyle, hormonal regulation, and gut microbiota, we can unlock insights into risk stratification, early detection, and personalized therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, investigating the emerging pharmaceutical interventions and dietary modifications offers the potential to revolutionize disease management. This review reinforces the role of collaboration in refining NAFLD comprehension, unveiling novel therapeutic pathways, and ultimately improving patient outcomes for this intricate hepatic condition.\n",
      "Environmental factors can cause cancer in both wild animals and humans. In ecological settings, genetic variation and natural selection can sometimes produce resilience to the negative impacts of environmental change. An increase in oncogenic substances in natural habitats has therefore, unintentionally, created opportunities for using polluted habitats to study cancer defence mechanisms. The Baltic and North Sea are among the most contaminated marine areas, with a long history of pollution. Two flatfish species (flounder, Platichthys flesus and dab, Limanda limanda) are used as ecotoxicological indicator species due to pollution-induced liver cancer. Cancer is more prevalent in dab, suggesting species-specific differences in vulnerability and/or defence mechanisms. We conducted gene expression analyses for 30 flatfishes. We characterize between- and within-species patterns in potential cancer-related mechanisms. By comparing cancerous and healthy fishes, and non-cancerous fishes from clean and polluted sites, we suggest also genes and related physiological mechanisms that could contribute to a higher resistance to pollution-induced cancer in flounders. We discovered changes in transcriptome related to elevated pollutant metabolism, alongside greater tumour suppression mechanisms in the liver tissue of flounders compared to dabs. This suggests either hormetic upregulation of tumour suppression or a stronger natural selection pressure for higher cancer resistance for flounders in polluted environment. Based on gene expression patterns seen in cancerous and healthy fish, for liver cancer to develop in flounders, genetic defence mechanisms need to be suppressed, while in dabs, analogous process is weak or absent. We conclude that wild species could offer novel insights and ideas for understanding the nature and evolution of natural cancer defence mechanisms.\n",
      "Most uveal melanoma cases harbor activating mutations in either GNAQ or GNA11. Despite activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway downstream of Gαq/11, there are no effective targeted kinase therapies for metastatic uveal melanoma. The human genome encodes numerous understudied kinases, also called the \"dark kinome\". Identifying additional kinases regulated by Gαq/11 may uncover novel therapeutic targets for uveal melanoma. In this study, we treated GNAQ-mutant uveal melanoma cell lines with a Gαq/11 inhibitor, YM-254890, and conducted a kinase signaling proteomic screen using multiplexed-kinase inhibitors followed by mass spectrometry. We observed downregulated expression and/or activity of 22 kinases. A custom siRNA screen targeting these kinases demonstrated that knockdown of microtubule affinity regulating kinase 3 (MARK3) and serine/threonine kinase 10 (STK10) significantly reduced uveal melanoma cell growth and decreased expression of cell cycle proteins. Additionally, knockdown of MARK3 but not STK10 decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Analysis of RNA-sequencing and proteomic data showed that Gαq signaling regulates STK10 expression and MARK3 activity. Our findings suggest an involvement of STK10 and MARK3 in the Gαq/11 oncogenic pathway and prompt further investigation into the specific roles and targeting potential of these kinases in uveal melanoma.\n",

      "In this phase II trial patients with localized prostate cancer with clinical tumor stage T1-T3bN0 and at least one PIRADS III-V lesion were recruited to receive 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles followed by a boost of 18 Gy in 3 fractions to the prostate with a simultaneous integrated boost 21 Gy in 3 fractions to the PI-RADS lesion(s). The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of late grade ≥3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity by 18 months (NCI CTAE v4.0).\n",
      "Overall, 50 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall, 43 patients completed at least 18 months of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of grade 1, 2, and 3 late genitourinary toxicity at 18 months was 18%, 53%, and 2%. One patient was noted to have grade 3 hematuria and needed cystoscopy guided cauterization. No acute grade 3 gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicities were observed. The cumulative incidence of grade 1, 2, and 3 late gastrointestinal toxicity at 18 months was 31%, 4%, and 0%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 43.5 months, 3 patients developed biochemical recurrence, each with distant bone metastases without local or nodal recurrence. At 3-year, freedom from biochemical failure rate was 95.3% (95% confidence interval: 89.2 to 100).\n",
      "Multiparametric MRI-guided dose escalation to PI-RADS III-V lesions using a combined image guided IMRT-SBRT approach is associated with an acceptable risk of late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity. The results should be interpreted with caution considering single institutional nature, small sample size, and short follow-up and should be validated in a larger study.\n",
      "Online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) has emerged as a new treatment modality for cervical cancer. Daily online adapting improves target coverage and OAR sparing compared to traditional image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT); however, the required resources may not be feasible in a busy clinical setting. Less frequent adapting may still benefit cervical cancer patients due to large volume changes of the uterocervix of the treatment course. In this study, the dosimetry from different online adapt-on-demand schedules is compared.\n",
      "A retrospective cohort of 10 patients with cervical cancer treated with 260 fractions of definitive daily online adaptive radiotherapy was included. Plans with different adaptation schedules were simulated with adaptations weekly, every other week, once during treatment, and no adaptations (IGRT). These plans were applied to the synthetic CTs and contours generated during the patient's delivered daily adaptive workflow. The dosimetry of the weekly replan, every other week replan, once replan, and IGRT plans were compared using a paired t-test.\n",
      "When compared to traditional IGRT plans, weekly and every other week ART plans had similar CTV coverage, but statistically significant improved sparing of OARs. Weekly and every other week ART had reduced bowel bag V40 by 1.57% and 1.41%, bladder V40 by 3.82% and 1.64%, rectum V40 by 8.49% and 7.50%, and bone marrow Dmean by 0.81% and 0.61%, respectively. Plans with a single adaptation had statistically significantly worse target coverage, and moderate improvements in OAR sparing. Of the 18 dose metrics evaluated, improvements were seen in 15 for weekly ART, 14 for every other week ART, and 10 for single ART plans when compared to IGRT. When every other week ART was compared to weekly ART, both plans had similar CTV coverage and OAR sparing with only small improvements in bone marrow dosimetry with weekly ART.\n",
      "This retrospective work compares different adapt on demand treatment schedules using data collected from patients treated with daily online adaptive radiotherapy. Results suggest weekly or every other week online ART is beneficial for reduced OAR dose compared to IGRT by exploiting the gradual changes in the uterocervix target volume.\n",
      "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FPCT) parameters for detecting recurrent disease and the outcomes of salvage surgery in patients with locally advanced oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) after multimodal treatment. In total, 69 patients with locally advanced TSCC were treated with multimodal therapy. All patients underwent whole-body FPCT scans 4-10 months after the initial surgery. The analysis included FPCT parameters, such as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Histological examination was used as the reference standard. Patients with recurrent TSCC underwent salvage surgery or surgery plus systemic treatment. This study included 69 patients: 36 in the recurrent TSCC group and 33 in the non-recurrent TSCC group. The SUVmax, MTV, and TLG in the recurrent TSCC group were 11.3 ± 3.6, 28.3 ± 15.6 cm\n",

There is still much to learn about its clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis. In order to better understand the clinicopathological features and predictive survival aspects of primary SCC RMT, this study examined data from the SEER database from 2000 to 2020. Furthermore, in order to forecast the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients with primary SCC RMT, we created nomograms.\n",
      "The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to retrieve the information on individuals with primary SCC RMT who received a diagnosis between 2000 and 2020. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using the Cox proportional risk regression model. Using R software, prognostic nomograms were created to forecast the OS and CSS likelihood. The nomograms' prediction abilities were evaluated using the consistency index (C-index), calibration curve, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\n",
      "A total of 1717 patients with primary SCC RMT were included, they were randomly assigned to the primary and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio using R software. Multivariate Cox regression revealed that age, marital status, regional nodes positive, Summary stage, TNM stage, T stage, N stage, surgery were independent prognostic factors of OS, and age, marital status, regional nodes positive, tumor sizes, Summary stage, N stage, surgery were independent prognostic factors of CSS in the primary cohort. The C-index of the nomogram OS was 0.705 (95% CI: 0.685-0.725) and the C-index of CSS was 0.734 (95% CI:0.714-0.754) in the primary cohort.

      "RING finger protein 180 (RNF180), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is thought to be a tumor suppressor gene. However, the detailed mechanism of its effect on ovarian cancer (OV) has not been elucidated. Importin 4 (IPO4) which belongs to transport protein is reported to have cancer-promoting effects on OV. Here, we explored the potential signaling pathways related to RNF180 and IPO4. It was first verified that RNF180 is downregulated and IPO4 is upregulated in OV. By overexpressing or knocking down RNF180 in OV cells, we confirmed that RNF180 inhibited the malignant behaviors of OV cells both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis and proteomics experiments found that RNF180 could interact with IPO4 and promote the degradation of IPO4 through ubiquitination. In addition, overexpression of IPO4 removed the inhibitory effect of RNF180 on OV. We subsequently found that IPO4 could bind to the oncogene Sex determining Region Y-box 2 (SOX2). Knockdown of IPO4 in OV cells decreased SOX2 protein level in nucleus and promoted cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory protein-1 (p21) expression. Overexpression of RNF180 also inhibited the expression of SOX2 in nucleus. All these results indicated that RNF180 inhibited the nuclear translocation of SOX2 by promoting ubiquitination of IPO4, which ultimately promoted the expression of p21 and then suppressed the progression of OV. This study verified the tumor suppressor effect of RNF180 on OV, elucidated the mechanism of the molecule network related to RNF180 and IPO4 in OV and identified for OV.\n",
      "Chromatin architecture is essential for gene regulation, and multiple levels of the 3D chromatin organization exhibit dynamic changes during organismal development and cell differentiation. Heterochromatin, termed compartment B in Hi-C datasets, is a phase-separating gene-silencing form of chromatin, preferentially located at the two nuclear sites, nuclear (lamina-associate chromatin domains, LADs) and nucleoli (nucleoli-associated chromatin domains, NADs) peripheries. LADs and NADs contain both interchangeable and location-specific chromatin domains. Recent studies suggest striking dynamics in LADs and NADs during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neural progenitors and neurons. Here we discuss recent advances in understanding NADs changes during neuronal differentiation and future questions on how NADs integrity can contribute to healthy neurodevelopment and neurodevelopment diseases.\n",
      "lncRNA Prader Willi/Angelman Region RNA 6 (PWAR6) is considered to play a protective lncRNA in glioma, but, the role of PWAR6 in the occurrence and cisplatin resistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is elusive. In the study, we aimed to assess the role of PWAR6 in the cisplatin resistance of NSCLC. Based on the oebiotech and TargetScanHuman database, we predicted the interaction between PWAR6, miR-577 and PHACTR1. We then used small interfering RNA (siRNA), miRNA mimics and dual-luciferase reporter assay to explore the regulatory role of PWAR6/miR-577PHACTR1. Based on the online database, miR-577 can interact with PWAR6 and PHACTR1. Soon afterwards, we observed that the expression of PWAR6 and PHACTR1 was increased, while miR-577 expression was decreased in A549/DDP cells. And the cell viability was decreased, while cell apoptosis was increased in A549/DDP cells. What's more, PWAR6 knockdown can promote the expression of miR-577 and inhibit the expression of PHACTR1. PWAR6 knockdown elevated cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis of A549/DDP cells. Interestingly, we found that miR-577 can interact with PHACTR1 to regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of A549/DDP cells. To conclude, we speculated that PWAR6 knockdown elevated cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis of A549/DDP cells via miR-577/PHACTR1, providing the theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of NSCLC patients.\n",
      "Selenium (Se) may help prevent breast cancer (BC) development. Owing to limited observational evidence, we investigated whether prediagnostic Se status and/or variants in the selenoprotein genes are associated with BC risk in a large European cohort. Se status was assessed by plasma measures of Se and its major circulating proteins, selenoprotein P (SELENOP) and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), in matched BC case-control pairs (2208 for SELENOP; 1785 for GPX3 and Se) nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, n = 452) in 55 selenoprotein and Se metabolic pathway genes and an additional 18 variants previously associated with Se concentrations were extracted from existing genotyping data within EPIC for 1564 case-control pairs. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between Se status markers, SNP variants and BC risk. Overall, there was no statistically significant association of Se status with BC risk. However, higher GPX3 activity was associated with lower risk of premenopausal BC (4th versus 1st quartile, OR = 0.54, 95 % CI: 0.30-0.98, P\n",
      "Skeletal muscle is crucial for maintaining human health and overall quality of life. Acute exercise introduces a multifaceted intracellular stress, with numerous post-translational modifications believed to underpin the health benefits of sustained exercise training. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are posited to serve as second messengers, triggering cytoprotective adaptations such as the upregulation of enzymatic scavenger systems. However, a significant knowledge gap exists between the generation of oxidants in muscle and the exact mechanisms driving muscle adaptations. This review delves into the current research on subcellular redox biochemistry and its role in the physiological adaptations to exercise. We propose that the subcellular regulation of specific redox modifications is key to ensuring specificity in the intracellular response.\n",
      "Translational research and the development of targeted therapies have transformed the therapeutic landscape in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) over the last decade. However, recurrent ovarian cancer continues to pose formidable challenges to therapeutic interventions, necessitating innovative strategies to optimize treatment outcomes. Current research focuses on the development of pharmaceuticals that target potential resistance pathways to DNA repair pathways. However, the cost and toxicity of some of these therapies are prohibitive and majority of patients lack access to clinical trials. Metronomic chemotherapy, characterized by the continuous administration of low doses of chemotherapeutic agents without long treatment breaks, has emerged as a promising approach with potential implications beyond recurrent setting. It acts primarily by inhibition of angiogenesis and activation of host immune system. We here review the mechanism of action of metronomic chemotherapy, as well as its current role, limitations, and avenues for further research in the management of epithelial ovarian cancer.\n",
      "Granulosa cell apoptosis contributes to the occurrence of diminished ovarian reserve. HOXA1, belonging to the HOX gene family, is involved in regulating cancer cell apoptosis. However, whether HOXA1 participates in the granulosa cell apoptosis in DOR patients remains to be elucidated. In the current study, we demonstrated the differential transcriptomic landscape of granulosa cells in DOR patients compared to that in the controls and identified decreased expression of the HOXA1 gene. Meanwhile, we found that HOXA1 was a gonadotropin-response gene, in which FSH could promote its expression, whereas LH inhibited HOXA1 expression in human granulosa cells. CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry and TUNEL staining results showed that inhibition of endogenous HOXA1 expression promoted human granulosa cell apoptosis. Moreover, knockdown of HOXA1 increased Bax while reducing Bcl2 protein expression. Furthermore, we found a total of 947 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 426 upregulated genes and 521 downregulated genes using transcriptome sequencing technology. Enrichment analysis results showed that the DEGs were involved in apoptosis and mitochondrial function-related signaling pathways. Knockdown of HOXA1 impaired mitochondrial functions, exhibiting increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytoplasmic Ca\n",
      "Asparaginase has been traditionally applied for only treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia due to its ability to deplete asparagine. However, its ultimate anticancer potential for treating solid tumors has not yet been unleashed. In this study, we bioengineered Erwinia chrysanthemi asparaginase (ErWT), one of the US Food and Drug Administration-approved types of amino acid depleting enzymes, to achieve double amino acid depletions for treating a solid tumor. We constructed a fusion protein by joining an albumin binding domain (ABD) to ErWT via a linker (GGGGS)\n",
      "Background There is little knowledge on the dose-response association between cardiovascular health (CVH) and risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer deaths among cancer survivors. Aims We aimed to examine the dose-response association of CVH with all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. Methods A total of 1701 US adult cancer survivors were followed-up during a median of 7.3 (IQR 4.0-10.2) years from 2007 to 2018 through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used the American Heart Association´s (AHA) Life´s Essential 8 (LE8) as a proxy for CVH. Results Restricted cubic spline models indicated a close to inverse linear shape for the dose-response association between LE8 score and all-cause mortality with significant risk reductions within the range between 61.25 (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.76, 95% CI, 0.59-0.98) and 100 points (HR: 0.28, 95%CI, 0.12-0.62), and a curvilinear shape for the dose-response association between LE8 score and CVD deaths with significant risk reductions within the range between 50.25 (HR: 0.72, 95% CI, 0.52-0.99) and 90.25 points (HR: 0.15, 95%CI, 0.02-0.98). No significant dose-response association was observed between LE8 and cancer deaths. Conclusions Our study showed a close to inverse relationship between higher LE8 and risk of death from all cause, an inverse curvilinear relationship between higher LE8 and the risk for CVD death, and a non-significant association between higher LE8 and the risk of cancer death among US adult cancer survivors, which may translate to a substantial number of annual averted deaths and thus important public health implications.\n",
      "Animal venom is an important evolutionary innovation in nature. As one of the most representative animal venoms, scorpion venom contains an extremely diverse set of bioactive peptides. Scorpion venom peptides not only are 'poisons' that immobilize, paralyze, kill, or dissolve preys but also become important candidates for drug development and design. Here, the review focuses on the molecular diversity of scorpion venom peptides, their typical structural characteristics, and their multiple therapeutic or pharmaceutical applications in channelopathies, viral infections and cancers. Especially, the group of scorpion toxin TRPTx targeting transient receptor potential (TRP) channels is systematically summarized and worthy of attention because TRP channels play a crucial role in the regulation of homeostasis and the occurrence of diseases in human. We also further establish the potential relationship between the molecular characteristics and functional applications of scorpion venom peptides to provide a research basis for modern drug development and clinical utilization of scorpion venom resources.\n",
      "The worldwide and intensive use of phytosanitary compounds results in environmental and food contamination by chemical residues. Human exposure to multiple pesticide residues is a major health issue. Considering that the liver is not only the main organ for metabolizing pesticides but also a major target of toxicities induced by xenobiotics, we studied the effects of a mixture of 7 pesticides (chlorpyrifos-ethyl, dimethoate, diazinon, iprodione, imazalil, maneb, mancozeb) often detected in food samples. Effects of the mixture was investigated using metabolically competent HepaRG cells and human hepatocytes in primary culture. We report the strong cytotoxicity of the pesticide mixture towards hepatocytes-like HepaRG cells and human hepatocytes upon acute and chronic exposures at low concentrations extrapolated from the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of each compound. Unexpectedly, we demonstrated that the manganese (Mn)-containing dithiocarbamates (DTCs) maneb and mancozeb were solely responsible for the cytotoxicity induced by the mixture. The mechanism of cell death involved the induction of oxidative stress, which led to cell death by intrinsic apoptosis involving caspases 3 and 9. Importantly, this cytotoxic effect was found only in cells metabolizing these pesticides. Herein, we unveil a novel mechanism of toxicity of the Mn-containing DTCs maneb and mancozeb through their metabolization in hepatocytes generating the main metabolite ethylene thiourea (ETU) and the release of Mn leading to intracellular Mn overload and depletion in zinc (Zn). Alteration of the Mn and Zn homeostasis provokes the oxidative stress and the induction of apoptosis, which can be prevented by Zn supplementation. Our data demonstrate the hepatotoxicity of Mn-containing fungicides at very low doses and unveil their adverse effect in disrupting Mn and Zn homeostasis and triggering oxidative stress in human hepatocytes.\n",

The use of proton beam therapy (PBT) in the unilateral setting decreases the dose to the contralateral neck and organs at risk. This study aims to evaluate contralateral recurrences in patients who received ipsilateral PBT.\n",
      "We evaluated the Proton Collaborative Group database for patients treated with PBT for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma between the years 2015 - 2020 at 12 institutions. Dosimetric analysis was performed in five cases.\n",
      "Our analysis included 41 patients that received ipsilateral PBT with a mean follow-up of 14.7months. 37% patients (n=15) were treated for recurrent disease, and 63% (n=26) were treated for de novo disease. Oropharyngeal sites included tonsillar fossa (n=30) and base of tongue (n=11). The median dose and BED delivered were 69.96 CGE and 84 Gy, respectively. Eight (20%) patients experienced at least one grade 3 toxicity, dysphagia (n=4), and esophagitis (n=4). No grade ≥4 toxicities. There was one (2.4%) failure in the contralateral neck. The 1-year locoregional control was 88.9% and the freedom from distant metastasis was 95.5% (n=2).

      "Optimal consolidation for young patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) remains uncertain in the rituximab era, with an unclear benefit of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The multicenter, randomized, phase 3 FLAZ12 (NCT01827605) trial compared anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy (RIT) to ASCT as consolidation after chemoimmunotherapy, both followed by rituximab maintenance (RM).\n",
      "Patients (age 18-65 years) with R/R FL and without significant comorbidities were enrolled and treated with three courses of conventional, investigator-chosen chemoimmunotherapies. Those experiencing at least a partial response were randomized 1:1 to ASCT or RIT before CD34+ collection, and all received post-consolidation RM. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. The target sample size was 210 (105/group).\n",
      "During Aug 2012-Sept 2019, of 164 screened patients, 159 were enrolled (median age 57 [49-62] years, 55% male, 57% stage IV, 20% bulky disease). The study was closed prematurely because of low accrual. Data were analyzed on June 8, 2023, on an intention-to-treat basis, with a 77-month median follow-up from enrollment. Of 141 patients (89%), 70 were randomized to ASCT and 71 to RIT. Estimated 3-yrs PFS in both groups was 62% (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.69-1.80, P = 0.6662). Three-year overall survival also was similar between the two groups. Rates of grade ≥3 hematological toxicity were 94% with ASCT vs 46% with RIT (P < 0.001), and grade ≥3 neutropenia occurred in 94% vs 41%, respectively (P < 0.001). Second cancers occurred in nine patients after ASCT and three after radioimmunotherapy (P = 0.189).\n",
      "Even if prematurely discontinued, our study did not demonstrate superiority of ASCT vs RIT. ASCT was more toxic and demanding for patients and health service. Both strategies yielded similar, favorable long-term outcomes, suggesting that consolidation programs milder than ASCT require further investigation in R/R FL.\n",
      "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia can be persistent and refractory; however, the optimal approach for its treatment has not been determined. Although fosfomycin (FOM) has been shown to have synergistic effects with anti-MRSA agents in vitro, clinical experience with FOM combination therapy is limited. Thus, we present cases of persistent MRSA bacteremia that improved with the addition of FOM. In case 1, a 48-year-old man with prosthetic vascular graft infection developed persistent MRSA bacteremia despite vancomycin (VCM) and daptomycin (DAP) administration. On day 46, after the first positive blood culture, we added FOM to DAP. The blood culture became negative on day 53. In case 2, an 85-year-old woman presented with pacemaker-related MRSA bacteremia. She was treated with VCM, followed by DAP and DAP plus rifampicin. However, the bacteremia persisted for 32 days because of difficulties in immediate pacemaker removal. After adding FOM to DAP, the blood culture became negative on day 38. In case 3, a 57-year-old woman developed persistent MRSA bacteremia due to pulmonary valve endocarditis and pulmonary artery thrombosis after total esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. The bacteremia continued for 50 days despite treatment with DAP, followed by VCM, VCM plus minocycline, DAP plus linezolid (LZD), and VCM plus LZD. She was managed conservatively because of surgical complications. After adding FOM to VCM on day 51, the blood culture became negative on day 58. FOM combination therapy may be effective in eliminating bacteria and can serve as salvage therapy for refractory MRSA bacteremia.\n",
      "The use of monitoring registers with annexed negotiation agreements (MEAs) of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) are the pillar of Italian healthcare governance to guarantee the correct allocation of economic healthcare resources.

The purpose of this analysis was to highlight any criticalities which, if not properly addressed by doctors and pharmacists, can lead to considerable financial loss. Correct verification by the hospital pharmacy resulted in an economic recovery of approximately EUR 579,443.40 for the year 2022 and EUR 682,225.30 in the first 9 months of 2023.

      "Cancer detection rate (CDR), an important metric in the mammography screening audit, is designed to ensure adequate sensitivity. Most practices use biopsy results as the reference standard; however, commonly there is incomplete ascertainment of biopsy results. We used simulation to determine the relationship between cancer ascertainment rate of biopsy (AR-biopsy), CDR estimation, and associated error rates in classifying whether practices and radiologists meet the established ACR benchmark of 2.5/1000.\n",
      "We simulated screening mammography volume, number of cancers detected, and CDR using negative binomial and beta-binomial distributions respectively. Simulations were performed at both the practice and radiologist level. Average CDR was based on linearly re-scaling a published CDR by the AR-biopsy. CDR distributions were simulated for AR-biopsy between 5% and 100% in steps of 5 percentage points and summarized with boxplots and smoothed histograms over the range of AR-biopsy to quantify the proportion of practices and radiologists meeting the ACR benchmark at each level of AR-biopsy.\n",
      "Decreasing AR-biopsy led to an increasing probability of categorizing CDR performance below the ACR benchmark. Our simulation predicts that at the practice level, an AR-biopsy of 65% categorizes 17.6% below benchmark (compared to 1.6% at AR-biopsy of 100%) and at the radiologist level, an AR-biopsy of 65% categorizes 34.7% below benchmark (compared to 11.6% at AR-biopsy of 100%).\n",
      "Our simulation demonstrates that decreasing AR-biopsy (in currently clinically relevant ranges) has the potential to artifactually lower assessed CDR on the practice- and radiologists-level and may, in turn, increase the chance of erroneous categorization of ACR benchmark underperformance.\n",

      "Using SEER-Medicare, HCCs less than 5 cm treated with AB or SR in 2009-2016 (N=956) were identified. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression models for all-cause and cancer-specific mortality were performed including demographics, clinical factors (tumor size, medical comorbidities, and liver disease factors), social determinants of health and treatment characteristics. We also determined the most influential predictors of survival using a random forest analysis.\n",
      "Larger tumor size (3-5 cm) is predictive of all-cause (HR 1.31, p-value 0.002) and cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.59, p-value <0.001). Furthermore, chronic kidney disease is predictive of all-cause mortality (HR 1.43, p-value 0.013), though it is not predictive of cancer-specific death. Multiple liver disease factors are predictive of all-cause and cancer-specific mortality including portal hypertension and esophageal varices (HRs >1, p-values <0.05). Though Asian race is protective in univariate models, in fully adjusted, multivariable models, Asian race is not a significant protective factor. Likewise, other social determinants of health are not significantly predictive of all-cause or cancer-specific mortality. Finally, treatment with SR, in later procedure years or at high volume centers is protective for all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. In machine learning models, year procedure performed, ascites, portal hypertension and treatment choice were the most influential factors.\n",

The highest ranked EAs were significantly preferred over the lowest ranked EAs (OR: 1.916; 95% CI: 1.671-2.197, p<0.001). Participants preferred EAs that reflected active over passive engagement (OR: 1.154, 95% CI: 1.022-1.304, p=0.021), and progressive over conservative ideology (OR: 1.280, 95% CI: 1.133-1.447, p<0.001).

      "Based on findings from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer algorithm, endometrial carcinoma can now be stratified into 4 prognostically distinct subgroups based on molecular alterations and immunohistochemical (IHC) aberrations. In this study, we describe the de novo adoption and clinical reporting of prognostic subgroup classification based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) and IHC analyses of all endometrial carcinoma resections at a single institution, framed by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment model. Results from the first 13 months show 188 tumors underwent analysis by a combination of IHC and a medium-sized (56 analyzed genes) NGS-based assay. All cases were assigned as either POLE (POLE-mutated) (5.3%), mismatch repair deficient (27.7%), no specific molecular profile (45.7%), or p53 abnormal (21.3%) inclusive of multiple-classifier cases. NGS-based analysis revealed additional distinctions among the subgroups, including reduced levels of PI3K pathway activation in the p53 abnormal subgroup, an increased rate of CTNNB1 activating mutation in the no specific molecular profile subgroup, and lower TP53 mutation variant allele frequencies in POLE and mismatch repair deficient subgroups compared with the p53 abnormal subgroup.

The affected patients were 32, 34, and 42 years of age. Two patients presented with vaginal bleeding; the third presented with a cervical mass found incidentally during laparoscopy for an ectopic gestation. All 3 tumors were polypoid masses that distorted the cervix. Microscopically, they comprised cellular, fascicular, and storiform, plump spindle cells, with occasional rounded cells, and frequent mitoses (4-48/10 high power fields) in a myxoid stroma. All 3 cases showed entrapment of benign cervical glands. Inflammatory cell infiltrates, including plasma cells, were noted in all 3 tumors. One case had tumor cell necrosis, osteoid-like material, and osteoclast-like giant cells and showed lymphovascular invasion. Immunohistochemically, our cases showed patchy S100 (2/3) and CD34 (3/3) positivity. CD10 was positive in 2/3 cases. 3/3 cases showed pan-tropomyosin receptor kinase positivity (cytoplasmic). The NTRK-translocations demonstrated were: NTRK1::TMP3, NTRK1::TPR, and NTRK3::SPECC1L. Two of the patients had extensive disease and underwent chemotherapy.

      "Surgical resection represents the standard of care for people with newly diagnosed diffuse gliomas, and the neuropathological and molecular profile of the resected tissue guides clinical management and forms the basis for research. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) consortium is an international, multidisciplinary effort that aims to standardise research practice in neuro-oncology. These recommendations represent a multidisciplinary consensus from the four RANO groups: RANO resect, RANO recurrent glioblastoma, RANO radiotherapy, and RANO/PET for a standardised workflow to achieve a representative tumour evaluation in a disease characterised by intratumoural heterogeneity, including recommendations on which tumour regions should be surgically sampled, how to define those regions on the basis of preoperative imaging, and the optimal sample volume. Practical recommendations for tissue sampling are given for people with low-grade and high-grade gliomas, as well as for people with newly diagnosed and recurrent disease. Sampling of liquid biopsies is also addressed. A standardised workflow for subsequent handling of the resected tissue is proposed to avoid information loss due to decreasing tissue quality or insufficient clinical information.

The evidence that exists regarding the effect of trauma on seeking cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment and the gaps therein can define this emerging research area and guide the development of interventions intended to improve the cancer care continuum for trauma survivors. This Review summarises current literature on the effects of trauma history on screening, diagnosis, and treatment among adult patients at risk for or diagnosed with cancer. We discuss a complex relationship between trauma history and seeking cancer-related services, the nature of which is influenced by the necessity of care, perceived or measured health status, and potential triggers associated with the similarity of cancer care to the original trauma. Collaborative scientific investigations by multidisciplinary teams are needed to generate further clinical evidence and develop mitigation strategies to provide trauma-informed cancer care for this patient population.\n",

      "This national cohort study used urgent suspected cancer referral data for England from the Cancer Waiting Times dataset and linked it with cancer diagnosis data from the National Cancer Registration dataset. Data were extracted for the eight most commonly referred to urgent suspected cancer referral pathways (breast, gynaecological, head and neck, lower and upper gastrointestinal, lung, skin, and urological) for the period April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2014, with 5-year follow-up for individuals with no cancer diagnosis within 1 year of referral. The primary objective was to investigate the occurrence and type of subsequent cancer in years 1-5 following an urgent suspected cancer referral when no cancer was initially found, both overall and for each of the eight referral pathways. The numbers of subsequent cancers were compared with expected cancer incidence in years 1-5 following referral, using standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) based on matched age-gender distributions of expected cancer incidence in England for the same time period. The analysis was repeated, stratifying by referral group, and by calculating the absolute and expected rate of all cancers and of the same individual cancer as the initial referral.\n",

The highest relative risks of subsequent diagnosis of the same cancer as the initial referral pathway were for the head and neck pathway (SIR 3·49 [95% CI 3·22-3·78]) and lung pathway (3·00 [2·82-3·20]).\n",

      "Patients with newly diagnosed high-risk Burkitt lymphoma are treated with high-intensity immune-chemotherapy regimens such as R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC or with lower-intensity regimens such as DA-EPOCH-R. The aim of this study was to make a formal comparison between these regimens.\n",
      "This multicentre, phase 3, open-label, randomised study was done in 26 clinical centres in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk Burkitt lymphoma without CNS involvement. Patients were randomly assigned to two cycles of R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC (R-CODOX-M: rituximab 375 mg/m\n",
      "Due to a slow accrual, the study was closed prematurely on Nov 15, 2021. Between Aug 4, 2014, and Sept 17, 2021, 89 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC (n=46) or DA-EPOCH-R (n=43). Five patients were excluded after random assignment (three in the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group [one diagnosis other than Burkitt lymphoma at study entry according to local pathology and two CNS involvement] and two in the DA-EPOCH-R group [one diagnosis other than Burkitt lymphoma at study entry according to local pathology and one CNS involvement]. 84 remaining patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. 73 (87%) of 84 patients were male, 76 (90%) presented with stage III or IV disease, and nine (11%) had HIV-positive Burkitt lymphoma. Median patient age was 52 years (IQR 37-64). With a median follow-up of 28·5 months (IQR 13·2-43·7), 2-year progression-free survival was 76% (95% CI 60-86%) in the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group and 70% (54-82%) in the DA-EPOCH-R group (hazard ratio 1·42, 95% CI 0·63-3·18; p=0·40). There were two deaths in the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group (one infection [treatment related] and one due to disease progression [not treatment related]) and one death in the DA-EPOCH-R group (COVID-19 infection [treatment related]). In the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group, four patients went off-protocol because of toxic effects, versus none in the DA-EPOCH-R group. Patients treated with R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC had more infectious adverse events (24 [56%] of 43 patients had at least one grade 3-5 infection vs 14 [34%] of 41 patients in the DA-EPOCH-R group).\n",
      "The trial stopped early, but the available data suggest that while DA-EPOCH-R did not result in superior progression-free survival compared with R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC, it was associated with fewer toxic effects and need for supportive care. DA-EPOCH-R appears to be an additional valid therapeutic option for patients with high-risk Burkitt lymphoma without CNS involvement.\n",

      "The diagnosis of synchronous carcinomas, involving both the endometrium and ovaries, is not a rare finding in gynecologic pathology and represents a challenge with implications on tumor staging and therapeutic decision-making. A mono-institutional series of 11 metastatic and 6 paired synchronous endometrial and ovarian carcinomas were reviewed by 2 expert pathologists based on previously published histopathologic criteria. The series was investigated for DNA mismatch repair proteins, p53, and POLE status and was subject to DNA-based next-generation sequencing targeting 67 cancer-related genes. Out of 17 pairs, 16 featured the same histotype (10 endometrioid, 4 serous high-grade, and 2 clear cells). By using WHO 2020 criteria, 11 couples of tumors were confirmed as metastatic and 6 couples were confirmed as independent. Based on next-generation sequencing analysis, 16 of 17 cases (11 metastatic and 5 independent) of our series showed evidence of a clonal relationship between endometrial and ovarian carcinomas. In metastatic cases, the adverse outcome was associated with nonendometrioid/high-grade endometrioid histotype and with the p53-abnormal molecular subtype. Four cases originally fulfilling clinicopathological criteria of independent endometrial and ovarian carcinomas were clonally related, low-grade endometrioid histotype and POLE-mut, mismatch repair deficient, and no specific molecular profile molecular subtypes; no adverse event was recorded in this group. In summary, the molecular characterization of synchronous gynecologic carcinomas confirms their clonal origin in most cases. However, the results of our study point out that the clinical behavior of these tumors seems to be determined by the presence of high-risk WHO 2020 histologic criteria and molecular features (i.e. p53-abnormal), rather than the monoclonal origin.\n",
      "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive, heterogeneous brain tumor in which glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are known culprits of therapy resistance. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play a critical role in both cancer and normal biology. A few studies have suggested that aberrant expression of lncRNAs is associated with GSCs. However, a comprehensive single-cell analysis of the GSC-associated lncRNA transcriptome has not been carried out. Here, we analyzed recently published single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of adult GBM tumors, GBM organoids, GSC-enriched GBM tumors, and developing human brain samples to identify lncRNAs highly expressed in GSCs. We further revealed that the GSC-specific lncRNAs GIHCG and LINC01563 promote proliferation, migration, and stemness in the GSC population. Together, this study identified a panel of uncharacterized GSC-enriched lncRNAs and set the stage for future in-depth studies to examine their role in GBM pathology and their potential as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets in GBM.\n",
      "The elongation stage of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is central to the regulation of gene expression in response to developmental and environmental cues in metazoan. Dysregulated transcriptional elongation has been associated with developmental defects as well as disease and aging processes. Decades of genetic and biochemical studies have painstakingly identified and characterized an ensemble of factors that regulate RNA Pol II elongation. This review summarizes recent findings taking advantage of genetic engineering techniques that probe functions of elongation factors in vivo. We propose a revised model of elongation control in this accelerating field by reconciling contradictory results from the earlier biochemical evidence and the recent in vivo studies. We discuss how elongation factors regulate promoter-proximal RNA Pol II pause release, transcriptional elongation rate and processivity, RNA Pol II stability and RNA processing, and how perturbation of these processes is associated with developmental disorders, neurodegenerative disease, cancer, and aging.\n",
      "When compared to other malignancies, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of primary and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is relatively devoid of immune infiltrates. While androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) induces a complex immune infiltrate in localized prostate cancer, the composition of the TME in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), and the effects of ADT and other treatments in this context are poorly understood. Here, we perform a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling of metastatic sites from patients participating in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03951831) that evaluated standard-of-care chemo-hormonal therapy combined with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We perform a longitudinal, protein activity-based analysis of TME subpopulations, revealing immune subpopulations conserved across multiple metastatic sites. We also observe dynamic changes in these immune subpopulations in response to treatment and a correlation with clinical outcomes. Our study uncovers a therapy-resistant, transcriptionally distinct tumor subpopulation that expands in cell number in treatment-refractory patients.\n",
      "Sequencing of genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, is recommended for individuals with a personal or family history of early onset and/or bilateral breast and/or ovarian cancer or a history of male breast cancer. Such sequencing efforts have resulted in the identification of more than 17,000 BRCA2 variants. The functional significance of most variants remains unknown; consequently, they are called variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUSs). We have previously developed mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-based assays for functional classification of BRCA2 variants. We now developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based approach for functional evaluation of BRCA2 variants using pools of mESCs expressing 10-25 BRCA2 variants from a given exon. We use this approach for functional evaluation of 223 variants listed in ClinVar. Our functional classification of BRCA2 variants is concordant with the classification reported in ClinVar or those reported by other orthogonal assays.\n",
      "Understanding how HIV-1-infected cells proliferate and persist is key to HIV-1 eradication, but the heterogeneity and rarity of HIV-1-infected cells hamper mechanistic interrogations.

      "Mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes move and evict nucleosomes at gene promoters and enhancers to modulate DNA access. Although SWI/SNF subunits are commonly mutated in disease, therapeutic options are limited by our inability to predict SWI/SNF gene targets and conflicting studies on functional significance. Here, we leverage a fast-acting inhibitor of SWI/SNF remodeling to elucidate direct targets and effects of SWI/SNF. Blocking SWI/SNF activity causes a rapid and global loss of chromatin accessibility and transcription. Whereas repression persists at most enhancers, we uncover a compensatory role for the EP400/TIP60 remodeler, which reestablishes accessibility at most promoters during prolonged loss of SWI/SNF. Indeed, we observe synthetic lethality between EP400 and SWI/SNF in cancer cell lines and human cancer patient data. Our data define a set of molecular genomic features that accurately predict gene sensitivity to SWI/SNF inhibition in diverse cancer cell lines, thereby improving the therapeutic potential of SWI/SNF inhibitors.\n",

Walking, moderate-intensity PA (excluding walking), vigorous-intensity PA, moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA, and total PA were estimated as minutes per week, while time spent sitting was assessed in minutes per day. All were modeled with median regression. Meeting PA guidelines or not was modeled using logistic regression.\n",

      "Melatonin has antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, apoptotic, and immunomodulatory properties in ovarian cancer. Considering those, we evaluated the relationship between melatonin 1 (MT1) and melatonin 2 receptor (MT2) expression in tumor tissues of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients who received primary surgical treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer in our clinic between 2000 and 2019 were retrospectively scanned through patient files, electronic databases, and telephone calls. One hundred forty-two eligible patients were included in the study, their tumoral tissues were examined to determine MT1 and MT2 expression by immunohistochemical methods. The percentage of receptor-positive cells and intensity of staining were determined. MT1 receptor expression (P = 0.002 for DFS and P = 0.002 for OS) showed a significant effect on DFS and OS. MT2 expression had no effect on survival (P = 0.593 for DFS and P = 0.209 for OS). The results showed that the higher the MT1 receptor expression, the longer the DFS and OS. It is suggested that melatonin should be considered as adjuvant therapy for ovarian cancer patients in addition to standard treatment, and clinical progress should be observed.\n",
      "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) hold promise for disease risk assessment and prevention. The Genomic Medicine at Veterans Affairs (GenoVA) Study is addressing three main challenges to the clinical implementation of PRSs in preventive care: defining and determining their clinical utility, implementing them in time-constrained primary care settings, and countering their potential to exacerbate healthcare disparities. The study processes used to test patients, report their PRS results to them and their primary care providers (PCPs), and promote the use of those results in clinical decision-making are modeled on common practices in primary care. The following diseases were chosen for their prevalence and familiarity to PCPs: coronary artery disease; type 2 diabetes; atrial fibrillation; and breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) design and primary outcome of time-to-new-diagnosis of a target disease bring methodological rigor to the question of the clinical utility of PRS implementation. The study's pragmatic RCT design enhances its relevance to how PRS might reasonably be implemented in primary care. Steps the study has taken to promote health equity include the thoughtful handling of genetic ancestry in PRS construction and reporting and enhanced recruitment strategies to address underrepresentation in research participation. To date, enhanced recruitment efforts have been both necessary and successful: participants of underrepresented race and ethnicity groups have been less likely to enroll in the study than expected but ultimately achieved proportional representation through targeted efforts. The GenoVA Study experience to date offers insights for evaluating the clinical utility of equitable PRS implementation in adult primary care.\n",
      "Organ regeneration requires dynamic cell interactions to reestablish cell numbers and tissue architecture. While we know the identity of progenitor cells that replace lost tissue, the transient states they give rise to and their role in repair remain elusive. Here, using multiple injury models, we find that alveolar fibroblasts acquire distinct states marked by Sfrp1 and Runx1 that influence tissue remodeling and reorganization. Unexpectedly, ablation of alveolar epithelial type-1 (AT1) cells alone is sufficient to induce tissue remodeling and transitional states. Integrated scRNA-seq followed by genetic interrogation reveals RUNX1 is a key driver of fibroblast states. Importantly, the ectopic induction or accumulation of epithelial transitional states induce rapid formation of transient alveolar fibroblasts, leading to organ-wide fibrosis. Conversely, the elimination of epithelial or fibroblast transitional states or RUNX1 loss, leads to tissue simplification resembling emphysema. This work uncovered a key role for transitional states in orchestrating tissue topologies during regeneration.\n",
      "Most organs have tissue-resident immune cells. Human organoids lack these immune cells, which limits their utility in modeling many normal and disease processes. Here, we describe that pluripotent stem cell-derived human colonic organoids (HCOs) co-develop a diverse population of immune cells, including hemogenic endothelium (HE)-like cells and erythromyeloid progenitors that undergo stereotypical steps in differentiation, resulting in the generation of functional macrophages. HCO macrophages acquired a transcriptional signature resembling human fetal small and large intestine tissue-resident macrophages. HCO macrophages modulate cytokine secretion in response to pro- and anti-inflammatory signals and were able to phagocytose and mount a robust response to pathogenic bacteria. When transplanted into mice, HCO macrophages were maintained within the colonic organoid tissue, established a close association with the colonic epithelium, and were not displaced by the host bone-marrow-derived macrophages. These studies suggest that HE in HCOs gives rise to multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and functional tissue-resident macrophages.\n",

      "Photothermal therapy (PTT) has been extensively studied due to its promising therapeutic effects and potential for development in cancer treatments. Central to PTT is the development of photothermal agents (PTAs). This study presents a novel nanoparticle called POSS-SQ, which satisfies the necessary conditions to function as a PTA. Comprised of squaraine (SQ) and polyhedral oligomeric sesquisiloxane (POSS), POSS-SQ NPs exhibit strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) attributable to the intermolecular electron transfer in SQ. Furthermore, POSS when modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) through \"click\" chemistry, effectively enhances cell permeability and biocompatibility of the nanoparticles. Photothermal experiments reveal that POSS-SQ NPs demonstrate concentration and laser power dependence, with a PCE of 67.2%. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirm the excellent biosafety and tumor growth inhibition potential of POSS-SQ NPs under laser irradiation, attributed to the synergistic effects of enhanced cell permeability and exceptional photothermal properties. This research highlights the possibility of obtaining PTAs with high PCE and excellent biocompatibility by combining SQ-N and POSS, offering a new approach for designing and developing more efficient PTAs to enhance better PTT outcomes.\n",
      "A label-free detection method for noninvasive biofluids enables rapid on-site disease screening and early-stage cancer diagnosis by analyzing metabolic alterations. Herein, we develop three-dimensional plasmonic hexaplex nanostructures coated on a paper substrate (3D-PHP). This flexible and highly absorptive 3D-PHP sensor is integrated with commercial saliva collection tube to create an efficient on-site sensing platform for lung cancer screening via surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurement of human saliva. The multispike hexaplex-shaped gold nanostructure enhances contact with saliva viscosity, enabling effective sampling and SERS enhancement. Through testing patient salivary samples, the 3D-PHP sensor demonstrates successful lung cancer detection and diagnosis. A logistic regression-based machine learning model successfully classifies benign and malignant patients, exhibiting high clinical sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, important Raman peak positions related to different lung cancer stages are investigated, suggesting insights for early-stage cancer diagnosis. Integrating 3D-PHP senor with the conventional saliva collection tube platform is expected to offer promising practicality for rapid on-site disease screening and diagnosis, and significant advancements in cancer detection and patient care.\n",

Matrine, a constituent of the traditional Chinese herb Sophora flavescentis Radix, is known for its anti-cervical cancer properties and ability to induce programmed cell death. The induction of cancer cell ferroptosis, which is a novel cell death pattern, can become an effective clinical therapy for tumor in the future. However, the effect of matrine on ferroptosis in cervical cancer remains to be elucidated.\n",

We meticulously tracked alterations in body weight and tumor size and evaluated liver and kidney health using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Dataset (GSE201309), we evaluated the relationship between the effects of matrine on malignant tumor cells and ferroptosis. In vitro, tetrazolium-based colorimetric (MTT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and colony formation assays were used to study the effects of matrine on SiHa cell activity and cytotoxicity. We assessed ferroptosis-related protein abundance using western blotting and ferroptosis-related indices in cells using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The interaction of matrine with a protein linked to ferroptosis was studied using cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA).

      "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a highly disabling condition that negatively affects the quality of life of millions of women worldwide. However, the underlying mechanisms associated with the development and progression of the disease remain poorly understood. Here, an untargeted four-dimensional data-independent acquisition (4D DIA)-based proteomics approach was applied to vaginal wall tissue samples from POP (n = 19) and control (n = 8) patients to identify potential diagnostic biomarker(s) for POP and examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Of the 5713 tissue proteins that were detected, 1957 proteins were significantly changed in POP patients. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that multiple biological processes including protein digestion & absorption, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, tyrosine metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism were significantly enriched and associated with the pathogenesis of POP. Interestingly, 16 of these differentially expressed proteins associated with four pathways were also identified by targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) proteomics analysis on the same 27 tissue samples. Changes in 94 % (15/16) of these proteins were consistent with the 4D DIA data. Furthermore, most proteins displayed good diagnostic accuracy with high area under the curve (AUC) values (AUC＞0.8). Specifically, five proteins including ELN, COL6A2, ENTPD1, AOC3, and COX7A2 distinguished between POP and control patients with very high accuracy (AUC ≥ 0.95) in both 4D DIA and PRM analyses, and may therefore be potential diagnostic biomarkers for POP. In summary, the present study not only provided several potential biomarker(s) for effective POP diagnosis, but extended our knowledge of the key regulatory pathways associated with the disease.\n",

      "Drug-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can efficiently inhibit tumor growth and recurrence through the release of tumor-associated antigens which activate both local and systemic immune responses. Pyroptosis has emerged as an effective means for inducing ICD; however, the development of novel pyroptosis inducers to specifically target tumor cells remains a pressing requirement. Herein, we report that Cinobufagin (CS-1), a main ingredient of Chansu, can effectively induce pyroptosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, making it a potential therapeutic agent for this kind of tumor. However, the application of CS-1 in vivo is extremely limited by the high dosage/long-term usage and non-selectivity caused by systemic toxicity. To address these drawbacks, we developed a new nanomedicine by loading CS-1 into Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs). The nanomedicine can release CS-1 in a photothermal-controlled manner inherited in PB NPs. Furthermore, hybrid membrane (HM) camouflage was adopted to improve the immune escape and tumor-targeting ability of this nanomedicine, as well. In vitro assays demonstrated that the chemo-photothermal combination treatment produced high-level ICD, ultimately fostering the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). In vivo anti-tumor assessments further indicated that this strategy not only efficiently inhibited primary growth of MDA-MB-231 cells and 4T1 cells-bearing models but also efficiently attenuated distant tumor growth in 4T1 xenograft model. This was mechanistically achieved throuh the promotion of DCs maturation, infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte into the tumor, and the inhibition of Treg cells. In summary, this work provides a novel strategy for efficient TNBC therapy by using nanomaterials-based multimodal nanomedicine through rational design.\n",

Concordance index and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare prognostic values between the 2 systems. The primary outcome was overall survival, and comprehensive survival analyses were performed. The secondary outcomes were short-term survival, malnutrition, and quality of life.\n",
      "During the median follow-up of 17.47 mo, 813 deaths were recorded. The modified Controlling Nutritional Status was more accurate than Controlling Nutritional Status in predicting survival in patients with cancer cachexia.

Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed high Controlling Nutritional Status (hazard ratio = 1.34, 95% CI, 1.13-1.58; P < 0.001) and modified Controlling Nutritional Status (hazard ratio = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.26-1.69; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for survival, adjusting for confounders. In subgroup analyses, a high modified Controlling Nutritional Status score had a significantly negative effect on survival in cachexia patients with upper gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer, especially for advanced-stage (stages III and IV) patients. The risk of short-term mortality and experiencing malnutrition rose to 1.48 and 1.13 times, respectively, in the high modified Controlling Nutritional Status group, as well as that for poorer life quality.\n",

In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the outcomes of surgery and/or RT for the first recurrence/progression of craniopharyngioma after resection alone. The exposure was the treatment that was administered for the first recurrence/progression, and the outcomes were tumor regrowth and overall survival (OS). Subgroup analyses were performed by age at the treatment for the first recurrence/progression (<18 or ≥ 18 years old), duration between the first treatment and the first recurrence/progression (<2 or ≥ 2 years), and the initial treatment that was administered (STR or GTR). Of the 2932 studies screened, 11 studies reporting a total of 80 patients were included. Across almost all subgroups, patients who received RT for the first recurrence/progression had a significantly lower risk of tumor regrowth than those who did not, regardless of whether surgery was performed and the extent of resection. There was no significant association between the treatment administered for the first recurrence/progression and OS, except for patients with a recurrence/progression < 2 years after the first treatment, where GTR was associated with a higher risk of mortality. For patients with the first recurrence/progression of craniopharyngioma after resection alone, RT should be considered for better local control. In cases where RT is not administered, GTR is preferred over STR provided it can be safely performed, for improved local control.\n",
      "Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant bone carcinoma that affects people in childhood and adulthood. The heterogeneous nature and chromosomal instability represent certain characteristics of OS cells. These cancer cells grow and migrate abnormally, making the prognosis undesirable for patients. Conventional and current treatments fail to completely eradicate tumor cells, so new therapeutics targeting genes may be considered. PI3K/Akt is a regulator of events such as growth, cell death, migration, and differentiation, and its expression changes during cancer progression. PTEN reduces PI3K/Akt expression, and its mutations and depletions have been reported in various tumors. Experimental evidence shows that there is upregulation of PI3K/Akt and downregulation of PTEN in OS. Increasing PTEN expression may suppress PI3K/Akt to minimize tumorigenesis. In addition, PI3K/Akt shows a positive association with growth, metastasis, EMT and metabolism of OS cells and inhibits apoptosis. Importantly, overexpression of PI3K/Akt causes drug resistance and radio-resistance and its level can be modulated by miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs. Silencing PI3K/Akt by compounds and drugs can suppress OS. Here, we review in detail the function of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt in OS, revealing its biological function, function in tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and pharmacological significance.\n",
      "Studies have suggested a possible relevance between branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic enzymes and cancers. However, few studies have explored the variation in circulating concentrations of BCAAs. Our study used bi-directional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis for predicting the causality between the BCAA levels and 9 types of cancers.\n",
      "The largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provided data for total BCAAs, valine, leucine, and isoleucine from the UK Biobank. Data on multiple cancer endpoints were collected from various sources, such as the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO), the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium 1 (PanScan1), the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), the FinnGen Biobank, and the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance (OCAC). The mainly analysis method was the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW). For assessing horizontal pleiotropy, the researchers performed MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO global test. Finally, the Cochran's Q test served for evaluating the heterogeneity.\n",

      "Patients with unfavorable carcinoma of unknown primary origin (CUP) have an extremely poor prognosis of ∼1 year or less, stressing the need for more tailored treatments, which are currently being tested in clinical trials. CUPISCO (NCT03498521) was a phase II randomized study of targeted therapy/cancer immunotherapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated, unfavorable CUP, defined as per the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines. We present a preliminary, descriptive molecular analysis of 464 patients with stringently diagnosed, unfavorable CUP enrolled in the CUPISCO study.\n",

      "Neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved event-free survival (EFS) and pathologic complete response (pCR) versus chemotherapy alone in patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the global phase III CheckMate 816 study. Here, we report post hoc exploratory efficacy, safety, and surgical outcomes in the Chinese subpopulation of this study.\n",
      "Adults with stage IB-IIIA resectable NSCLC were randomized to receive nivolumab 360 mg plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone every 3 weeks for three cycles followed by surgery. Primary endpoints included EFS and pCR (both per blinded independent review). EFS and pCR results were from 14 October 2022, and 16 September 2020, database locks, respectively.\n",
      "The Chinese subpopulation comprised 97 patients (nivolumab plus chemotherapy, 44; chemotherapy, 53). At 38.2 months of minimum follow-up, median EFS was not reached [95% confidence interval (CI) 23.4 months-not reached] in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy arm and 13.9 months (95% CI 8.3-34.3 months) in the chemotherapy arm (hazard ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.25-0.88). pCR rates were 25.0% (95% CI 13.2% to 40.3%) and 1.9% (95% CI 0.0% to 10.1%), respectively (odds ratio 11.05; 95% CI 1.41-86.49).

      "Participants were included from the Dutch Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (DCCSS) LATER cohort, a nationwide cohort of CCS (≥5 years after diagnosis) and siblings as controls. Fatigue severity was assessed with the 'fatigue severity subscale' of the Checklist Individual Strength ('CIS-fatigue'). CF was defined as scoring ≥35 on the 'CIS-fatigue' and having fatigue symptoms for ≥6 months. Twenty-four parameters were assessed, categorized into assumed fatigue triggering, maintaining and moderating factors. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to investigate the association of these factors with CF.\n",

      "Peripherally inserted central catheters are widely used in clinical practice. Despite the many advantages of peripherally inserted central catheters, unplanned removals can occur owing to irreversible complications and may have adverse consequences for patients. However, the relationship between peripherally inserted central catheter type and the incidence of unplanned removal is unclear.\n",
      "To investigate the association between the type of peripherally inserted central catheter and unplanned catheter removal.\n",

      "Of the 2436 peripherally inserted central catheters with a proximal valve and 730 that were open-ended, 272 (11.2 %) and 46 (6.3 %) were removed unplanned, respectively. The whole incidence of unplanned removal was 10.04 %; multivariate Cox regression was conducted and it was determined that unplanned removal was statistically significantly associated with the proximal valve peripherally inserted central catheter type (hazard ratio: 1.86, 95 % confidence interval: 1.28 to 2.70, p = 0.001). In patients without cancer, the risk of unplanned removal of peripherally inserted central catheters with a proximal valve was 8.14 times higher than that of open-ended peripherally inserted central catheters (p < 0.001).\n",
      "In this study, peripherally inserted central catheters with a proximal valve had a higher risk of unplanned removals, especially in patients without cancer. The peripherally inserted central catheter type should be considered in advance, and clinical staff should take appropriate measures to prevent unplanned removals after insertion.\n",

      "Nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative realm of exploration across diverse scientific domains. A particular focus lies on metal oxide nanoparticles, which boast distinctive physicochemical attributes on the nanoscale. Of note, green synthesis has emerged as a promising avenue, leveraging plant extracts as both reduction and capping agents. This approach offers environmentally friendly and cost-effective avenues for generating monodispersed nanoparticles with precise morphologies.\n",
      "In this investigation, we embarked on the synthesis of Bismuth oxide nanoparticles, both in their pure form and doped with silver (Ag) and copper (Cu). This synthesis harnessed the potential of Biebersteinia multifida extract as a versatile reducing agent. To comprehensively characterize the synthesized nanoparticles, a suite of analytical techniques was employed, including energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.\n",
      "The synthesized nanoparticles underwent a rigorous assessment. Their antibacterial attributes were probed, revealing a pronounced enhancement in antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria upon metal nanoparticle doping. Furthermore, their potential for combating cancer was scrutinized, with the nanoparticles exhibiting selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, U87, compared to normal 3T3 cells. Notably, among the doped nanoparticles, Cu-doped variants demonstrated the highest potency, further underscoring their promising potential.\n",
      "In conclusion, the present study underscores the efficacy of green synthesized Bismuth oxide nanoparticles, particularly those doped with Ag and Cu, in augmenting antibacterial efficacy, bolstering biofilm inhibition, and manifesting selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells. These findings portend a promising trajectory for these nanoparticles in the spheres of biomedicine and therapeutics. As we look ahead, a deeper elucidation of their mechanistic underpinnings and in vivo investigations are essential to fully unlock their potential for forthcoming biomedical applications.\n",
      "Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology is a disruptive innovation in the drug development community, and over 20 PROTAC molecules are currently under clinical evaluation. These PROTAC molecules contain small-molecule warheads that bind to target proteins. Recently, oligonucleotide-warheaded PROTACs have emerged as a promising new tool to degrade DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors. In this study, we applied an oligonucleotide-warheaded PROTAC technology to induce the degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is a hard-to-target protein. A double-stranded decoy oligonucleotide specific to STAT3 was conjugated to E3 binders (pomalidomide, VH032, and LCL161) to generate PROTAC molecules that recruited different E3 ubiquitin ligases cereblon (CRBN), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), respectively. One of the resulting PROTAC molecules, POM-STAT3, which recruits CRBN, potently induces STAT3 degradation. STAT3 degradation by POM-STAT3 was abolished by scrambling the oligonucleotide sequences of POM-STAT3 and by adding a double-stranded decoy oligonucleotide against STAT3 in a competitive manner, suggesting the significance of oligonucleotide sequences in STAT3 degradation. Moreover, POM-STAT3-induced STAT3 degradation was suppressed by the CRBN binder thalidomide, proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, E1 inhibitor MLN7243, and siRNA-mediated depletion of CRBN, indicating that STAT3 degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which involves CRBN as the responsible E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consistent with STAT3 degradation, NCI-H2087 cell viability was severely reduced following POM-STAT3 treatment. Thus, POM-STAT3 is a STAT3 degrader that potentially has cytocidal activity against cancer cells that are highly dependent on STAT3 signaling, which implies that inducing protein degradation by decoy oligonucleotide-warheaded PROTAC molecules could be harnessed to be therapeutic against oncogenic transcription factors.\n",
      "Currently, cancer is one of the main research topics, due to its high incidence and drug resistance to existing anti-cancer drugs. Formononetin, a natural product with phytoestrogenic properties and diverse biological functions, has attracted the attention of researchers working on anticancer drugs. Formononetin emerges as an intriguing bioactive substance compared to other isoflavones as it exhibits potent chemotherapeutic activity with less toxicity. Formononetin effectively plays a significant role in inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion, and metastatic abilities of cancer cells by targeting major signaling pathways at the junction of interconnected pathways. It also induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by modulating mediator proteins. It causes upregulation of key factors such as p-AKT, p38, p21, and p53 and downregulation of NF-κB. Furthermore, formononetin regulates the neoplastic microenvironment by inactivating the ERK1/2 pathway and lamin A/C signaling and has been reported to inactivate JAK/STAT, PKB or AKT, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and to suppress cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in human cancer cells. To assist researchers in further exploring formononetin as a potential anticancer therapeutic candidate, this review focuses on both in vitro and in vivo proof of concept studies, patents, and clinical trials pertinent to formononetin's anticancer properties. Overall, this review discusses formononetin from a comprehensive perspective to highlight its potential benefits as an anticancer agent.\n",

The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR).\n",
      "35 patients, mostly with bilateral (89%), multiple CRLM (>4, 86%; >10, 46%) were enrolled in eight centers. The ORR was 88% (95% CI, 71%-96%) among evaluable patients (n = 32), and 95% (95% CI 70-100%) among the 22 wild-type RAS/BRAF evaluable patients. After a median follow-up of 8.8 years (95% CI, 8.7-not reached), median progression-free survival was 17.9 months (95% CI, 15-23) and median overall survival (OS) was 46.3 months (95% CI, 40.0-not reached). 23 of the 35 patients (66%), including 22 (79%) of the 25 patients with wild-type RAS tumor, underwent curative-intent surgical resection and/or ablation of CRLM. HAI catheter remained patent in 86% of patients, allowing for a median of eight oxaliplatin infusions (range, 1-19). Treatment toxicity was manageable, without toxic death.\n",

      "This study included 3988 patients diagnosed with invasive EOC between 2014 and 2018, selected from the population-based database of the Belgian Cancer Registry (BCR), and coupled with health insurance and vital status data. The associations between hospital volume and observed survival since diagnosis were assessed with Cox proportional hazard models, while volume associations with 30-day post-operative mortality and complicated recovery were evaluated using logistic regression models.\n",
      "Treatment for EOC was very dispersed with half of the 100 centres treating fewer than six patients per year. The median survival of patients treated in centres with the highest-volume quartile was 2.5 years longer than in those with the lowest-volume quartile (4.2 years versus 1.7 years). When taking the case-mix of hospitals into account, patients treated in the lowest volume centres had a 47% higher hazard to die than patients treated in the highest volume centres (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.11-1.93, p = 0.006) over the first five years after incidence. A similar association was found when focussing on the surgical volume of the hospitals and considering only operated patients with invasive EOC. Lastly, the 30-day post-operative mortality decreased significantly with increasing surgical volume.\n",

      "Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC), a tumor with a significantly increasing incidence, is mostly diagnosed in the head region, where tumors have a worse prognosis and a higher risk of metastases. The presence of metastases reduces specific five-year survival from 99% to 50%. As the risk of occult metastases does not exceed 10%, elective dissection of the tributary parotid and neck lymph nodes is not recommended.\n",
      "We retrospectively analyzed a group of 12 patients with cSCC of the head after elective dissections of regional (parotid and cervical) nodes by means of superficial parotidectomy and selective neck dissection.\n",

      "Our negative opinion on elective parotidectomy and neck dissection in cSCC of the head is in agreement with the majority of published studies. These elective procedures are not indicated even for tumors showing the presence of known (clinical and histological) risk factors for lymphogenic spread, as their positive predictive value is too low. Elective parotidectomy is individually considered as safe deep surgical margin. If elective parotidectomy is planned it should include only the superficial lobe. Completion parotidectomy and elective neck dissection are done in rare cases of histologically confirmed parotid metastasis in the parotid specimen. Preoperatively diagnosed parotid metastases without neck involvement are sent for total parotidectomy and elective selective neck dissection. Cases of clinically evident neck metastasis with no parotid involvement, are referred for comprehensive neck dissection and elective superficial parotidectomy. The treatment of concurrent parotid and cervical metastases includes total conservative parotidectomy and comprehensive neck dissection.\n",

Further, subgroup analysis showed that the expression of IL-36γ had no correlation with the OS of colorectal cancer (CRC) and non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Interestingly, a high expression of IL-36γ played contrasting prognostic roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (HR = 0.43, 95 %CI: 0.27-0.69, P < 0.001) patients and gastric cancer (GC) (HR = 1.58, 95 %CI: 1.33-1.87, P < 0.001) patients.

      "Uterine segmentation of endometrial cancer MR images can be a valuable diagnostic tool for gynecologists. However, uterine segmentation based on deep learning relies on artificial pixel-level annotation, which is time-consuming, laborious and subjective. To reduce the dependence on pixel-level annotation, a method of weakly supervised uterine segmentation on endometrial cancer MRI slices is proposed, which only requires scribble label and is enhanced by pseudo-label technology, exponential geodesic distance loss and input disturbance strategy. Specifically, the limitations caused by the shortage of supervision are addressed by dynamically mixing the two outputs of the dual branch network to generate pseudo-labels, expanding supervision information and promoting mutual supervision training. On the other hand, considering the large difference of grayscale intensity between the uterus and surrounding tissues, the exponential geodesic distance loss is introduced to enhance the ability of the network to capture the edge of the uterus. Input disturbance strategies are incorporated to adapt to the flexible and variable characteristics of the uterus and further improve the segmentation performance of the network. The proposed method is evaluated on MRI images from 135 cases of endometrial cancer. Compared with other four weakly supervised segmentation methods, the performance of the proposed method is the best, whose mean DI, HD\n",
      "Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical assistance for diagnosis. The UNet-based network architecture has achieved tremendous success in the field of medical image segmentation. However, most methods commonly employ element-wise addition or channel merging to fuse features, resulting in smaller differentiation of feature information and excessive redundancy. Consequently, this leads to issues such as inaccurate lesion localization and blurred boundaries in segmentation. To alleviate these problems, the Multi-scale Subtraction and Multi-key Context Conversion Networks (MSMCNet) are proposed for medical image segmentation. Through the construction of differentiated contextual representations, MSMCNet emphasizes vital information and achieves precise medical image segmentation by accurately localizing lesions and enhancing boundary perception. Specifically, the construction of differentiated contextual representations is accomplished through the proposed Multi-scale Non-crossover Subtraction (MSNS) module and Multi-key Context Conversion Module (MCCM). The MSNS module utilizes the context of MCCM coding and redistribute the value of feature map pixels. Extensive experiments were conducted on widely used public datasets, including the ISIC-2018 dataset, COVID-19-CT-Seg dataset, Kvasir dataset, as well as a privately constructed traumatic brain injury dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed MSMCNet outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods across different evaluation metrics.\n",

      "Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess risk factors for screening positive for precancerous lesions. In a separate analysis, factors associated with treatment delay were assessed among women enrolled in the palliative care program.\n",
      "Three thousand nine hundred forty-six women were included from the screening program and 334 from the palliative care program. In total, 7.6% of screening participants had precancerous lesions. Within Busoga Region, the highest positivity rate was found in Bugweri and Namayingo Districts. Abnormal vaginal bleeding (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-2.21; p = 0.005) and older age at first menstrual period (aOR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.16; p = 0.03) were associated with having a precancerous lesion.

      "Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (BRCA) is the most commonly diagnosed molecular subtype of BRCA. It is routinely treated with endocrine therapy; however, some patients relapse after therapy and develop drug resistance, resulting in treatment failure. In the present study, we identified markers of ER-positive BRCA and evaluated their putative function in immune infiltration as well as their clinicopathological significance. The ubiquitin family domain containing 1 (UBFD1) protein was associated with the prognosis of ER-positive BRCA patients. Its expression was higher in ER-positive BRCA tissues compared with adjacent nontumor tissues. Patients with higher UBFD1 expression had a poorer prognosis. UBFD1 is an independent risk factor for ER-positive BRCA patients and its function was primarily associated with hormone activity and inflammation. Taken together, UBFD1 is a potential prognostic biomarker and candidate target of ER-positive BRCA.\n",
      "Metals have been used for many years in medicine, particularly for the treatment of cancer. Cisplatin is one of the most used drugs in the treatment of cancer. Although platinum-containing therapeutics have unparalleled efficacy in cancer treatment, they are coupled with adverse effects and the development of tumour resistance. This has led to the exploration of other metal-based modalities including ruthenium-based compounds. Thus, in our previous study, we synthesized and characterized a novel ruthenium (II) complex (referred to herein as GA113) containing a bis-amino-phosphine ligand. The complex was subsequently screened for its anti-cancerous potential against a human malignant melanoma A375 cell line and findings revealed favourable cytotoxicity. In the current study, a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based cellular metabolomics approach was applied to probe the possible mechanism of GA113 in A375 cells. In addition, other biological assays including light microscopy, Hoechst-33258 and MitoTracker Orange CM-H\n",
      "There are multiple treatment strategies that have been reported for breast cancer, while new and effective therapies against it are still necessary. Stimulating the immune system and its components against cancer cells is one of the unique treatment strategies of immunotherapy and long dsRNAs are immunostimulant in this regard. Based on bioinformatics approaches, a fragment of the Rice ragged stunt RNA virus genome was selected and synthesized according to its immunogenicity. Based on the in vitro transcription technique, dsRNA was synthesized and its binding ability to the PEI/PEI-Ac Polyethylenimine (PEI) or Acetylated polyethylenimine (PEI-Ac) was verified by the gel retardation assay. Then, the PEI-Ac was synthesized by adding acetyl groups to the PEI, and the results of the \n",
      "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway plays a central role in cell growth and survival and is disturbed in various pathologies. The PI3K is a kinase that generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI (3-5) P3), as a second messenger responsible for the translocation of AKT to the plasma membrane and its activation. However, due to the crucial role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in regulation of cell survival processes, it has been introduced as a main therapeutic target for natural compounds during the progression of different pathologies. Berberine, a plant-derived isoquinone alkaloid, is known because of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antitumor properties. The effect of this natural compound on cell survival processes has been shown to be mediated by modulation of the intracellular pathways. However, the effects of this natural compound on the PI3K/AKT pathway in various pathologies have not been reviewed so far. Therefore, this paper aims to review the PI3K/AKT-mediated effects of Berberine in different types of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and central nervous system diseases.\n",

      "Live imaging of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM) provides vital insights into changes that occur in neurological disorders. Current techniques such as second or third-harmonic generation offer limited contrast for live imaging of the brain ECM. Here, a new method, pan-ECM via chemical labeling of extracellular proteins, is introduced for live brain ECM imaging. pan-ECM labels all major ECM components in live tissue including the interstitial matrix, basement membrane, and perineuronal nets. pan-ECM enables in vivo observation of the ECM heterogeneity between the glioma core and margin, as well as the assessment of ECM deterioration under stroke condition, without ECM shrinkage from tissue fixation. These findings indicate that the pan-ECM approach is a novel way to image the entire brain ECM in live brain tissue with optical resolution. pan-ECM has the potential to advance the understanding of ECM in brain function and neurological diseases.\n",

      "Hi-C and RNA-seq were applied to study the 3D chromatin landscapes and gene expression of HCC and ANHT. Hi-C Pro was used to generate genome-wide raw interaction matrices, which were normalized via iterative correction (ICE). Moreover, the chromosomes were divided into different compartments according to the first principal component (E1). Furthermore, topologically associated domains (TADs) were visualized via WashU Epigenome Browser. Furthermore, differential expression analysis of ANHT and HCC was performed using the DESeq2 R package. Additionally, dysregulated genes associated with 3D genome architecture altered were confirmed using TCGA, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC), etc. RESULTS: First, the intrachromosomal interactions of chr1, chr2, chr5, and chr11 were significantly different, and the interchromosomal interactions of chr4-chr10, chr13-chr21, chr15-chr22, and chr16-chr19 are remarkably different between ANHT and HCC, which resulted in the up-regulation of TP53I3 and ZNF738 and the down-regulation of APOC3 and APOA5 in HCC. Second, 49 compartment regions on 18 chromosomes have significantly switched (A-B or B-A) during HCC tumorigenesis, contributing to up-regulation of RAP2A. Finally, a tumor-specific TAD boundary located on chr5: 6271000-6478000 and enhancer hijacking were identified in HCC tissues, potentially associated with the elevated expression of MED10, whose expression were associated with poor prognosis of HCC patients.\n",

      "Little is known regarding the patterns of trust sources for cancer information among diverse populations in the US, which is particularly poignant during the current era of misinformation. Our objective to assess trust from different sources among a sample of Brooklyn, New York residents. Using data from the NCI funded Brooklyn Cancer Health Impact Program, we examined HINTS validated questions examining trust in cancer information across 9 sources. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations with cancer information trust sources. For trust in government health agencies, participants who had less than a college degree were almost 30% less likely to report high levels of trust (aOR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.52-0.98), participants who reported a household income under $50,000 were 35% less likely report high levels of trust (aOR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.47-0.89). Participants whose primary language was Spanish were significantly less likely to trust government (aOR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.29-0.70), newspapers and magazines (aOR: 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.84), and charitable organizations (aOR: 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.75) compared to participants whose primary was English.

      "The levels of circ_0013339, miR-136-5p, and SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9) in CRC were gauged by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Colony formation and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were used to detect cell proliferation. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay was used to measure cell viability. Western blot assay was performed to examine protein expression. The relationship between miR-136-5p and circ_0013339 or SOX9 was tested by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The effect of sh-circ_0013339 on tumor growth in vivo was examined by xenograft experiments.\n",

      "Insulinomas are hormone-producing pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNEN) with an estimated incidence of 1-4 cases per million per year. Extrapancreatic insulinomas are extremely rare. Most insulinomas present with Whipple's triad: 1) symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia, 2) a low plasma glucose measured at the time of the symptoms and signs, and 3) relief of symptoms and signs when the glucose is raised to normal. Non-metastatic insulinomas are nowadays referred to as \"indolent\" and metastatic insulinomas as \"aggressive\". The 5-years-survival of patients with an indolent insulinoma has been reported to be 94-100% and for patients with an aggressive insulinoma this amounts to 24-67%. Five-10% of insulinomas are associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. Localization of the insulinoma and exclusion or confirmation of metastatic disease by CT is followed by EUS or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for indolent, localized insulinomas. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) PET/CT or PET/MRI is a highly sensitive localization technique for seemingly occult, indolent, localized insulinomas. Supportive measures and somatostatin receptor ligands can be used for the control of the hypoglycemias. For single solitary insulinomas, curative surgical excision remains the treatment of choice. In aggressive malignant cases, debulking procedures, somatostatin receptor ligands, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, Everolimus, Sunitinib and cytotoxic chemotherapy can be valuable options.\n",
      "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer that coincides with gastric cancer (GC). Although the usefulness of total colonoscopy (TCS) as a CRC screening tool has been reported in preoperative patients with GC, the long-term outcome of patients with synchronous CRC (SCRC) remains unclear. This study aims to clarify the significance of preoperative screening TCS for GC in terms of survival outcomes.\n",
      "We included 796 patients who underwent preoperative screening TCS for GC. The risk factors, clinicopathological features, and survival outcome of SCRC were examined. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness was evaluated from the perspective of improving the rates of mortality caused by CRC.\n",
      "SCRC was observed in 43 patients (5.4%). Endoscopic treatment for SCRC was performed on 30 patients. In total, 15 patients underwent surgical resection, including 2 patients requiring additional surgery after endoscopic treatment. Regarding pathological stages, 25 patients had stage 0, 12 patients had stage I, 5 patients had stage II, and 1 patient had stage IIIB disease. The cumulative mortality rates were as follows: GC-related deaths, 12.6%; deaths from cancers other than CRC, 1%; deaths from other causes, 5.5%. No deaths were attributed to SCRC. Comparing the patients who did not undergo TCS, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis suggested that a screening cost of 5.86 million yen was required to prevent one CRC death.\n",
      "Curative treatment was possible in all patients with SCRC. No deaths were attributed to SCRC, suggesting that screening TCS for GC is effective.\n",
      "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive, deadly malignancy. Resection remains the primary treatment; however, there is conflicting evidence regarding the optimal approach to and extent of surgery and the role of adjuvant therapy. We evaluated the impact of surgical technique and adjuvant therapies on survival in non-metastatic ACC.\n",
      "We performed a retrospective cohort study of subjects who underwent surgery for non-metastatic ACC between 2010 and 2019 utilizing the National Cancer Database. The primary outcome was overall survival. Cox proportional hazards models were developed to identify associations between clinical and treatment characteristics and survival.\n",
      "Overall, 1175 subjects were included. Their mean age was 54 ± 15 years, and 62% of patients were female. 67% of procedures were performed via the open approach, 22% involved multi-organ resection, and 26% included lymphadenectomy. Median survival was 77.1 months. Age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.019; p < 0.001), advanced stage (stage III HR 2.421; p < 0.001), laparoscopic approach (HR 1.329; p = 0.010), and positive margins (HR 1.587; p < 0.001) were negatively associated with survival, while extent of resection (HR 1.189; p = 0.140) and lymphadenectomy (HR 1.039; p = 0.759) had no association. Stratified by stage, laparoscopic resection was only associated with worse survival in stage III disease (HR 1.548; p = 0.007). Chemoradiation was only associated with improved survival in patients with positive resection margins (HR 0.475; p = 0.004).\n",
      "Tumor biology and surgical margins are the primary determinants of survival in non-metastatic ACC. Surgical extent and lymphadenectomy are not associated with overall survival. In advanced disease, the open approach is associated with improved survival.\n",

      "This was a retrospective study that included 454 patients who underwent radical surgery (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2), and 26 patients who received EM (Cohort 3). Utilizing a multivariate logistic regression model, a nomogram predicting LG-NMI UTUC was developed based on data from Cohort 1. The nomogram's accuracy was compared with conventional European Association of Urology (EAU) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) models. External validation was performed using Cohort 2 data, and the nomogram's prognostic value was evaluated via disease progression metrics in Cohort 3.\n",
      "In Cohort 1, multivariate analyses highlighted the absence of invasive disease on imaging (odds ratio [OR] 7.04; p = 0.011), absence of hydronephrosis (OR 2.06; p = 0.027), papillary architecture (OR 24.9; p < 0.001), and lack of high-grade urine cytology (OR 0.22; p < 0.001) as independent predictive factors for LG-NMI disease. The nomogram outperformed the two conventional models in predictive accuracy (0.869 vs. 0.759-0.821) and exhibited a higher net benefit in decision curve analysis. The model's clinical efficacy was corroborated in Cohort 2. Moreover, the nomogram stratified disease progression-free survival rates in Cohort 3.\n",

      "According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) algorithm, tumor burden and liver function, but not tumor biology, are the key factors in determining tumor staging and treatment modality, and evaluating treatment prognosis. The serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) level is an important characteristic of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biology, and we aimed to evaluate its prognostic value for patients undergoing liver resection of early-stage HCC.\n",
      "Patients who underwent curative liver resection for early-stage HCC were identified from a multi-institutional database. Patients were divided into three groups according to preoperative AFP levels: low (< 400 ng/mL), high (400-999 ng/mL), and extremely-high (≥ 1000 ng/mL) AFP groups. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence rates were compared among these three groups.\n",
      "Among 1284 patients, 720 (56.1%), 262 (20.4%), and 302 (23.5%) patients had preoperative low, high, and extremely-high AFP levels, respectively. The cumulative 5-year OS and recurrence rates were 71.3 and 38.9% among patients in the low AFP group, 66.3 and 48.5% in the high AFP group, and 45.7 and 67.2% in the extremely-high AFP group, respectively (both p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified both high and extremely-high AFP levels to be independent risk factors of OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.275 and 1.978, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.004-1.620 and 1.588-2.464, respectively; p = 0.047 and p < 0.001, respectively) and recurrence (HR 1.290 and 2.050, 95% CI 1.047-1.588 and 1.692-2.484, respectively; p = 0.017 and p < 0.001, respectively).\n",

      "We prospectively enrolled 112 patients with LAGC who received NACT from January 2021 to August 2022. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 98 patients were randomized 7:3 to the training cohort (n = 68) and validation cohort (n = 30). We established and compared three radiomics signatures based on three phases of CT images before and after NACT, namely radiomics-baseline, radiomics-delta, and radiomics-restage. Then, we developed a clinical model, DL model, and a nomogram to predict the response of LAGC after NACT. We evaluated the predictive accuracy and clinical validity of each model using the receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis, respectively.\n",
      "The radiomics-delta signature was the best predictor among the three radiomics signatures. So, we developed and validated a DL delta radiomics nomogram (DLDRN). In the validation cohort, the DLDRN produced an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.96) and demonstrated adequate differentiation of good response to NACT. Furthermore, the DLDRN significantly outperformed the clinical model and DL model (p < 0.001). The clinical utility of the DLDRN was confirmed through decision curve analysis.\n",

      "To analyze interventions implemented at the time of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, or among individuals who have previously undergone investigation for CRC, focused on reducing CRC risk through promotion of lifestyle behavior change. Additionally, this review evaluated to what extent such interventions apply behavior change techniques (BCTs) to achieve their objectives.\n",
      "Five databases were systematically searched to identify randomized control trials seeking to reduce CRC risk through behavior change. Outcomes were changes in health-related lifestyle behaviors associated with CRC risk, including changes in dietary habits, body mass index, smoking behaviors, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models. BCT's were coded from a published taxonomy of 93 techniques.\n",

Greater increase in fruit/vegetable consumption in the intervention group were observed with respect to the control (SMD 0.13, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.18; p < 0.001). Across fiber, alcohol, fat, red meat, and multivitamin consumption, and smoking behaviors, similar positive outcomes were observed (SMD 0.09-0.57 for all, p < 0.01). However, among physical activity and body mass index, no difference between the intervention groups compared with controls were observed. A median of 7.5 BCTs were applied across included interventions.\n",

      "Five patients (mean age: 74.0 ± 6.1 years, 40.0% male, 40.0% former smokers) underwent a biopsy. Persistent or recurrent granulation led to a second biopsy in 4 patients an average of 1423.5 days later, revealing a new diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ in one and mild dysplasia in another. Further persistence or recurrence led to a third biopsy or excision an average of 302.3 days later in 3 patients, demonstrating SCC in situ in 1. An average of 2.5 biopsies were required with a mean time to SCC in situ diagnosis of 919.5 days from presentation. Two patients continued to demonstrate persistent granulation tissue on histology.\n",
      "The membranous vocal fold is an atypical location for granuloma and portends a risk of occult malignancy. The occurrence of de novo granuloma at this site should prompt close long-term clinical surveillance with a low threshold for biopsy. Consideration should be given to tissue collection in the operating room to adequately sample the lesion's base. Concern should persist even after a negative biopsy, and serial observation with repeat biopsy as needed should be pursued.\n",
      "Lung cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for the majority of cases. Patients with NSCLC have achieved great survival benefits from immunotherapies targeting immune checkpoints. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are frequently used for palliation of cancer-associated symptoms, as supportive care for non-cancer-associated symptoms, and for management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The aim of this study was to clarify the safety and prognostic significance of glucocorticoid use in advanced patients with NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).\n",
      "The study searched publications from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database up to March 1st, 2022, and conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effects of glucocorticoid use on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs through the available data. The study calculated the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n",
      "This study included data from 25 literatures that were mainly retrospective, with 8713 patients included. Patients taking GCs had a higher risk for tumor progression and death compared with those not taking GCs (PFS: HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.33-1.86, P <0.001; OS: HR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.41-1.88, P <0.001). GCs used for cancer-associated symptoms caused an obviously negative effect on both PFS and OS (PFS: HR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.32-2.29, P <0.001; OS: HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.52-2.04, P <0.001). However, GCs used for irAEs management did not negatively affect prognosis (PFS: HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.46-1.00, P = 0.050; OS: HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34-0.83, P = 0.005), and GCs used for non-cancer-associated indications had no effect on prognosis (PFS: HR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.63-1.32, P = 0.640; OS: HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.59-1.41, P = 0.680).\n",
      "In advanced NSCLC patients treated with ICIs, the use of GCs for palliation of cancer-associated symptoms may result in a worse PFS and OS, indicating that they increase the risk of tumor progression and death. But, in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs, the use of GCs for the management of irAEs may be safe, and the use of GCs for the treatment of non-cancer-associated symptoms may not affect the ICIs' survival benefits. Therefore, it is necessary to be careful and evaluate indications rationally before administering GCs in individualized clinical management.\n",
      "TGFB1, which encodes TGF-β1, a potent cytokine regulating varies cellular processes including immune responses. TGF-β1 plays context-dependent roles in cancers and is increasingly recognized as a therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy responses. We comprehensively evaluated expression of TGFB1 and its clinical and biological effects across hematological malignancies. TGFB1 expression was first explored using data from the GTEx, CCLE, and TCGA databases. The expression and clinical significances of TGFB1 in hematological malignancies were analyzed using Hemap and our In Silico curated datasets. We also analyzed the relationship between TGFB1 with immune scores and immune cell infiltrations in Hemap. We further assessed the value of TGFB1 in predicting immunotherapy response using TIDE and real-world immunotherapy datasets. TGFB1 showed a hematologic-tissue-specific expression pattern both across normal tissues and cancer types. TGFB1 expression were broadly dysregulated in blood cancers and generally associated with adverse prognosis. TGFB1 expression were associated with distinct TME properties among different blood cancer types. In addition, TGFB1 expression was found to be a useful marker in predicting immunotherapy responses. Our results suggest that TGFB1 is broadly dysregulated in hematological malignancies. TGFB1 might regulate the immune microenvironment in a cancer-type-specific manner, which could be applied in the development of new targeted drugs for immunotherapy.\n",
      "Exposure to heavy metals in contaminated drinking water is strongly correlated with various cancers, highlighting the burden of disease. This study aimed to assess the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks associated with exposure to heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in drinking water of Fars province and evaluate the attributed burden of disease. Non-carcinogenic risk assessment was performed using the hazard quotient (HQ) method, while the carcinogenic risk assessment utilized the excess lifetime cancer risk approach. The burden of disease was evaluated in terms of years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for three specific cancers: skin, lung, and kidney cancer. The average drinking water concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) were determined to be 0.72, 0.4, 1.10 and 0.72 μg/L, respectively. The total average HQ of heavy metals in drinking water in the study area were 0.127, 0.0047, 0.0009 and 0.0069, respectively. The average ILCRs of heavy metal in the entire country were in the following order: 1.15 × 10\n",
      "In an observational study conducted from 2016 to 2021, we assessed the utility of radiomics in differentiating between benign and malignant lung nodules detected on computed tomography (CT) scans. Patients in whom a final diagnosis regarding the lung nodules was available according to histopathology and/or 2017 Fleischner Society guidelines were included. The radiomics workflow included lesion segmentation, region of interest (ROI) definition, pre-processing, and feature extraction. Employing random forest feature selection, we identified ten important radiomic features for distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules. Among the classifiers tested, the Decision Tree model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 79% accuracy, 75% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 82% precision, and 90% F1 score. The implementation of the XGBoost algorithm further enhanced these results, yielding 89% accuracy, 89% sensitivity, 89% precision, and an F1 score of 89%, alongside a specificity of 85%. Our findings highlight tumor texture as the primary predictor of malignancy, emphasizing the importance of texture-based features in computational oncology. Thus, our study establishes radiomics as a powerful, non-invasive adjunct to CT scans in the differentiation of lung nodules, with significant implications for clinical decision-making, especially for indeterminate nodules, and the enhancement of diagnostic and predictive accuracy in this clinical context.\n",
      "We compared the predictive ability of the International Prognostic Index (IPI), a frequently used prognostic model for peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), with that of a type-specific prognostic model, the Prognostic Index for PTCL-U (PIT). We retrospectively analyzed 113 patients diagnosed with PTCL. The median age was 67 years (range, 16-88 years), 75 patients (66%) were male, and the most common disease type was PTCL, not otherwise specified (69%). With a median follow-up of 6.8 years (interquartile range, 2.7-9.9 years), 5-year survival rates for the four groups in IPI were 85%, 62%, 49%, and 13%, respectively. Similarly, 5-year survival rates for the four groups in PIT were 83%, 64%, 49%, and 19%, respectively. The area under the receiving operating characteristic curve for predicting mortality from PIT (0.725) was not significantly different from that from the IPI (0.685, P = 0.134). Multivariable analysis showed that performance status ≥ 2 (P < 0.0001) and extranodal lesions ≥ 2 (P = 0.029) were significantly associated with lower overall survival. The present study found no significant difference in prognostic ability between the IPI and PIT for PTCL, and both models appear useful as predictive models.\n",
      "Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomere maintenance mechanism activated in ~10-15% of cancers, characterized by telomeric damage. Telomeric damage-induced long non-coding RNAs (dilncRNAs) are transcribed at dysfunctional telomeres and contribute to telomeric DNA damage response (DDR) activation and repair. Here we observed that telomeric dilncRNAs are preferentially elevated in ALT cells. Inhibition of C-rich (teloC) dilncRNAs with antisense oligonucleotides leads to DNA replication stress responses, increased genomic instability, and apoptosis induction selectively in ALT cells. Cell death is dependent on DNA replication and is increased by DNA replication stress. Mechanistically, teloC dilncRNA inhibition reduces RAD51 and 53BP1 recruitment to telomeres, boosts the engagement of BIR machinery, and increases C-circles and telomeric sister chromatid exchanges, without increasing telomeric non-S phase synthesis. These results indicate that teloC dilncRNA is necessary for a coordinated recruitment of DDR factors to ALT telomeres and it is essential for ALT cancer cells survival.\n",
      "CYP2C19-guided voriconazole dosing reduces pharmacokinetic variability, but many patients remain subtherapeutic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of candidate genes and a novel CYP2C haplotype on voriconazole trough concentrations in patients receiving CYP2C19-guided dosing. This is a retrospective candidate gene study in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients receiving CYP2C19-guided voriconazole dosing. Patients were genotyped for ABCB1, ABCG2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and the CYP2C haplotype. Of 185 patients, 36% were subtherapeutic (of which 79% were normal or intermediate metabolizers). In all patients, CYP2C19 (p < 0.001), age (p = 0.018), and letermovir use (p = 0.001) were associated with voriconazole concentrations. In the subset receiving 200 mg daily (non-RM/UMs), CYP2C19 (p = 0.004) and ABCG2 (p = 0.015) were associated with voriconazole concentrations; CYP2C19 (p = 0.028) and letermovir use (p = 0.001) were associated with subtherapeutic status. CYP2C19 phenotype and letermovir use were significantly associated with subtherapeutic voriconazole concentrations and may be used to improve voriconazole precision dosing, while further research is needed to clarify the role of ABCG2 in voriconazole dosing.\n",

      "miRNAs analysis was performed in two phases: screening phase, with a total n = 40 (10 controls and 30 BC cases) analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing, and validation phase, which included 131 controls and 269 cases. For this second phase, the miRNAs were selected combining the screening phase results and a revision of the literature. They were quantified using RT-PCR. Models were built using logistic regression with LASSO penalization.\n",
      "The model for all cases included seven miRNAs (miR-423-3p, miR-139-5p, miR-324-5p, miR-1299, miR-101-3p, miR-186-5p and miR-29a-3p); which had an area under the ROC curve of 0.73. The model for cases diagnosed via screening only took in one miRNA (miR-101-3p); the area under the ROC curve was 0.63. The model for disease-free cases in the follow-up had five miRNAs (miR-101-3p, miR-186-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-142-3p and miR-1299) and the area under the ROC curve was 0.73. Finally, the model for cases with active disease in the follow-up contained six miRNAs (miR-101-3p, miR-423-3p, miR-139-5p, miR-1307-3p, miR-331-3p and miR-21-3p) and its area under the ROC curve was 0.82.\n",

      "Untargeted serum metabolomics was combined with machine learning-powered data analytics to develop a test for the concurrent detection of multiple cancers in women. A total of fifteen cancers were tested where the resulting metabolome data was sequentially analysed using two separate algorithms. The first algorithm successfully identified all the cancer-positive samples with an overall accuracy of > 99%. This result was particularly significant given that the samples tested were predominantly from early-stage cancers. Samples identified as cancer-positive were next analysed using a multi-class algorithm, which then enabled accurate discernment of the tissue of origin for the individual samples. Integration of serum metabolomics with appropriate data analytical tools, therefore, provides a powerful screening platform for early-stage cancers.\n",
      "Work circumstances can substantially negatively impact health. To explore this, large occupational cohorts of free-text job descriptions are manually coded and linked to exposure. Although several automatic coding tools have been developed, accurate exposure assessment is only feasible with human intervention.\n",
      "We developed OPERAS, a customizable decision support system for epidemiological job coding. Using 812,522 entries, we developed and tested classification models for the Professions et Catégories Socioprofessionnelles (PCS)2003, Nomenclature d'Activités Française (NAF)2008, International Standard Classifications of Occupation (ISCO)-88, and ISCO-68. Each code comes with an estimated correctness measure to identify instances potentially requiring expert review. Here, OPERAS' decision support enables an increase in efficiency and accuracy of the coding process through code suggestions. Using the Formaldehyde, Silica, ALOHA, and DOM job-exposure matrices, we assessed the classification models' exposure assessment accuracy.\n",
      "We show that, using expert-coded job descriptions as gold standard, OPERAS realized a 0.66-0.84, 0.62-0.81, 0.60-0.79, and 0.57-0.78 inter-coder reliability (in Cohen's Kappa) on the first, second, third, and fourth coding levels, respectively. These exceed the respective inter-coder reliability of expert coders ranging 0.59-0.76, 0.56-0.71, 0.46-0.63, 0.40-0.56 on the same levels, enabling a 75.0-98.4% exposure assessment accuracy and an estimated 19.7-55.7% minimum workload reduction.\n",
      "OPERAS secures a high degree of accuracy in occupational classification and exposure assessment of free-text job descriptions, substantially reducing workload. As such, OPERAS significantly outperforms both expert coders and other current coding tools. This enables large-scale, efficient, and effective exposure assessment securing healthy work conditions.\n",
      "Work can expose us to health risks, such as asbestos and constant noise. To study these risks, job descriptions are collected and classified by experts to standard codes. This is time-consuming, expensive, and requires expert knowledge. To improve this coding, we created computer code based on Artificial Intelligence that can both automate this process and suggest codes to experts, who can then check and change it manually if needed. Our system outperforms both expert coders and other available tools. This system could make studying occupational health risks more efficient and accurate, resulting in safer work environments.\n",
      "As observed in cancers, individual mutagens and defects in DNA repair create distinctive mutational signatures that combine to form context-specific spectra within cells. We reasoned that similar processes must occur in bacterial lineages, potentially allowing decomposition analysis to detect both disruption of DNA repair processes and exposure to niche-specific mutagens. Here we reconstruct mutational spectra for 84 clades from 31 diverse bacterial species and find distinct mutational patterns. We extract signatures driven by specific DNA repair defects using hypermutator lineages, and further deconvolute the spectra into multiple signatures operating within different clades. We show that these signatures are explained by both bacterial phylogeny and replication niche. By comparing mutational spectra of clades from different environmental and biological locations, we identify niche-associated mutational signatures, and then employ these signatures to infer the predominant replication niches for several clades where this was previously obscure. Our results show that mutational spectra may be associated with sites of bacterial replication when mutagen exposures differ, and can be used in these cases to infer transmission routes for established and emergent human bacterial pathogens.\n",
      "Soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive mesenchymal-origin malignancies. Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) belongs to the aggressive, high-grade, and least characterized sarcoma subtype, affecting multiple tissues and metastasizing to many organs. The treatment of localized UPS includes surgery in combination with radiation therapy. Metastatic forms are treated with chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is a promising treatment modality for many cancers. However, the development of immunotherapy for UPS is limited due to its heterogeneity, antigenic landscape variation, lower infiltration with immune cells, and a limited number of established patient-derived UPS cell lines for preclinical research. In this study, we established and characterized a novel patient-derived UPS cell line, JBT19. The JBT19 cells express PD-L1 and collagen, a ligand of the immune checkpoint molecule LAIR-1. JBT19 cells can form spheroids in vitro and solid tumors in immunodeficient nude mice. We found JBT19 cells induce expansion of JBT19-reactive autologous and allogeneic NK, T, and NKT-like cells, and the reactivity of the expanded cells was associated with cytotoxic impact on JBT19 cells. The PD-1 and LAIR-1 ligand-expressing JBT19 cells show ex vivo immunogenicity and effective in vivo xenoengraftment properties that can offer a unique resource in the preclinical research developing novel immunotherapeutic interventions in the treatment of UPS.\n",
      "Adjuvants and antigen delivery kinetics can profoundly influence B cell responses and should be critically considered in rational vaccine design, particularly for difficult neutralizing antibody targets such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Antigen kinetics can change depending on the delivery method. To promote extended immunogen bioavailability and to present antigen in a multivalent form, native-HIV Env trimers are modified with short phosphoserine peptide linkers that promote tight binding to aluminum hydroxide (pSer:alum). Here we explore the use of a combined adjuvant approach that incorporates pSer:alum-mediated antigen delivery with potent adjuvants (SMNP, 3M-052) in an extensive head-to-head comparison study with conventional alum to assess germinal center (GC) and humoral immune responses. Priming with pSer:alum plus SMNP induces additive effects that enhance the magnitude and persistence of GCs, which correlate with better GC-T\n",
      "Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a lethal disease with surgical resection as the only curative treatment. However, many patients are ineligible for surgery, and current adjuvant treatments exhibit limited effectiveness. Next-generation sequencing has improved our understanding of molecular pathways in cancer, sparking interest in microRNA-based gene regulation. The aim of the study is to identify dysregulated miRNAs in GBC and investigate their potential as therapeutic tools for effective and targeted treatment strategies. GBC and control tissue samples were sequenced for miRNA expression using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Biological processes and related pathways were determined using the Panther and Gene Ontology databases. 439 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were identified; 19 of them were upregulated and 29 were downregulated. Key enriched biological processes included immune cell apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) overload response, and negative regulation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. Panther analysis revealed the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) cascade, p38 MAPK pathway, p53 pathway, and FAS (a subgroup of the tumor necrosis factor receptor) signaling pathway as highly enriched among dysregulated miRNAs. Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), AR, and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) pathways were identified among the key pathways potentially amenable to targeted therapy. We concluded that a combination approach involving miRNA-based interventions could enhance therapeutic outcomes. Our research emphasizes the importance of precision medicine, targeting pathways using sense and anti-sense miRNAs as potential therapies in GBC.\n",
      "Most sarcomatoid differentiated renal cell carcinoma was differentiated from Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (KICH) and related to a bad prognosis. Thus, finding biomarkers is important for the therapy of KICH.\n",
      "The UCSC was used for determining the expression of mRNA and miRNA and clinical data in KICH and normal samples. KEGG and GO were used for predicting potential function of differently expressed genes (DEGs). Optimal prognostic markers were determined by Lasso regression. Kaplan-Meier survival, ROC, and cox regression were used for assessing prognosis value. GSEA was used for predicting potential function of markers. The relations between markers and immune cell infiltration were determined by Pearson method. The upstream miRNA of markers was predicted in TargetScan and DIANA.\n",
      "The 6162 upregulated and 13,903 downregulated DEGs were identified in KICH. Further CENPE and LDHA were screened out as optimal prognostic risk signatures. CENPE was highly expressed while LDHA was lowly expressed in KICH samples, and the high expressions of 2 genes contributed to bad prognosis. The functions of CENPE and LDHA were mainly enriched in proliferation related pathways such as cell cycle and DNA replication. In addition, the correlation of 2 genes with immune infiltrates in KICH was also observed. Finally, we found that has-miR-577 was the common upstream of 2 genes and the binding sites can be predicted.\n",
      "CENPE and LDHA were identified as the important prognostic biomarkers in KICH, and they might be involved in the proliferation of cancer cell.\n",
      "Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are more prone to develop certain types of cancer. Notably, however, the case statistics can be impacted by late discovery of cancer in individuals afflicted with NDDs, such as intellectual disorders, autism, and schizophrenia, which may bias the numbers. As to NDD-associated mutations, in most cases, they are germline while cancer mutations are sporadic, emerging during life. However, somatic mosaicism can spur NDDs, and cancer-related mutations can be germline. NDDs and cancer share proteins, pathways, and mutations. Here we ask (i) exactly which features they share, and (ii) how, despite their commonalities, they differ in clinical outcomes. To tackle these questions, we employed a statistical framework followed by network analysis. Our thorough exploration of the mutations, reconstructed disease-specific networks, pathways, and transcriptome levels and profiles of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cancers, point to signaling strength as the key factor: strong signaling promotes cell proliferation in cancer, and weaker (moderate) signaling impacts differentiation in ASD. Thus, we suggest that signaling strength, not activating mutations, can decide clinical outcome.\n",
      "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to be crucial in the initiation, progression, and recurrence of cancer. CSCs are also known to be more resistant to cancer treatments. However, the interaction between CSCs and the immune microenvironment is complex and not fully understood. In current study we used single cell RNA sequence (scRNA-Seq, public dataset) technology to identify the characteristic of CSCs. We found that the lung adenocarcinoma cancer stem population is highly inflammatory and remodels the tumor microenvironment by secreting inflammatory factors, specifically the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA). Next, we developed an ex-vivo autologous patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) co-culture model to evaluate the immune biological impact of SAA. We found that SAA not only promotes chemoresistance by inducing cancer stem transformation, but also restricts anti-tumor immunity and promotes tumor fibrosis by driving type 2 immunity, and α-SAA neutralization antibody could restrict treatment resistant and tumor fibrosis. Mechanically, we found that the malignant phenotype induced by SAA is dependent on P2X7 receptor. Our data indicate that cancer stem cells secreted SAA have significant biological impact to promote treatment resistant and tumor fibrosis by driving cancer stemness transformation and type 2 immunity polarization via P2X7 receptor. Notably, α-SAA neutralization antibody shows therapeutic potential by restricting these malignant phenotypes.\n",
      "Due to a lack of time and staff, informed consent (IC) in clinical practice often lacks clarity, comprehensibility and scope of information. Digital media offer great potential to enhance IC.

      "Understanding the mechanisms that enable cancer cells to metastasize is essential in preventing cancer progression. Here we examine the metabolic adaptations of metastasis-initiating cells (MICs) in female breast cancer and how those shape their metastatic phenotype. We find that endogenous MICs depend on the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid usage. Sorting tumor cells based upon solely mitochondrial membrane potential or lipid storage is sufficient at identifying MICs. We further identify that mitochondrially-generated citrate is exported to the cytoplasm to yield acetyl-CoA, and this is crucial to maintaining heightened levels of H3K27ac in MICs. Blocking acetyl-CoA generating pathways or H3K27ac-specific epigenetic writers and readers reduces expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal related genes, MIC frequency, and metastatic potential. Exogenous supplementation of a short chain carboxylic acid, acetate, increases MIC frequency and metastasis. In patient cohorts, we observe that higher expression of oxidative phosphorylation related genes is associated with reduced distant relapse-free survival. These data demonstrate that MICs specifically and precisely alter their metabolism to efficiently colonize distant organs.\n",
      "An early diagnosis and precise prognosis are critical for the treatment of glioma. The mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway potentially affects glioma, but the exploration of the clinical values of the pathway remains lacking. We accessed data from TCGA, GTEx, CGGA, etc. Up-regulated MAPK signaling pathway genes in glioma were identified and used to cluster the glioma subtypes using consensus clustering. The subtype differences in survival, cancer stemness, and the immune microenvironment were analyzed. A prognostic model was trained with the identified genes using the LASSO method and was validated with three external cohorts. The correlations between the risk model and cancer-associated signatures in cancer were analyzed. Key hub genes of the gene set were identified by hub gene analysis and survival analysis. 47% of the MAPK signaling pathway genes were overexpressed in glioma. Subtypes based on these genes were distinguished in survival, cancer stemness, and the immune microenvironment. A risk model was calculated with high confidence in the prediction of overall survival and was correlated with multiple cancer-associated signatures. 12 hub genes were identified and 8 of them were associated with survival. The MAPK signaling pathway was overexpressed in glioma with prognostic value.\n",

      "The efficacy of current surgery and chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is limited due to heterogenous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), which are regarded as an M2 tumor-promoting phenotype, are crucial in the development of the immunosuppressive TME. Targeting TAM reprograming is a promising strategy in anti-tumor therapy since reprogramming techniques provide the opportunity to actively enhance the antitumor immunological activity of TAM in addition to eliminating their tumor-supportive roles, which is rarely applied in TNBC clinically. However, how to drive M2 macrophages reprogramming into M1 with high potency remains a challenge and the molecular mechanisms how M2 macrophages polarized into M1 are poorly understood. Here, we identified a new immunoregulatory molecular PepO that was served as an immunoregulatory molecule governed the transformation of tumor-promoting M2 to tumor-inhibitory M1 cells and represented an effective anti-tumor property.\n",
      "At the present study, we identified a new immunoregulatory molecular PepO, as a harmless immunoregulatory molecule, governed the transformation of tumor-promoting M2 to tumor-inhibitory M1 cells efficiently. PepO-primed M2 macrophages decreased the expression of tumor-supportive molecules like Arg-1, Tgfb, Vegfa and IL-10, and increased the expression of iNOS, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, TNF-α and IL-6 to inhibit TNBC growth. Moreover, PepO enhanced the functions of macrophages related to cell killing, phagocytosis and nitric oxide biosynthetic process, thereby inhibiting the development of tumors in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, PepO reprogramed TAMs toward M1 by activating PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway via TLR4 and suppressed the function of M2 by inhibiting JAK2-STAT3 pathway via TLR2. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the role of PepO in switching M2 macrophages into M1 and in inhibiting TNBC growth in vivo. And PepO failed to govern the M2 macrophages to reprogram into M1 macrophages and inhibit TNBC when TLR2 or TLR4 was deficient. Moreover, PepO enhanced the antitumor activity of doxorubicin and the combination exerted a synergistic effect on TNBC suppression.\n",

Most young women who initiate PrEP in Africa do so through informal peer referral. We wanted to test a model of formalized peer referral enhanced with HIVST delivery among young Kenyan women.\n",
      "The Peer PrEP Trial is a two-arm hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized controlled trial being conducted in central Kenya. Eligible participants (i.e., peer providers, n = 80) are women (≥ 16-24 years) refilling or initiating PrEP at public healthcare clinics who can identify at least four peers who could benefit from PrEP and not enrolled in another HIV study. Peer providers will be 1:1 randomized to (1) formal peer PrEP referral + HIVST delivery, where they will be encouraged to refer four peers (i.e., peer clients, ≥ 16-24 years) using educational materials and HIVST kits (two per peer client), or (2) informal peer PrEP referral, where they are encouraged to refer four peer clients using informal word-of-mouth referral. In both arms, peer providers will deliver a standard PrEP referral card with information on nearby public clinics delivering PrEP services. Peer providers will complete surveys at baseline and 3 months; peer clients will complete surveys at 3 months. Our primary outcome is PrEP initiation among peer clients, as reported by peer providers at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include PrEP continuation (any refilling), HIV testing (past 3 months), sexual behaviors (past month), and PrEP adherence (past month) among peer clients, as reported by both peer providers and clients at 3 months. Implementation outcomes will include participants' perceived acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the intervention as well assessments of the intervention's fidelity and cost.\n",

      "Autophagy is important for the removal, degradation and recycling of damaged organelles, proteins, and lipids through the degradative action of lysosomes. In addition to its catabolic function, autophagy is important in cancer and viral-mediated tumorigenesis, including Human Papillomavirus (HPV) positive cancers. HPV infection is a major risk factor in a subset of head and neck cancer (HNC), for which no targeted therapies are currently available. Herein, we assessed autophagy function in HPV-positive HNC. We showed that HPV-positive HNC cells presented a transcriptional and functional impairment of the autophagic process compared to HPV-negative cells, which were reactivated by knocking down HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins, the drivers of cellular transformation. We found that the oncoprotein c-MYC was stabilized and triggered in HPV-positive cell lines. This resulted in the reduced binding of the MiT/TFE transcription factors to their autophagy targets due to c-MYC competition. Thus, the knock-down of c-MYC induced the upregulation of autophagic and lysosomal genes in HPV-positive HNC cells, as well as the increase of autophagic markers at the protein level. Moreover, HPV oncoprotein E7 upregulated the expression of the phosphatase inhibitor CIP2A, accounting for c-MYC upregulation and stability in HPV+ HNC cells. CIP2A mRNA expression negatively correlated with autophagy gene expression in tumor tissues from HNC patients, showing, for the first time, its implication in a transcriptional autophagic context. Both CIP2A and c-MYC knock-down, as well as pharmacological downregulation of c-MYC, resulted in increased resistance to cisplatin treatment. Our results not only show a novel way by which HPV oncoproteins manipulate the host machinery but also provide more insights into the role of autophagy in chemoresistance, with possible implications for targeted HPV-positive HNC therapy.\n",
      "Prior research has shown that the deconvolution of cell-free RNA can uncover the tissue origin. The conventional deconvolution approaches rely on constructing a reference tissue-specific gene panel, which cannot capture the inherent variation present in actual data. To address this, we have developed a novel method that utilizes a neural network framework to leverage the entire training dataset. Our approach involved training a model that incorporated 15 distinct tissue types. Through one semi-independent and two complete independent validations, including deconvolution using a semi in silico dataset, deconvolution with a custom normal tissue mixture RNA-seq data, and deconvolution of longitudinal circulating tumor cell RNA-seq (ctcRNA) data from a cancer patient with metastatic tumors, we demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of the deep-learning approach which were exerted by effectively capturing the inherent variability present in the dataset, thus leading to enhanced accuracy. Sensitivity analyses reveal that neural network models are less susceptible to the presence of missing data, making them more suitable for real-world applications. Moreover, by leveraging the concept of organotropism, we applied our approach to trace the migration of circulating tumor cell-derived RNA (ctcRNA) in a cancer patient with metastatic tumors, thereby highlighting the potential clinical significance of early detection of cancer metastasis.\n",

The remaining 984 patients had a pathologic fracture secondary to malignancy. The underlying diagnosis reported was corrected in 442 of the 999 patients. The true rate of pathologic hip fractures secondary to malignancy in our material was 0.8%, and most patients had underlying prostate (30%), breast (20%), or lung (17%) cancer.\n",
      "Orthopaedic surgeons in Norway failed to report correct data on pathologic fractures and the corresponding cancer diagnosis in an acute setting in many patients. The corrected data on pathologic fractures in the NHFR from 2005 to 2019 can now be a valid resource for further studies on the subject.\n",
      "Human antigen R (HuR) is a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein, which functions as an RNA regulator. Overexpression of HuR correlates with high grade tumours and poor patient prognosis, implicating it as an attractive therapeutic target. However, an effective small molecule antagonist to HuR for clinical use remains elusive. Here, a single domain antibody (VHH) that binds HuR with low nanomolar affinity was identified and shown to inhibit HuR binding to RNA. This VHH was used to engineer a TRIM21-based biological PROTAC (bioPROTAC) that could degrade endogenous HuR. Significantly, HuR degradation reverses the tumour-promoting properties of cancer cells in vivo by altering the HuR-regulated proteome, highlighting the benefit of HuR degradation and paving the way for the development of HuR-degrading therapeutics. These observations have broader implications for degrading intractable therapeutic targets, with bioPROTACs presenting a unique opportunity to explore targeted-protein degradation through a modular approach.\n",
      "Prostate cancer (PCa), a globally prevalent malignancy, displays intricate heterogeneity within its epithelial cells, closely linked with disease progression and immune modulation. However, the clinical significance of genes and biomarkers associated with these cells remains inadequately explored. To address this gap, this study aimed to comprehensively investigate the roles and clinical value of epithelial cell-related genes in PCa.\n",
      "Leveraging single-cell sequencing data from GSE176031, we conducted an extensive analysis to identify epithelial cell marker genes (ECMGs). Employing consensus clustering analysis, we evaluated the correlations between ECMGs, prognosis, and immune responses in PCa. Subsequently, we developed and validated an optimal prognostic signature, termed the epithelial cell marker gene prognostic signature (ECMGPS), through synergistic analysis from 101 models employing 10 machine learning algorithms across five independent cohorts. Additionally, we collected clinical features and previously published signatures from the literature for comparative analysis. Furthermore, we explored the clinical utility of ECMGPS in immunotherapy and drug selection using multi-omics analysis and the IMvigor cohort. Finally, we investigated the biological functions of the hub gene, transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 3 (TMED3), in PCa using public databases and experiments.\n",
      "We identified a comprehensive set of 543 ECMGs and established a strong correlation between ECMGs and both the prognostic evaluation and immune classification in PCa. Notably, ECMGPS exhibited robust predictive capability, surpassing traditional clinical features and 80 published signatures in terms of both independence and accuracy across five cohorts. Significantly, ECMGPS demonstrated significant promise in identifying potential PCa patients who might benefit from immunotherapy and personalized medicine, thereby moving us nearer to tailored therapeutic approaches for individuals. Moreover, the role of TMED3 in promoting malignant proliferation of PCa cells was validated.\n",
      "Our findings highlight ECMGPS as a powerful tool for improving PCa patient outcomes and supply a robust conceptual framework for in-depth examination of PCa complexities. Simultaneously, our study has the potential to develop a novel alternative for PCa diagnosis and prognostication.\n",
      "Hematogenous tumor spread of malignant meningiomas occurs very rarely but is associated with very poor prognosis.\n",
      "We report an unusual case of a patient with a malignant meningioma who developed multiple metastases in bones, lungs and liver after initial complete resection of the primary tumor. After partial hepatic resection, specimens were histologically analyzed, and a complete loss of E-cadherin adhesion molecules was found. No oncogenic target mutations were found. The patient received a combination of conventional radiotherapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Due to aggressive tumor behavior and rapid spread of metastases, the patient deceased after initiation of treatment.\n",
      "E-cadherin downregulation is associated with a higher probability of tumor invasion and distant metastasis formation in malignant meningioma. Up to now, the efficacy of systemic therapy, including PRRT, is very limited in malignant meningioma patients.\n",
      "Lymph node (LN) metastasis is one of the predominant metastatic routes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is considered as a leading cause for the unsatisfactory prognosis of patients. Although lymphangiogenesis is well-recognized as a crucial process in mediating LN metastasis, the regulatory mechanism involving lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis in NSCLC remains unclear. In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing to identify a novel circular RNA (circRNA), circTLCD4-RWDD3, which was significantly upregulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from LN metastatic NSCLC and was positively associated with deteriorated OS and DFS of patients with NSCLC from multicenter clinical cohort. Downregulating the expression of EV-packaged circTLCD4-RWDD3 inhibited lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis of NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, circTLCD4-RWDD3 physically interacted with hnRNPA2B1 and mediated the SUMO2 modification at K108 residue of hnRNPA2B1 by upregulating UBC9. Subsequently, circTLCD4-RWDD3-induced SUMOylated hnRNPA2B1 was recognized by the SUMO interaction motif (SIM) of ALIX and activated ALIX to recruit ESCRT-III, thereby facilitating the sorting of circTLCD4-RWDD3 into NSCLC cell-derived EVs. Moreover, EV-packaged circTLCD4-RWDD3 was internalized by lymphatic endothelial cells to activate the transcription of PROX1, resulting in the lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis of NSCLC. Importantly, blocking EV-mediated transmission of circTLCD4-RWDD3 via mutating SIM in ALIX or K108 residue of hnRNPA2B1 inhibited the lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis of NSCLC in vivo. Our findings reveal a precise mechanism underlying SUMOylated hnRNPA2B1-induced EV packaging of circTLCD4-RWDD3 in facilitating LN metastasis of NSCLC, suggesting that EV-packaged circTLCD4-RWDD3 could be a potential therapeutic target against LN metastatic NSCLC.\n",
      "Gene status has become the focus of prognosis prediction. Furthermore, deep learning has frequently been implemented in medical imaging to diagnose, prognosticate, and evaluate treatment responses in patients with cancer. However, few deep learning survival (DLS) models based on mutational genes that are directly associated with patient prognosis in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) have been reported. Additionally, DLS models have not been applied to determine IO-related prognosis based on mutational genes. Herein, we developed a deep learning method to predict the prognosis of patients with lung cancer treated with or without immunotherapy (IO).\n",
      "Samples from 6542 patients from different centers were subjected to genome sequencing. A DLS model based on multi-panels of somatic mutations was trained and validated to predict OS in patients treated without IO and PFS in patients treated with IO.\n",
      "In patients treated without IO, the DLS model (low vs. high DLS) was trained using the training MSK-MET cohort (HR = 0.241 [0.213-0.273], P < 0.001) and tested in the inter-validation MSK-MET cohort (HR = 0.175 [0.148-0.206], P < 0.001). The DLS model was then validated with the OncoSG, MSK-CSC, and TCGA-LUAD cohorts (HR = 0.420 [0.272-0.649], P < 0.001; HR = 0.550 [0.424-0.714], P < 0.001; HR = 0.215 [0.159-0.291], P < 0.001, respectively). Subsequently, it was fine-tuned and retrained in patients treated with IO. The DLS model (low vs. high DLS) could predict PFS and OS in the MIND, MSKCC, and POPLAR/OAK cohorts (P < 0.001, respectively). Compared with tumor-node-metastasis staging, the COX model, tumor mutational burden, and programmed death-ligand 1 expression, the DLS model had the highest C-index in patients treated with or without IO.\n",
      "The DLS model based on mutational genes can robustly predict the prognosis of patients with lung cancer treated with or without IO.\n",
      "One of the most common complications in patients with febrile neutropenia, lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma is a bloodstream infection (BSI).\n",
      "This study aimed to evaluate the antibiotic resistance patterns, virulence factors, biofilm-forming strength, and genetic linkage of Escherichia coli strains isolated from bloodstream infections (BSIs) of leukemia patients.\n",
      "The study conducted in Iran from June 2021 to December 2022, isolated 67 E. coli strains from leukemia patients' bloodstream infections in hospitals in two different areas. Several techniques including disk diffusion and broth microdilution were used to identify patterns of antibiotic resistance, microtiter plate assay to measure biofilm formation, and PCR to evaluate the prevalence of different genes such as virulence factors, toxin-antitoxin systems, resistance to β-lactams and fluoroquinolone antibiotics of E. coli strains. Additionally, the genetic linkage of the isolates was analyzed using the Enterobacterial Repeat Intergenic Consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) method.\n",
      "The results showed that higher frequency of BSI caused by E. coli in man than female patients, and patients with acute leukemia had a higher frequency of BSI. Ampicillin and Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid showed the highest resistance, while Imipenem was identified as a suitable antibiotic for treating BSIs by E. coli. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes were present in 22% of the isolates, while 53% of the isolates were ESBL-producing with the blaCTX-M gene as the most frequent β-lactamase gene. The fluoroquinolone resistance genes qnrB and qnrS were present in 50% and 28% of the isolates, respectively. More than 80% of the isolates showed the ability to form biofilms. The traT gene was more frequent than other virulence genes. The toxin-antitoxin system genes (mazF, ccdAB, and relB) showed a comparable frequency. The genetic diversity was detected in E. coli isolates.\n",
      "Our results demonstrate that highly diverse, resistant and pathogenic E. coli clones are circulating among leukemia patients in Iranian hospitals. More attention should be paid to the treatment and management of E. coli bloodstream infections in patients with leukemia.\n",
      "Gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 1 antisense RNA 1 (BBOX1-AS1), located on human chromosome 11 p14, emerges as a critical player in tumorigenesis with diverse oncogenic effects. Aberrant expression of BBOX1-AS1 intricately regulates various cellular processes, including cell growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion, metastasis, cell death, and stemness. Notably, the expression of BBOX1-AS1 was significantly correlated with clinical-pathological characteristics and tumor prognoses, and it could also be used for the diagnosis of lung and esophageal cancers. Through its involvement in the ceRNA network, BBOX1-AS1 competitively binds to eight miRNAs in ten different cancer types. Additionally, BBOX1-AS1 can directly modulate downstream protein-coding genes or act as an mRNA stabilizer. The implications of BBOX1-AS1 extend to critical signaling pathways, including Hedgehog, Wnt/β-catenin, and MELK/FAK pathways. Moreover, it influences drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study provides a systematic review of the clinical significance of BBOX1-AS1's aberrant expression in diverse tumor types. It sheds light on the intricate molecular mechanisms through which BBOX1-AS1 influences cancer initiation and progression and outlines potential avenues for future research in this field.\n",
      "Most of the breast cancers are estrogen receptor-positive recurring with a steady rate of up to 20 years dysregulating the normal cell cycle. Dinaciclib is still in clinical trials and considered as a research drug against such cancers targeting CDK2.The major goal of this study was to identify the potential inhibitors of CDK-2 present in Moringa oleifera for treating hormonal receptor positive breast cancers. For this purpose, in silico techniques; molecular docking, MM-GBSA and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to screen Moringa oleifera compounds and their anticancer potential was determined against CDK-2 protein targets. Among 36 compounds of Moringa oleifera reported in literature, chlorogenic acid (1), quercetin (2), ellagic acid (3), niazirin (4), and kaempferol (5) showed good affinity with the target. The interaction of the compounds was visualized using PYMOL software. The profiles of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) and toxicity were determined using SWISS and ProTox II webservers. The MTT assay was performed in-vitro using MCF-7 cancer cell lines to validate the anticancer potential of Moringa oleifera leaf extract.MTT assay results revealed no significant change in proliferation of Mcf-7 cells following 24 h treatment with fraction A (petroleum ether). However, significant antiproliferative effect was observed at 200 µg/mL dose of fraction B (ethyl acetate) and cell viability was reduced to 40%.In conclusion, the data suggested that all the compounds with highest negative docking score than the reference could be the potential candidates for cyclin dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) inhibition while ellagic acid, chlorogenic acid and quercetin being the most stable and potent inhibitors to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancer targeting CDK-2. Moreover, the data suggested that further investigation is required to determine the optimum dose for significant antiproliferative effects using in-vivo models to validate our findings of in-silico analysis.\n",
      "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine-metabolic disorder affecting health and quality of life of those affected across the lifespan. We currently have limited evidence-based data on the experience of those living with PCOS in the health care system including diagnosis, health concerns and disease management. The aim of this study was to assess the perceptions of health status, health care experience and disease management support in those affected by PCOS in Alberta, Canada.\n",
      "An online questionnaire was completed via REDCap by individuals self-reporting a diagnosis of PCOS. Question categories included demographics, symptoms of PCOS and time to confirm a diagnosis, follow-up care, health concerns, and information resources. Descriptive statistics were used and thematic analyses was applied to open-response questions.\n",
      "Responses from 194 participants living in Canada (93% in Alberta) were included. The average age was 34 ± 8 years and BMI was 35 ± 9. Menstrual irregularity was identified in 84% of respondents as the first symptom noticed and the primary reason for seeking a medical consultation. A PCOS diagnosis occurred on average 4.3 years following awareness of first symptoms and required consultation with more than one primary care provider for 57% of respondents. Half (53%) of respondents reported not receiving a referral to specialists for follow-up care and 70% were not informed about long-term health morbidity such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Most respondents (82%) did their own research about PCOS using on-line sources, academic literature and advice from peer support. The participant themes from open questions for improving health care included more resources and support, increased and reliable information, better education and training for clinicians, timely diagnosis, prompt referrals to specialists, and generally more compassion and empathy to the challenges faced by those managing their disease.\n",
      "Our findings highlight the health concerns and challenges in health care for those with PCOS. In Alberta, Canada we have identified major gaps in health care including a timely diagnosis, follow up care and supports, and multidisciplinary care. This evidence-based data can be used to inform development of pathways to improve the health care experience in those affected by PCOS.\n",
      "Uterine cancer risk is high in breast cancer survivors. Although breast cancer and uterine cancer share some common epidemiological risk factors, association of metabolic syndrome with incident uterine cancer in breast cancer survivors is under-studied. We evaluated the association of metabolic syndrome conditions with second primary uterine cancer in breast cancer survivors.\n",
      "In this retrospective cohort study, 37,303 breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2020 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, an integrated healthcare system, were included. Data on cancer-related variables, sociodemographic, and clinical variables were extracted from KPSC's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-affiliated cancer registry and electronic health records, as appropriate. Patients were followed from breast cancer diagnosis until 12/31/2021 for incident uterine cancer. Proportional hazards regression was used to report association [HR (95% CI)] between metabolic conditions and uterine cancer.\n",
      "More than half (53.1%) of the breast cancer survivors had 1-2 metabolic conditions; 19.4% had 3 + , while 27. 5% had no metabolic conditions. Median time to follow-up was 5.33 years and 185 (0.5%) patients developed second primary uterine cancer. Obesity was associated with an elevated uterine cancer risk in the adjusted model [HR (95% CI) 1.64 (1.20-2.25)]. Having 1-2 metabolic conditions (versus none) was not associated with increased uterine cancer risk [adjusted HR (95% CI) 1.24 (0.85-1.82)]; however, there was an increased uterine cancer risk with 3 + metabolic conditions [adjusted HR (95% CI) 1.82 (1.16-2.87)].\n",

      "Skin toxicities are very common in patients undergoing cancer treatment and have been found to occur with all types of cancer therapeutic interventions (cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy). Further, skin toxicities can lead to interruption or even discontinuation of anticancer treatment in some patients, translating to suboptimal outcomes. Dermocosmetics (or cosmeceuticals)-defined as skincare solutions incorporating dermatologically active ingredients (beyond vehicle effects) that directly improve symptoms of various skin conditions-are increasingly being used in cancer care to prevent and manage skin toxicities. The active ingredients in these products have a measurable biological action in skin; they typically improve skin integrity (barrier function/hydration and other factors) while relieving skin symptoms. The Association Francophone des Soins Oncologiques de Support (AFSOS) and Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) partnered to select a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals involved in the management of patients with cancer and skin toxicities. The group reviewed existing literature and created a summary of recommendations for managing these toxicities through online meetings and communication. In this publication, the group (1) reviews new skin toxicities seen with oncology drugs and (2) evaluates the role of dermocosmetics in improving patient outcomes and minimizing cancer treatment interruptions. We provide general recommendations for initiation and selection of skin care in all oncology patients as well as recommendations for what factors should be considered when using dermocosmetics in specific types of skin toxicities.\n",

      "Adherence to lung cancer screening (LCS) protocols is critical for achieving mortality reductions. However, adherence rates, particularly for recommended annual screening among patients with low-risk findings, are often sub-optimal. We evaluated annual LCS adherence for patients with low-risk findings participating in a centralized screening program at a tertiary academic center.\n",
      "We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of a centralized lung cancer screening program launched in July 2018. We performed electronic medical review of 337 patients who underwent low-dose CT (LDCT) screening before February 1, 2021 (to ensure ≥ 15 months follow up) and had a low-risk Lung-RADS score of 1 or 2. Captured data included patient characteristics (smoking history, Fagerstrom score, environmental exposures, lung cancer risk score), LDCT imaging dates, and Lung-RADS results. The primary outcome measure was adherence to annual screening. We used multivariable logistic regression models to identify factors associated with adherence.\n",
      "Overall, 337 patients had an initial Lung-RADS result of 1 (n = 189) or 2 (n = 148). Among this cohort, 139 (73.5%) of Lung-RADS 1 and 111 (75.0%) of Lung-RADS 2 patients completed the annual repeat LDCT within 15 months, respectively. The only patient characteristic associated with adherence was having Medicaid coverage; compared to having private insurance, Medicaid patients were less adherent (adjusted OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.15-0.92). No other patient characteristic was associated with adherence.\n",
      "Our centralized screening program achieved a high initial annual adherence rate. Although LCS has first-dollar insurance coverage, other socioeconomic concerns may present barriers to annual screening for Medicaid recipients.\n",
      "Breast cancer stands as the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women, holding a prominent position among the leading causes of cancer-related fatalities on a global scale. Despite significant advances in treatment modalities, approximately 20% of patients experience relapses after the first 5 years of postdiagnosis surveillance. While initial investigations from the 1970s indicated comparable survival rates between breast-conserving surgery (BCS) coupled with radiation therapy and mastectomy, recent research suggests that, within the context of modern systemic and radiation therapy, BCS followed by radiation may offer an improved overall survival benefit. Nevertheless, extended follow-up studies have unveiled a notable increase in the risk of locoregional recurrence associated with breast conserving therapy in contrast to mastectomy. This article introduces a novel hypothesis rooted in the biological phenomenon of homing to elucidate this intriguing clinical observation. We postulate that a breast homing mechanism of reactivated circulating and disseminated tumor cells mediated by chemotaxis involving at least the CXCR4-SDF-1 axis may provide a biological rationale for this clinical phenomenon.\n",
      "This study aimed to explore a novel position of mammography named axilla view in axillary lymph node (ALN) evaluation in breast cancer.\n",
      "Patients were prospectively enrolled and scheduled for mammography before surgery. Investigated imaging patterns included mediolateral oblique (2D-MLO) and axilla view (2D-axilla) of mammography, and axilla view of digital breast tomosynthesis (3D-axilla). The correlation of ALN numbers between imaging and pathology was analyzed. Diagnostic performance was analyzed via AUC.\n",
      "75 patients were included. A larger and clearer axillary region was displayed in axilla view. The total number of ALNs detected under 2D/3D-axilla view was significantly higher than that under 2D-MLO view (4.6 vs. 2.5, P < .001; 5.6 vs. 4.6, P = .034). Correlations between number of positive ALNs detected under 2D/3D-axilla view and pathologically confirmed metastatic ALNs were stronger than 2D-MLO view (Pearson correlation coefficients: 0.7084,0.7044 and 0.4744). The proportion of cases with ≥5 positive ALNs detected under 3D-axilla view was significantly higher than that under 2D-MLO (38.2% vs. 14.7%, P = .028). The overweight and obese group showed a higher AUC value than the underweight and lean group in ALN evaluation, although not significantly (2D-MLO: 0.7643 vs. 0.6458, P = .2656; 2D-axilla: 0.8083 vs. 0.6586, P = .1522; 3D-axilla: 0.8045 vs. 0.6615, P = .1874). This difference was more pronounced in axilla view.\n",

      "Ninety-six patients were included with a total of 1726 PK samples and 1081 ANCs. The POP-PK/PD model described both cabazitaxel PK and ANC accurately. A cabazitaxel plasma concentration of >4.96 ng/ml at 6 h after the start of infusion was found to be predictive of severe neutropenia, with a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 65%.\n",
      "Early cabazitaxel plasma levels are predictive of severe neutropenia. Implementation of the proposed PK threshold results in early identification of almost 76% of all severe neutropenias. If prospectively validated, patients at risk could benefit from prophylactic administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factors, preventing severe neutropenia in an early phase of treatment. Implementation of this threshold permits a less restricted use of the 25 mg/m\n",
      "Treatment with cabazitaxel chemotherapy often causes neutropenia, leading to susceptibility to infections, which might be life threatening. We found that a systemic cabazitaxel concentration above 4.96 ng/ml 6 h after the start of infusion is predictive of the occurrence of severe neutropenia. Measurement of systemic cabazitaxel levels provides clinicians with the opportunity to prophylactically stimulate neutrophil growth.\n",

      "Breast tumours are the most common tumours in women but represent a very heterogeneous group. On the one hand, there are ductal and lobular carcinomas of the breast, representing 90% of tumours, whose clinicopathologic characteristics are well known. On the other hand, there are rare breast tumours, each of which represents less than 1% that limits their study through large cohorts. The objective of this work was to collect, update and synthesize knowledge on these rare tumours. A literature review was performed on the Medline and Google Scholar databases. We present here a selection of several rare tumours, providing updated data at the epidemiological, histopathological, genetic, clinical and radiographic, prognostic and therapeutic levels, taking into account the place of radiotherapy. Each tumour histology is unique and has its own characteristics, the management must therefore be adapted as much as possible and decided in a multidisciplinary meeting.\n",
      "There are a large number of gynaecological cancers with rare histologies, for which the available data are limited and usually retrospective. Because of their rarity and poor prognosis, the management of these cancers must be centralized in expert centres, for both histological diagnosis and treatment. With the exception of sarcomas, most endometrial or cervical cancers with rare histologies respond to the same radiation treatment modalities than cancers with more common histologies, although there are some specificities regarding treatments such as neuroendocrine carcinomas (chemotherapy with platinum and etoposide, major role of surgery). For localized or locally advanced ovarian cancer, external beam radiotherapy has a role in the management of hypercalcaemic small cell carcinoma of the ovary. This article summarizes the current role of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy in the management of cancers of the uterine cervix, uterine corpus and ovaries, with rare or very rare histologies, and with localized or locally advanced stages.\n",

      "A systematic literature search was performed to find relevant studies published in different databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase up until March 10, 2023. All papers were independently evaluated for eligibility by two reviewers. Studies that matched research questions and provided sufficient data for quantitative synthesis were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. The quality of the articles was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) tools. The predictive value of MRI-based radiomics for Ki-67 antigen in patients with breast cancer was assessed using pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity, and area under the curve (AUC).

The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of MRI-based radiomics for predicting Ki-67 expression in training cohorts were 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73-0.86], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.78-0.86], and 0.88 [95%CI, 0.85-0.91], respectively. The corresponding values for validation cohorts were 0.81 [95% CI, 0.72-0.87], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.62-0.82], and 0.84 [95%CI, 0.80-0.87], respectively. Based on QUADAS-2, some risks of bias were detected for reference standard and flow and timing domains. However, the quality of the included article was acceptable. The mean RQS score of the included articles was close to 6, corresponding to 16.6% of the maximum possible score. Significant heterogeneity was observed in pooled sensitivity and specificity of training cohorts (I\n",
      "This meta-analysis showed that MRI-based radiomics has a good diagnostic accuracy in differentiating breast cancer patients with high Ki-67 expression from low-expressing groups. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these methods still do not surpass 90%, restricting them from being used as a supplement to current pathological assessments (e.g., biopsy or surgery) to predict Ki-67 expression accurately.\n",
      "Platform trials are adaptive randomised controlled trials that address multiple questions using a single protocol, which reduces the time taken to reach a meaningful trial endpoint. This mini review provides a description of how to conceive, design, and carry out a platform trial in urology, using experience gained in the STAMPEDE trial. PATIENT SUMMARY: Clinical trials to test how well a new drug or treatment works can take a long time before meaningful results can be assessed. Trials with a platform design can test multiple treatments using just one protocol and control, which reduces the time taken to reach a trial endpoint.\n",
      "Redox imbalance is defined by disruption in oxidative and reductive pathways and has a central role in cancer initiation, development, and treatment. Although redox imbalance has traditionally been characterized by high levels of oxidative stress, emerging evidence suggests that an overly reductive environment is just as detrimental to cancer proliferation. Reductive stress is defined by heightened levels of antioxidants, including glutathione and elevated NADH, compared with oxidized NAD, which disrupts central biochemical pathways required for proliferation. With the advent of new technologies that measure and manipulate reductive stress, the sensors and drivers of this overlooked metabolic stress are beginning to be revealed. In certain genetically defined cancers, targeting reductive stress pathways may be an effective strategy. Redox-based pathways are gaining recognition as essential 'regulatory hubs,' and a broader understanding of reductive stress signaling promises not only to reveal new insights into metabolic homeostasis but also potentially to transform therapeutic options in cancer.\n",
      "This study aimed to compare the dose distributions and clarify the dosimetric characteristics of spot-scanning proton therapy (SSPT) and photon volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for extrahepatic bile duct cancer (EBDC). This retrospective study included 10 patients with EBDC treated with real-time image-gated SSPT. Using the simultaneous integrated boost technique, the 2 prescription dose levels for planning target volumes were 72.6 and 44 Gy, delivered in 22 fractions. Plan quality comparisons were conducted by analyzing various parameters, including homogeneity, conformity, dose to organs at risk, and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for radiation-induced liver damage (RILD). The target dose distributions using SSPT were almost equivalent to those achieved using photon VMAT. There was a significant reduction in all liver dose parameters, the NTCP value for RILD, and kidney dose (mean, V\n",
      "A beam angle optimization (BAO) algorithm was developed to evaluate its clinical feasibility and investigate the impact of varying BAO constraints on breast cancer treatment plans.\n",
      "A two-part study was designed. In part 1, we retrospectively selected 20 patients treated with radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. For each patient, BAO plans were designed using beam angles optimized by the BAO algorithm and the same optimization constraints as manual plans. Dosimetric indices were compared between BAO and manual plans. In part 2, fifteen patients with left breast cancer were included. For each patient, three distinct cardiac constraints (mean heart dose < 5 Gy, 3 Gy or 1 Gy) were established during the BAO process to obtain three optimized beam sets which were marked as BAO_H1, BAO_H3, BAO_H5, respectively. These sets of beams were then utilized under identical IMRT constraints for planning. Comparative analysis was conducted among the three groups of plans.\n",
      "For part 1, no significant differences were observed between BAO plans and manual plans in all dosimetric indices, except for ipsilateral lung V5, where BAO plans performed slightly better than manual plans (35.5% ± 5.6% vs 36.9% ± 4.3%, p = 0.034). For part 2, Stricter BAO heart constraints resulted in more perpendicular beams. However, there was no significant difference between BAO_H1, BAO_H3 and BAO_H5 with the same IMRT constraint in the heart dose. Meanwhile, the left lung dose was increased while the right breast and lung doses were decreased with stricter heart constraints in BAO. When mean heart dose < 5 Gy in IMRT constraint, the mean dose to the right lung was decreased from 0.46 Gy for BAO_H5 to 0.33 Gy for BAO_H1 (p = 0.027).\n",
      "The BAO algorithm can achieve quality plans comparable to manual plans. IMRT constraints dominate the final plan dose, while varying BAO constraints alter the trade-off among structures, providing an additional degree of freedom in planning design.\n",

      "A propensity score-matching comparison of robotic and open pancreaticoduodenectomy based on seven factors commonly used to predict the survival outcomes in ampullary cancer patients.\n",
      "A total of 147 patients were enrolled, of which 101 and 46 underwent robotic and open pancreaticoduodenectomies, respectively. After propensity score-matching with a 2:1 ratio, 88 and 44 patients in the robotic and open pancreaticoduodenectomy groups were included. The operation time was of no significant difference after matching. The median intraoperative blood loss was much less in those who underwent robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy, both before (median, 120 vs. 320 c.c. P < 0.001) and after (100 vs. 335 mL P < 0.001) score-matching. There were no significant differences in terms of surgical risks, including surgical mortality, surgical morbidity, Clavien-Dindo severity classification, postoperative pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage, chyle leak, bile leak, and wound infection, both before or after score-matching. The survival outcomes were also similar between the two groups, regardless of matching.\n",

      "Diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) plays an important role in the management and follow-up of children presenting with urinary tract infection. This study compared voiding uronosography (VUS) as a diagnostic method for the diagnosis of VUR with the \"gold standard\", voiding or micturating cystourethrography (MCU). The objective of the study is not only to compare the effectiveness of both methods, but also to assess the feasibility of implementing VUS technically and economically in a large tertiary radiology center in South America.\n",
      "This was a prospective accuracy study that include 41 patients (a total of 85 ureteral units) aged between 1 month and 16 years. VUS was performed in an alternative form as regular MCU, by injecting microbubble contrast solution (SonoVue©) into the bladder through an intermittent catheter and evaluating the presence of reflux with ultrasound. MCU was always performed immediately after VUS. One pediatric radiologist evaluated all VUS exams, while a second independent pediatric radiologist evaluated all MCU exams, with both blinded to each other's assessments.\n",
      "Comparing VUS with MCU in the diagnosis of VUR, we observed a sensitivity of 92.3 % (95 % CI 74.9-99.1 %), specificity of 98.3 % (95 % CI 90.9-100 %), positive predictive value of 96.0 % (95 % CI 79.6-99.9 %), negative predictive value of 96.7 % (95 % CI 88.5-99.6 %) and a Kappa of 0.916 (0.822-1.000). When comparing the VUR grading between VUS and MCU the agreement between the two methods was high with a Kendall's Tau-b > 0.9. VUS failed to diagnose two grade 1 VUR reflux cases in teenagers while diagnosing one grade 4 VUR in a very dilated kidney-ureter unit, which was missed on MCU. VUS and MCU had similar costs when considering the price of the ultrasound contrast agent.\n",
      "VUS is a reliable alternative method to MCU for the diagnosis of VUR with the advantages of not exposing the child to ionizing radiation and potentially being more accessible due to the greater availability of ultrasound equipment. Limitations to this study include the usage of a single ultrasound equipment, which limits its generalizability and not evaluating the interobserver variability.\n",
      "Consideration should be given to implementing VUS for the diagnosis of VUR, particularly in centers without fluoroscopy equipment available, since the exam's performance and cost are comparable to those of the MCU.\n",
      "Machine learning has been increasingly used to develop algorithms that can improve medical diagnostics and prognostication and has shown promise in improving the classification of thyroid ultrasound images. This proof-of-concept study aims to develop a multimodal machine-learning model to classify follicular carcinoma from adenoma.\n",
      "This is a retrospective study of patients with follicular adenoma or carcinoma at a single institution between 2010 and 2022. Demographics, imaging, and perioperative variables were collected. The region of interest was annotated on ultrasound and used to perform radiomics analysis. Imaging features and clinical variables were then used to create a random forest classifier to predict malignancy. Leave-one-out cross-validation was conducted to evaluate classifier performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\n",
      "Patients with follicular adenomas (n = 7) and carcinomas (n = 11) with complete imaging and perioperative data were included. A total of 910 features were extracted from each image. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding method reduced the dimension to 2 primary represented components. The random forest classifier achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (clinical only), 0.29 (image only), and 0.79 (multimodal data).\n",
      "Our multimodal machine learning model demonstrates promising results in classifying follicular carcinoma from adenoma. This approach can potentially be applied in future studies to generate models for preoperative differentiation of follicular thyroid neoplasms.\n",
      "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is an uncommon high-grade primary epithelial ovarian cancer, covering about 10-12 % of all ovarian malignancies. It has a strong association with endometriosis. OCCC diagnosis, at advanced stages, has an aggressive biological behaviour, and the therapeutic strategies for ovarian OCCC are somehow different from other ovarian carcinomas. Therefore, early diagnosis of these tumours is of extreme importance. As some ovarian tumours subtypes have distinguishing features, it is possible to differentiate them based on their imaging characteristics, which can guide patient management and help the clinicians and pathologists in their diagnosis. A large mass on one side of the ovary that is mostly cystic, with a focal or multifocal irregular eccentric growing solid mural nodules or projections protruding into the cystic space, may suggest clear cell carcinoma of the ovary diagnosis. The solid nodules usually have an intermediate signal on T2-weighted images. The cystic component can be either single or multilocular, and the contents may contain protein or blood. CT scanning is still the preferred method for preoperative staging and postoperative restaging, and radiologists are crucial in identifying this type of tumour. We reviewed the imaging files of patients with surgically proven clear cell carcinoma at the specimens, and our findings agree with previous studies. This paper aims to perform a comprehensive revision of OCCC's radiological and clinic-pathological features and assist radiologists in recognizing OCCC and narrowing down the possibilities of differential diagnosis.\n",
      "Digital Pathology (DP) has experienced a significant growth in recent years and has become an essential tool for diagnosing and prognosis of tumors. The availability of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and the implementation of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have paved the way for the appearance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that support the diagnosis process. These systems require extensive and varied data for their training to be successful. However, creating labeled datasets in histopathology is laborious and time-consuming. We have developed a crowdsourcing-multiple instance labeling/learning protocol that is applied to the creation and use of the CR-AI4SkIN dataset.\n",
      "Drug combination therapy is a main pillar of cancer therapy. As the number of possible drug candidates for combinations grows, the development of optimal high complexity combination therapies (involving 4 or more drugs per treatment) such as RCHOP-I and FOLFIRINOX becomes increasingly challenging due to combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we propose a text mining (TM) based tool and workflow for rapid generation of high complexity combination treatments (HCCT) in order to extend the boundaries of complexity in cancer treatments. Our primary objectives were: (1) Characterize the existing limitations in combination therapy; (2) Develop and introduce the Plan Builder (PB) to utilize existing literature for drug combination effectively; (3) Evaluate PB's potential in accelerating the development of HCCT plans. Our results demonstrate that researchers and experts using PB are able to create HCCT plans at much greater speed and quality compared to conventional methods. By releasing PB, we hope to enable more researchers to engage with HCCT planning and demonstrate its clinical efficacy.\n",
      "Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and ventricular fibrillation (VFIB) are two common cardiovascular diseases that cause numerous deaths worldwide. Medical staff usually adopt long-term ECGs as a tool to diagnose AFIB and VFIB. However, since ECG changes are occasionally subtle and similar, visual observation of ECG changes is challenging. To address this issue, we proposed a multi-angle dual-channel fusion network (MDF-Net) to automatically recognize AFIB and VFIB heartbeats in this work. MDF-Net can be seen as the fusion of a task-related component analysis (TRCA)-principal component analysis (PCA) network (TRPC-Net), a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-PCA network (CPC-Net), and the linear support vector machine-weighted softmax with average (LS-WSA) method. TRPC-Net and CPC-Net are employed to extract deep task-related and correlation features, respectively, from two-lead ECGs, by which multi-angle feature-level information fusion is realized. Since the convolution kernels of the above methods can be directly extracted through TRCA, CCA and PCA technologies, their training time is faster than that of convolutional neural networks. Finally, LS-WSA is employed to fuse the above features at the decision level, by which the classification results are obtained. In distinguishing AFIB and VFIB heartbeats, the proposed method achieved accuracies of 99.39 % and 97.17 % in intra- and inter-patient experiments, respectively. In addition, this method performed well on noisy data and extremely imbalanced data, in which abnormal heatbeats are much less than normal heartbeats. Our proposed method has the potential to be used as a diagnostic tool in the clinic.\n",
      "Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are the sixth most common malignant tumors worldwide. Tongue squamous cell carcinoma is a common malignant tumor of this type, and it is associated with poor prognosis, a high rate of recurrence and a low survival rate. Plumbagin is derived from Plumbago zeylanica L, several studies report that plumbagin could inhibit cell, tumor metastasis, induce apoptosis in various cancer cells. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model can maintain the heterogeneity and microenvironment of human tumors, is a powerful research tool for developing potentially effective therapies for TSCC.\n",
      "Tumor tissues obtained from TSCC patients were implanted into immunodeficient mice to establish TSCC PDX models. Subsequently, the PDX models were used to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of plumbagin on TSCC. Furthermore, we conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and explored the mRNA expression profiles between the treatment and control groups. We selected eight mRNAs related to the characteristics and prognosis of TSCC patients for further analysis.\n",
      "Plumbagin could inhibit the growth of TSCC PDX models and inhibit expression of Akt/mTOR pathway. In addition, plumbagin was shown to increase drug sensitivity to cisplatin. The eight mRNAs selected for further analysis, AXL, SCG5, VOPP1, DCBLD2 and DRAM1 are cancer-promoting genes, DUSP1, AQP5 and BLNK are cancer suppressor genes. And they were related to the diagnosis, growth, prognosis, and immune cell infiltration in TSCC patients.\n",

      "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant global health concern as it ranks as the sixth most common malignant tumor and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In this study, we analyzed the expression of centromere protein B (CENPB) mRNA in HCC using TCGA and GEO datasets. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to determine CENPB protein levels in 490 HCC patients. Our findings revealed higher expression of CENPB mRNA in HCC tissues across the three datasets. Additionally, as the pathological stage and histological grade advanced, CENPB expression increased. Patients with elevated levels of CENPB mRNA and protein demonstrated shorter overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (OS). Notably, CENPB protein showed prognostic value in patients with stage I/II, AFP levels below 400 ng/ml, and tumor size less than 5 cm. Using multivariate regression analysis in 490 HCC patients, we developed nomograms to predict 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS and RFS. Knockdown of CENPB in Hep3B and MHCC97 cell lines resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis identified miR-29a as a potential negative regulator of CENPB expression, which was validated through a dual-luciferase reporter assay. In conclusion, our findings suggest that CENPB may serve as an oncogenic factor in HCC and is directly regulated by miR-29a, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic target.\n",
      "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main pathological type of lung cancer. In this study, multi-omics analysis revealed a significant increase of pseudouridine synthase 1 (PUS1) in NSCLC and the high expression of PUS1 was associated with shorter OS (Overall Survival), PFS (Progression Free Survival), and PPS (Post Progression Survival) of NSCLC patients. Clinical subgroup analysis showed that PUS1 may be involved in the occurrence and development of NSCLC. Besides, TIMER, ESTIMATE, and IPS analysis suggested that PUS1 expression was associated with immune cell infiltration, and the expression of PUS1 was significantly negatively correlated with DC cell infiltration. GESA analysis also indicated PUS1 may involve in DNA_REPAIR, E2F_TARGETS, MYC_TARGETS_V2, G2M_CHECKPOINT and MYC_TARGETS_V1 pathways and triggered NSCLC malignancy through MCM5 or XPO1. Furthermore, PUS1 may be a potential target for NSCLC therapy.\n",

      "Cholera is a waterborne disease caused by Vibrio cholerae bacteria generally transmitted through contaminated food or water sources. Although it has been eradicated in most Western countries, cholera continues to be a highly transmitted and lethal disease in several African and Southeast Asian countries. Unfortunately, current diagnostic methods for cholera have challenges including high cost or delayed diagnoses that can lead to increased disease transmission during pandemics, while current treatments such as therapeutic drugs and vaccines have limited efficacy against drug-resistant serogroups of Vibrio cholerae. As such, new solutions that can treat cholera in an efficient manner that avoids Vibrio cholerae's adaptive immunity are needed. Nanoparticles (NPs) are a suitable platform for enhancing current theranostic tools because of their biocompatibility and ability to improve drug circulation and targeting. Nanoparticle surfaces can also be modified with various protein receptors targeting cholera toxins produced by Vibrio cholerae. This review will address recent developments in diagnostics, therapeutics, and prevention against cholera particularly focusing on the use of metal-based nanoparticles and organic nanoparticles. We will then discuss future directions regarding nanoparticle research for cholera.\n",
      "As a population of homogeneous cells with both self-renewal and differentiation potential, stem cell pools are highly compartmentalized and contain distinct subsets that exhibit stable but limited heterogeneity during homeostasis. However, their striking plasticity is showcased under natural or artificial stress, such as injury, transplantation, cancer, and aging, leading to changes in their phenotype, constitution, metabolism, and function. The complex and diverse network of cell-extrinsic niches and signaling pathways, together with cell-intrinsic genetic and epigenetic regulators, tightly regulate both the heterogeneity during homeostasis and the plasticity under perturbation. Manipulating these factors offers better control of stem cell behavior and a potential revolution in the current state of regenerative medicine. However, disruptions of normal regulation by genetic mutation or excessive plasticity acquisition may contribute to the formation of tumors. By harnessing innovative techniques that enhance our understanding of stem cell heterogeneity and employing novel approaches to maximize the utilization of stem cell plasticity, stem cell therapy holds immense promise for revolutionizing the future of medicine.\n",

      "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world. MiRNA-22 has emerged as a potential candidate with diagnostic significance; however, its expression profile across the normal-adenoma-carcinoma transition in colorectal remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluated serum miRNA-22 levels in patients with varying stages of CRC. The study cohort comprised 49 healthy controls, 50 patients with polyps, 51 individuals with colorectal adenoma (CRA), and 50 cases of CRC, confirmed through proctocolonoscopy and pathological biopsy. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed to validate the significantly differential expression of serum miRNA-22 among different stages of CRC progression. The 2-ΔΔCT method was utilized to assess the relative changes in serum miRNA-22 expression levels. Our results revealed no significant differences in gender, adenoma grade, location, or TNM classification stage in terms of serum miR-22 expression across the four groups. Notably, both the CRC and CRA groups exhibited higher miR-22 expression levels compared to the control group (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0004), with the CRA and CRC groups displaying higher expression levels than the polyp group (p = 0.02, p = 0.043). Ordered multicategorical logistic regression analysis model revealed the utilization of age, gender, smoking status, and miR-22 expression collectively exhibited the highest value for the area under the curve (AUC=0.748) in the discrimination between individuals CRC and healthy. The independent factor of expression of miR-22 demonstrated the most notable predictive capacity (AUC=0.753) when distinguishing between CRA and healthy individuals. Furthermore, the independent expression of miR-22 exhibited discernible potential (AUC=0.654, 0.636) differentiation between polyps and CRA/ CRC. Notably, the factor of age displayed the most substantial discriminatory power (AUC=0.741) when distinguishing between polyps and healthy individuals. Our findings provide supportive evidence for considering miR-22 as a potential biomarker for CRC early screening. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms of miR-22 regulation in colorectal lesions still need to be investigated.\n",
      "Cathepsin C (CTSC) has been reported to be upregulated in several cancers, however, there are still many missing links about the role of CTSC in glioma. To address this knowledge gap, the present study employed bioinformatics analysis, Transwell assay, RT-qPCR and Western blot assays to investigate the expression level of CTSC in glioma tissues, its relationship with survival period, and its effect on the migration and invasion ability of glioma cells. The findings revealed that CTSC was upregulated in glioma and was associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, CTSC was found to promote cell migration and invasion abilities as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A further study found that CTSC induced SERPINA3 and STAT3 expression in glioma cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that STAT3 signaling mediated upregulation of SERPINA3 expression by CTSC. In sum, our findings suggest that CTSC activates the STAT3/SERPINA3 axis to promote migration and invasion of glioma cells, which may lead to new potential therapeutic approaches for humans with cancer.\n",

In the majority, the level of evidence supporting the recommendations and statements was moderate or expert opinion, only, indicating that spine SBRT is still an evolving field of clinical research. Recommendations were established concerning the selection of appropriate patients with painful spine metastases and oligometastatic disease. Recommendations about the practice of spinal SBRT covered technical planning aspects including dose and fractionation, patient positioning, immobilization and image-guided SBRT delivery. Finally, recommendations were developed regarding quality assurance protocols, including description of potential SBRT-related toxicity and risk mitigation strategies.\n",

We used the 4T1 murine TNBC model (primary and secondary tumors) to investigate the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade, local RT, anti-GITR agonist, and their combinations. We assessed tumor growth by tumor volume measurements, in vivo bioluminescence imaging, and metastatic lung nodule counts to evaluate the effects of these treatments. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry determined the proportions and phenotypes of CD8\n",
      "In the METABRIC cohort, patients with high expression of TNFRSF18, which encodes GITR, had significantly better survival than those with low expression. Adding local RT or anti-GITR agonist to PD-L1 blockade did not significantly augment efficacy compared to PD-L1 blockade alone; however, adding both to PD-L1 blockade significantly reduced tumor growth and lung metastasis. The benefits of triple combination were accompanied by increased CD8\n",

Regular follow-up visits with objective and subjective evaluation of treatment tolerance were performed after 0 and 2 weeks, 6 months and at annual intervals.\n",
      "Between 02/2017-01/2020, 175 patients with breast conserving surgery met the inclusion criteria for APBI. Mean age was 65.7 years (range 46-88). 13% of patients were diagnosed with DCIS/Tis, 5/35/37% with T1a/b/c, and 10% with T2 stages, respectively. The mean volume of PTV was 119 cc (range 45-465), the ratio of mean PTV: whole breast volume ratio was 21% (7-53%). Mean follow-up was 42 months (median 45, range 0 - 67). Acute toxicity after 2 weeks was low with 69/26/5% grade 0/1/2. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-year follow-up data was available from 146/134/107/73/25 patients. Patient-reported cosmetic outcomes were assessed excellent or good in 97.9/98.5/98.1/98.6/100%. Regarding grade 2 toxicities, as by now 3/2/2/0/0% G2 fibrosis, 1/1/0/0/0% G2 atrophy, no G2 skin telangiectasia or breast edema occurred. So far, none of the patients have experienced G3 toxicity or higher. The remaining patients had grade 0 or 1 toxicity only. Five ipsilateral breast recurrences (one marginally to PTV, four out-of-field) and five distant recurrences were recorded by now (03/2023). The 4-year in-breast recurrence rate was 2.5%. Eight patients died, two of them from disease. For all patients, the 4-year overall, cancer specific and disease-free survival rates were 97.1%, 99.4%, and 95.3%, respectively.\n",

      "Dedifferentiated and undifferentiated ovarian carcinomas (DDOC/UDOC) are rare neoplasms defined by the presence of an undifferentiated carcinoma. In this study, we detailed the clinical, pathological, immunohistochemical and molecular features of a series of DDOC/UDOC. We collected a multi-institutional cohort of 23 DDOC/UDOC and performed immunohistochemistry for core SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex proteins (ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4 and SMARCB1), mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and p53. Array-based genome-wide DNA methylation and copy number variation (CNV) analyses were performed on a subset of cases with comparison made to a previously reported cohort of undifferentiated endometrial carcinoma (UDEC), small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), and tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). The 23 patients with DDOC/UDOC ranged in age from 22 to 71 years old (average 50) and the majority presented with extra-ovarian disease (16/23). Clinical follow-up was available for 19 patients. Except for two patients, all remaining 17 patients died from disease, with rapid disease progression resulting in mortality within a year in stage II-IV settings (median disease specific survival of 3 months). Eighteen of 22 cases with interpretable immunohistochemistry results showed loss of expression of core SWI/SNF protein(s) that are expected to result in SWI/SNF complex inactivation as 10 exhibited co-loss of ARID1A and ARID1B, 7 loss of SMARCA4 and 1 loss of SMARCB1. Six of 23 cases were MMR-deficient. Two of 20 cases exhibited mutation-type p53 immunoreactivity. Methylation profiles showed co-clustering of DDOC/UDOC with UDEC which collectively were distinct from SCCOHT and HGSC. DDOC/UDOC showed an intermediate degree of CNV, which was slightly greater compared to SCCOHT but much less compared to HGSC. Overall, DDOC/UDOC, like its endometrial counterpart, is a highly aggressive and is characterized by frequent inactivation of core SWI/SNF complex proteins and MMR deficiency. Its molecular profile overlaps with UDEC while being distinct from SCCOHT and HGSC.\n",
      "CDH1 encodes for E-cadherin, and its loss of function is the hallmark of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Albeit vanishingly rare, bi-allelic CDH1 alterations may be found in non-lobular breast carcinomas (NL-BCs). We sought to determine the clinicopathologic characteristics and repertoire of genetic alterations of NL-BCs harboring CDH1 bi-allelic genetic alterations. Analysis of 5,842 breast cancers (BCs) subjected to clinical tumor-normal sequencing with an FDA-cleared multi-gene panel was conducted to identify BCs with bi-allelic CDH1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic somatic mutations lacking lobular features. The genomic profiles of NL-BCs with CDH1 bi-allelic genetic alterations were compared to those of ILCs and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs), matched by clinicopathologic characteristics. Out of 896 CDH1-altered BCs, 889 samples were excluded based on diagnosis of invasive mixed ductal/lobular carcinoma or ILC or detection of monoallelic CDH1 alterations. Only 7 of 5,842 (0.11%) BCs harbored bi-allelic CDH1 alterations and lacked lobular features. Of these, 4/7 (57%) cases were ER-positive/HER2-negative, 1/7 (14%) was ER-positive/HER2-positive and 2/7 (29%) were ER-negative/HER2-negative. 5/7 (71%) were of Nottingham grade 2 and 2/7 (29%) were of grade 3. The NL-BCs with CDH1 bi-allelic genetic alterations included a mucinous carcinoma (n=1), IDCs with focal nested growth (n=2), IDC with solid papillary (n=1) or apocrine (n=2) features and an IDC of no special type (NST; n=1). E-cadherin expression as detected by immunohistochemistry was absent (3/5) or aberrant (discontinuous membranous/cytoplasmic/granular; 2/5). NL-BCs with CDH1 bi-allelic genetic alterations displayed recurrent genetic alterations including TP53, PIK3CA (57%, 4/7; each), FGFR1 and NCOR1 (28%, 2/7, each) alterations. As compared to CDH1-wildtype IDC-NSTs, NL-BCs less frequently harbored GATA3 mutations (0% vs 47%, p=0.03) but no significant differences were detected when compared to matched ILCs. NL-BCs with CDH1 bi-allelic genetic alterations are vanishingly rare, predominantly comprise IDCs with special histologic features, and have genomic features akin to luminal B ER-positive BCs.\n",
      "To investigate the natural history of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis progression.\n",
      "This single-institution retrospective cohort study analyzed patients diagnosed with internal carotid artery stenosis of 50% or greater on duplex ultrasound (DUS) from 2015-2022. Subjects were drawn from our institutional IAC-accredited noninterventional vascular laboratory database. Primary outcomes were incidences of disease progression, and stroke or revascularization after index study. Progression was defined as an increase in stenosis classification category. Imaging, demographic, and clinical data was obtained from our institutional EMR via a database mining query. Cases were analyzed at the patient and artery levels, with severity corresponding to the greatest degree of ICA stenosis on index and follow-up studies.\n",
      "Of 577 arteries in 467 patients, mean cohort age was 73.5±8.9 years at the time of the index study and 45.0% (n=210) were female. Patients were followed with DUS for a mean of 42.2±22.7 months. Of 577 arteries, 65.5% (n=378) at the index imaging study had moderate (50-69%) stenosis, 23.7% (n=137) had severe (70-99%) stenosis, and 10.7% (n=62) were occluded. These three groups had significant differences in age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia prevalence, and proportion on best medical therapy. Of the 467 patient cohort, 56.5% (n=264) were on best medical therapy, defined as smoking cessation, treatment with an antiplatelet agent, statin, and antihypertensive and glycemic agents as indicated. Mean time to progression for affected arteries was 28.0±20.5 months. Of those arteries with nonocclusive disease at diagnosis, 21.3% (n=123) progressed in their level of stenosis. Older age, diabetes, and a history of vasculitis were associated with stenosis progression, while antiplatelet agent use trended towards decreased progression rates. Of the 467 patients, 5.6% (n=26) developed symptoms; of those, 38.5% (n=10) had ischemic strokes, 26.9% (n=7) had hemispheric transient ischemic attacks, 11.5% (n=3) had amaurosis fugax, and 23.1% (n=6) had other symptoms. A history of head and neck cancer was positively associated with symptom development. Of 577 affected arteries, 16.6% (n=96) underwent intervention; 81% (n=78) of interventions were for asymptomatic disease and 19% (n=18) were for symptomatic disease. No patient level factors were associated with risk of intervention.\n",
      "A significant number of carotid stenosis patients experience progression of disease. Physicians should consider long term surveillance on all patients with carotid disease, with increased attention paid to those with risk factors for progression, particularly those with diabetes and a history of vasculitis.\n",
      "In recent years, the incidence of thyroid cancer has been on a significant rise worldwide, and a number of environmental factors have been suspected to be risk factors for thyroid cancer, especially the relationship between iodine intake and thyroid cancer has attracted attention. In this study, we want to assess the relationship between different water iodine exposures and thyroid cancer incidence before and after water alteration in areas with high water iodine in China. Thyroid cancer patients (2009-2020) were enrolled at two hospitals, both in Heze City, Shandong Province, an area with high water iodine levels. According to the criteria of the study, 5826 cases out of 8785 cases were selected for inclusion in the study. Before and after water alteration, the incidence of thyroid cancer was highest in areas with water iodine concentrations of 200-300 μg/L in high iodine areas. In areas where water iodine decreased to adequate iodine levels, there was a strong negative correlation between the decreased level of water iodine and the incidence of thyroid cancer. In addition, in cases with pathology reports, we found that the greater the decrease in water iodine values, the markedly smaller the maximum diameter of the thyroid cancer lesions. Taken together, these findings suggest that we should continue to monitor the incidence of thyroid cancer in areas with high water iodine and continue to optimize population iodine intake to reduce the incidence of thyroid cancer.\n",
      "To characterize the surgical management, perioperative, and cancer specific outcomes, and the influence of aggressive histologic variants (AHV) on operative management among patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus. RCC with rhabdoid and/or sarcomatoid differentiation, which we defined as AHV, portends a worse prognosis. AHV can be associated with a desmoplastic reaction which may complicate resection.\n",
      "We reviewed patients undergoing radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy between 1990 and 2020. Comparative statistics were employed as appropriate. Survival analysis was performed according to the Kaplan-Meier method, and intergroup analysis performed with log-rank statistics. Multivariable cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the effect of AHV, age, thrombus level, vena cavectomy, metastases, and medical comorbidities on recurrence and overall survival (OS).\n",
      "Ninety-four of 403(23.3%) patients had AHV, including 43(46%) rhabdoid, 39(41%) sarcomatoid, and 12(13%) with both. AHV were more likely to present with advanced disease; however, increased perioperative complications or decreased OS were not observed. Median (IQR) survival was 16.7(4.8-47) months without AHV and 12.6(4-29) months with AHV (p=0.157). Sarcomatoid differentiation was independently associated with worse overall survival (HR=2.016, CI 1.38-2.95, p<0.001), whereas rhabdoid alone or with sarcomatoid demonstrated similar OS (p=0.063).\n",
      "RCC and IVC thrombus with AHV are more likely to present with metastatic disease, and sarcomatoid differentiation is associated with a worse OS. Resection of tumors with and without AHV have similar perioperative complications, suggesting that surgery can be safely accomplished in patients with RCC and IVC thrombus with AHV.\n"
