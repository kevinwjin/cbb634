       "  'AbstractText': \"DNA sensing is a pivotal component of the innate immune system that is responsible for detecting mislocalized DNA and triggering downstream inflammatory pathways. Among the DNA sensors, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a primary player in detecting cytosolic DNA, including foreign DNA from pathogens and self-DNA released during cellular damage, culminating in a type I interferon (IFN-I) response through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation. IFN-I cytokines are essential in mediating neuroinflammation, which is widely observed in CNS injury, neurodegeneration, and aging, suggesting an upstream role for the cGAS DNA sensing pathway. In this review, we summarize the latest developments on the cGAS-STING DNA-driven immune response in various neurological diseases and conditions. Our review covers the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cGAS activation and highlights cGAS-STING signaling in various cell types of central and peripheral nervous systems, such as resident brain immune cells, neurons, and glial cells. We then discuss the role of cGAS-STING signaling in different neurodegenerative conditions, including tauopathies, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as aging and senescence. Finally, we lay out the current advancements in research and development of cGAS inhibitors and assess the prospects of targeting cGAS and STING as therapeutic strategies for a wide spectrum of neurological diseases.\",\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"Peptides and their mimetics are increasingly recognised as drug-like molecules, particularly for intracellular protein-protein interactions too large for inhibition by small molecules, and inaccessible to larger biologics. In the past two decades, evidence associating the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein strongly implicates this protein in disease onset and progression of Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. The subsequent formation of toxic, intracellular, Lewy body deposits, in which alpha-synuclein is a major component, is a key diagnostic hallmark of the disease. To reach their therapeutic site of action, peptides must both cross the blood-brain barrier and enter dopaminergic neurons to prevent the formation of these intracellular inclusions. In this review, we describe and summarise the current efforts made in the development of peptides and their mimetics to directly engage with alpha-synuclein with the intention of modulating aggregation, and importantly, toxicity. This is a rapidly expanding field with great socioeconomic impact; these molecules harbour significant promise as therapeutics, or as early biomarkers during prodromal disease stages, or both. As these are age-dependent conditions, an increasing global life expectancy means disease prevalence is rising. No current treatments exist to either prevent or slow disease progression. It is therefore crucial that drugs are developed for these conditions before health care and social care capacities become overrun.\",\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"Sleep disturbance is a recognized risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying micro-pathological evidence remains limited. To bridge this gap, we established an amyloid-β oligomers (AβO)-induced rat model of AD and subjected it to intermittent sleep deprivation (SD). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transmission electron microscopy were employed to assess white matter (WM) integrity and ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths. Our findings demonstrated that SD exacerbated AβO-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, we found SD aggravated AβO-induced asymmetrical impairments in WM, presenting with reductions in tract integrity observed in commissural fibers and association fasciculi, particularly the right anterior commissure, right corpus callosum, and left cingulum. Ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths within the hippocampus and corpus callosum further confirmed a lateralized effect. Moreover, SD worsened AβO-induced lateralized disruption of the brain structural network, with impairments in critical nodes of the left hemisphere strongly correlated with cognitive dysfunction. This work represents the first identification of a lateralized impact of SD on the mesoscopic network and cognitive deficits in an AD rat model. These findings could deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between sleep disturbance and AD pathology, providing valuable insights into the early progression of the disease, as well as the development of neuroimaging biomarkers for screening early AD patients with self-reported sleep disturbances. Enhanced understanding of these mechanisms may pave the way for targeted interventions to alleviate cognitive decline and improve the quality of life for individuals at risk of or affected by AD. a\\xa0AβO injection and sleep deprivation were conducted on adult rats. b Sleep deprivation and AβO-induced neurotoxicity aggravated cognitive disability with a synergistic effect. c Sleep deprivation and AβO-induced neurotoxicity reduced the integrity of specific association fasciculi and commissural fibers with ultrastructural demyelination. d On the basis of white matter integrity destruction, the structural connection was disrupted.

However, the pathogenesis and etiology of AD are still not fully understood. And there are no valid treatment methods or precise diagnostic tools for AD. There is increasing evidence that P2X7R expression is upregulated in AD and is involved in multiple related pathological processes such as Aβ plaques, neurogenic fiber tangles, oxidative stress, and chronic neuroinflammation. This suggests that P2X7R may be a key player in the development of AD. P2X7R is a member of the ligand-gated purinergic receptor (P2X) family. It has received attention in neuroscience due to its role in a wide range of aging and age-related neurological disorders.

We used weight gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to evaluate the relations among co-expression modules and construct global regulatory network. Cross-talking pathways of RAF-1 in AD were identified by functional enrichment analysis. Totally, 2700 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected between AD versus non-dementia control and RAF-1-high versus low group. Among them, DEGs in turquoise module strongly associated with AD and high expression of RAF-1 were enriched in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neurotrophin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, GABAergic synapse, and axon guidance. Moreover, cross-talking pathways of RAF-1, including MAPK, VEGF, neurotrophin signaling pathways, and axon guidance, were identified by global regulatory network. The performance evaluation of AUC was 84.2%. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that oxidative phosphorylation and synapse-related biological processes were enriched in RAF-1-high and AD group. Our findings strengthened the potential roles of high RAF-1 level in AD pathogenesis, which were mediated by MAPK, VEGF, neurotrophin signaling pathways, and axon guidance.\",\n",

Furthermore, the exact trigger causing the development of one Aβ plaque morphological subtype over the other is still unknown. Here, we review the current knowledge about neuritic plaques, a subset of Aβ plaques surrounded by swollen or dystrophic neurites, which represent the most detrimental and consequential Aβ plaque morphology. Neuritic plaques have been associated with local immune activation, neuronal network dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Given that neuritic plaques are at the interface of Aβ deposition, tau aggregation, and local immune activation, we argue that understanding the exact mechanism of neuritic plaque formation is crucial to develop targeted therapies for AD.\",\n",

Emerging evidence, mostly from cell and animal models of disease, supports a role for ketosis in general, and the main circulating ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in particular, in reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation to ameliorate chronic inflammation. As a result, interventions that can induce ketosis (e.g., fasting, intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding/eating, very low-carbohydrate high-fat ketogenic diets) and/or increase circulating BHB (e.g., exogenous ketone supplementation) have garnered increasing interest for their therapeutic potential. The purpose of the present review is to summarize our current understanding of the literature on how ketogenic interventions impact the NLRP3 inflammasome across human, rodent and cell models. Overall, there is convincing evidence that ketogenic interventions, likely acting through multiple interacting mechanisms in a cell-, disease- and context-specific manner, can reduce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The evidence supports a direct effect of BHB, although it is important to consider the myriad of other metabolic responses to fasting or ketogenic diet interventions (e.g., elevated lipolysis, low insulin, stable glucose, negative energy balance) that may also impact innate immune responses.

Current methods for detecting AD pathology, however, are often expensive and invasive, limiting wide and easy access to a clinical setting. A non-invasive, cost-efficient platform, such as computerized cognitive tests, could be potentially useful to identify at-risk individuals as early as possible. In this study, we examined the diagnostic value of an episodic memory task, the mnemonic discrimination task (MDT), for predicting risk of cognitive impairment or Aβ burden. We constructed a random forest classification algorithm, utilizing MDT performance metrics and various neuropsychological test scores as input features, and assessed model performance using area under the curve (AUC). Models based on MDT performance metrics achieved classification results with an AUC of 0.83 for cognitive status and an AUC of 0.64 for Aβ status.

After inducing expression in the bacterial host, we purified the mutant and wild-type recombinant proteins using anion exchange chromatography.

       "  'AbstractText': \"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that commonly occurs in older people. It is characterized by both cognitive and functional impairment. However, as AD has an unclear pathological cause, it can be hard to diagnose with confidence. This is even more so in the early stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This paper proposes a U-Net based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) from magnetic resonance imaging - T1 weighted imaging (MRI-T1WI) for further usage in AD diagnosis including its early-stage MCI. The experiments have displayed promising results with Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) reaching 0.9714. Furthermore, three types of classifiers are developed, i.e., one Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier, two Graph Neural Network (GNN) based classifiers where one is for graph classification and the other is for node classification. 10-fold cross-validation has been conducted on all trials of experiments for classifier comparison. The performance of these three types of classifiers has been compared with the different input modalities setting and data fusion strategies. The results have shown that GNN based node classifier surpasses the other two types of classifiers, and has achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with the best accuracy at 90.18% for 3-class classification, namely AD, MCI and normal control (NC) with the synthesized fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) features fused at the input level. Moreover, involving synthesized FDG-PET as part of the input with proper data fusion strategies has also proved to enhance all three types of classifiers' performance. This work provides support for the notion that machine learning-derived image analysis may be a useful approach to improving the diagnosis of AD.\",\n",

The Au-Cu alloy NPs were prepared via a co-reduction reaction, exhibiting excellent conductivity and catalytic activity. These properties remarkably enhanced the ECL of luminol, providing a suitable background for the sensing response. After the Au-Cu NPs were decorated on the surface of indium tin oxide glass using 3-amino-propyl trimethoxysilane, the antibody of p-tau217 was immobilized via dominant Au-N bonding to enable the biological specificity of the immunosensor. When p-tau217 specifically interacted with an antibody to form an immune complex on the sensing interface, the ECL signal of the sensor was considerably inhibited by the resulting giant biomolecular complex. This complex prevented luminol diffusion to the electrode surface and electron transfer. The resulting immunosensor showed remarkable sensitivity to p-tau217, with a wide linear detection range from 5 to 600 pg/mL. A detection limit of 0.56 pg/mL was achieved, with recoveries in human serum ranging from 92.3 to 109%. This ECL immunosensor demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity toward p-tau217, along with good reproducibility and stability, providing a new approach for clinical research on Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

Multifunctional macromolecular structures play an important role in inhibiting the aggregate formation of amyloidogenic materials and thus are promising candidates with antiamyloidogenic characteristics for the development of next-generation therapeutics. In this study, we evaluate how small differences in the dendritic topology of these structures influence their antiamyloidogenic activity by the comparison of \"perfectly dendritic\" and \"pseudodendritic\" macromolecules, both decorated with mannose units. Their compactness, the position of surface units, and the size of glyco-architectures influence their antiamyloidogenic activity against Aβ 40, a major component of amyloid plaques. For the advanced analysis of the aggregation of the Aβ peptide, we introduce asymmetric flow field flow fractionation as a suitable method for the quantification of large and delicate structures. This alternative method focuses on the quantification of complex aggregates of Aβ 40 and glycodendrimer/glyco-pseudodendrimer over different time intervals of incubation, showing a good correlation to ThT assay and CD spectroscopy results. Kinetic studies of the second-generation glyco-pseudodendrimer revealed maximum inhibition of Aβ 40 aggregates, verified with atomic force microscopy. The second-generation glyco-pseudodendrimer shows the best antiamyloidogenic properties confirming that macromolecular conformation in combination with optimal functional group distribution is the key to its performance. These molecular properties were validated and confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation.',\n",

Here, we used a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based computational approach and identified small molecule candidates that reduce the nuclear liquid-liquid phase separation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), an essential protein that undergoes phase transition in neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrated that the GCN-based deep learning algorithm is suitable for spatial information extraction from the molecular graph. Thus, this is a promising method to identify small molecule candidates with novel scaffolds. Furthermore, we validated that these candidates do not affect the normal splicing function of TDP-43.

During life, the BBB can be subjected to a wide range of perturbations or stresses that may be endogenous or exogenous, pathological or therapeutic, or intended or unintended. The risk factors for many diseases of the brain are multifactorial and involve perturbations that may occur simultaneously (e.g., two-hit model for Alzheimer's disease) and result in different outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand the influence of individual perturbations on BBB function in isolation. Here we review the effects of eight perturbations: mechanical forces, temperature, electromagnetic radiation, hypoxia, endogenous factors, exogenous factors, chemical factors, and pathogens. While some perturbations may result in acute or chronic BBB disruption, many are also exploited for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The resultant outcome on BBB function depends on the dose (or magnitude) and duration of the perturbation. Homeostasis may be restored by self-repair, for example, via processes such as proliferation of affected cells or angiogenesis to create new vasculature. Transient or sustained BBB dysfunction may result in acute or pathological symptoms, for example, microhemorrhages or hypoperfusion. In more extreme cases, perturbations may lead to cytotoxicity and cell death, for example, through exposure to cytotoxic plaques.\",\n",

The risk of being diagnosed with AD increases the risk for epilepsy, and in parallel, a history of epilepsy increases the likelihood of the development of AD. This bi-directional relationship may be due to underlying shared pathophysiologic hallmarks, including decreased cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), increased hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and hippocampal hyperexcitability. Additionally, there are practical treatment considerations in patients with co-morbid AD and epilepsy-namely, there is a higher risk of seizures associated with medications commonly prescribed for Alzheimer's disease patients, including antidepressants and antipsychotics such as trazodone, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and first-generation neuroleptics. Anti-amyloid antibodies like aducanumab and lecanemab present new and unique considerations in patients with co-morbid AD and epilepsy given the risk of seizures associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) seen with this drug class. Finally, we identify and detail five active studies, including two clinical trials of levetiracetam in the respective treatment of cognition and neuropsychiatric features of AD, a study characterizing the prevalence of epilepsy in AD via prolonged EEG monitoring, a study characterizing AD biomarkers in late-onset epilepsy, and a study evaluating hyperexcitability in AD.

It serves as a design for cellular machinery that permits cells, organs, and even whole organisms to work. The fidelity of DNA replication results from the action of hundreds of genes involved in proofreading and damage repair. All human cells can acquire genetic changes in their DNA all over life. Genetic mutations are changes to the DNA sequence that happen during cell division when the cells make copies of themselves. Mutations in the DNA can cause genetic illnesses such as cancer, or they could help humans better adapt to their environment over time. The endogenous reactive metabolites, therapeutic medicines, and an excess of environmental mutagens, such as UV rays all continuously damage DNA, compromising its integrity. One or more chromosomal alterations and point mutations at a single site (monogenic mutation) including deletions, duplications, and inversions illustrate such DNA mutations. Genetic conditions can occur when an altered gene is inherited from parents, which increases the risk of developing that particular condition, or some gene alterations can happen randomly. Moreover, symptoms of genetic conditions depend on which gene has a mutation. There are many different diseases and conditions caused by mutations. Some of the most common genetic conditions are Alzheimer's disease, some cancers, cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, and sickle cell disease. Interestingly, scientists find that DNA mutations are more common than formerly thought. This review outlines the main DNA mutations that occur along the human genome and their influence on human health.\",\n",

Here, we investigate proteasome function and localization at synapses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) post-mortem brain tissue and in experimental models. We found a marked increase in ubiquitinylated proteins in post-mortem AD hippocampi compared to controls. Using several experimental models, we show that amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs) inhibit synaptic proteasome activity and trigger a reduction in synaptic proteasome content. We further show proteasome inhibition specifically in hippocampal synaptic fractions derived from APPswePS1ΔE9 mice. Reduced synaptic proteasome activity instigated by AβOs is corrected by treatment with rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, in mice. Results further show that dynein inhibition blocks AβO-induced reduction in dendritic proteasome content in hippocampal neurons. Finally, proteasome inhibition induces AD-like pathological features, including reactive oxygen species and dendritic spine loss in hippocampal neurons, inhibition of hippocampal mRNA translation, and memory impairment in mice.

Although astrocytosis is known to occur in neurodegenerative diseases, it is currently unknown how the severity of astrocytosis is correlated with the common combinations of pathologies in aging brains. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed a convenience sample of autopsied subjects from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center community-based autopsy cohort. The subjects were stratified into 5 groups (n\\u2009=\\u200951 total): pure ADNC, ADNC + LATE-NC, ADNC + HS-A, ADNC + LATE-NC + HS-A, and low-pathology controls. Following GFAP immunostaining and digital slide scanning with a ScanScope, we measured GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytosis. The severities of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytosis in hippocampal subfield CA1 and subiculum were compared between groups. The group with ADNC + LATE-NC + HS-A had the most astrocytosis as operationalized by either any GFAP+ or strong GFAP+ immunoreactivity in both CA1 and subiculum. In comparison to that pathologic combination, ADNC + HS or ADNC + LATE-NC alone showed lower astrocytosis. Pure ADNC had only marginally increased astrocytosis in CA1 and subiculum, in comparison to low-pathology controls. We conclude that there appeared to be pathogenetic synergy such that ADNC + LATE-NC + HS-A cases had relatively high levels of astrocytosis in the hippocampal formation.\",\n",

Although these outcomes are not without some degree of divisiveness, the fact remains that targeting amyloid for removal has finally shown at least modest efficacy in slowing the otherwise relentless progression of the disease.

Few studies have examined the relationship between brain pathologies, atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and APOE status in those with the ɛ2ɛ4 genotype and results are inconsistent for those with an ɛ2 allele. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging participants were divided into one of four APOE allele profiles (E4= ɛ4ɛ4 or ɛ3 ɛ4; E2= ɛ2ɛ2 or ɛ2ɛ3; E3= ɛ3ɛ3; or E24= ɛ2ɛ4). Linear mixed models examined the relationship between APOE profiles and brain changes (i.e., regional WMHs, ventricle size, hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume, amyloid level, and phosphorylated tau measures), while controlling for age, sex, education, and diagnostic status at baseline and over time. APOE ɛ4 is associated with increased pathology while ɛ2 positivity is associated with reduced baseline and lower accumulation of pathologies and neurodegeneration. APOE ɛ2ɛ4 is similar to ɛ4 (increased neurodegeneration) but with a slower rate of change. The strong associations observed between APOE and pathology show the importance of how genetic factors influence structural brain changes. These findings suggest that ɛ2ɛ4 genotype is related to increased declines associated with the ɛ4 as opposed to the protective effects of the ɛ2. These findings have important implications for initiating treatments and interventions. Given that people with the ɛ2ɛ4 genotype can expect to have increased atrophy, they should be considered (alongside those with an ɛ4) in targeted interventions to reduce brain changes that occur with AD.\",\n",

Such a capability, however, is of great importance since it can improve patient management by providing information on the speed of disease progression already at the admission stage, or it can enrich the clinical trials with fast progressors and avoid the need for control arms by the means of digital twins. In this work, we develop a deep learning method that models the evolution of age-related disease by processing a single medical scan and providing a segmentation of the target anatomy at a requested future point in time. Our method represents a time-invariant physical process and solves a large-scale problem of modeling temporal pixel-level changes utilizing NeuralODEs. In addition, we demonstrate the approaches to incorporate the prior domain-specific constraints into our method and define temporal Dice loss for learning temporal objectives. To evaluate the applicability of our approach across different age-related diseases and imaging modalities, we developed and tested the proposed method on the datasets with 967 retinal OCT volumes of 100 patients with Geographic Atrophy and 2823 brain MRI volumes of 633 patients with Alzheimer's Disease. For Geographic Atrophy, the proposed method outperformed the related baseline models in the atrophy growth prediction.

The lithium treatment widely used in neurological disorders can alter the AChE activity, yet the underlying mechanism of how the ion species regulate the enzymatic activity remains unclear. In this work, we performed combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and well-tempered metadynamics to understand the modulation of human AChE (hAChE) activity using three alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, and K+) in different concentrations. Our simulations show that the binding affinity and catalytic activity are affected by different ion species through allosteric ion coordination geometries on the hAChE complex and distant electrostatic screening effect. A Li+ cluster involving D330, E393, and D397 residues and three Li+ ions was found to be highly conserved and can be critical to the enzyme activity. Binding energy calculations indicate that the electrostatic screening from allosterically bound cations can affect the key residues at the catalytic site and active-site gorge, including E199. Furthermore, an increase in ion concentration can lead to lower reactivity, especially for Li+ ions, which exhibit more cation-hAChE contacts than Na+ and K+. The selective ion binding and their preferred modulation on hAChE are highly related to ion species. This work provides a molecular perspective on selective modulation by different ion species of the enzyme catalytic processes.\",\n",

Development of a PET tracer would therefore be an essential tool for developing therapeutic small-molecule inhibitors of OGA, enabling clinical testing of target engagement and dose selection. Methods: A collection of small-molecule compounds was screened for inhibitory activity and high-affinity binding to OGA, as well as favorable PET tracer attributes (multidrug resistance protein 1 efflux, central nervous system PET multiparameter optimization, etc.). Two lead compounds with high affinity and selectivity for OGA were selected for further profiling, including OGA binding to tissue homogenate using a radioligand competition binding assay. In vivo pharmacokinetics were established using a microdosing approach with unlabeled compounds in rats. In vivo imaging studies were performed in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with 11C-labeled compounds. Results: Two selected candidates, BIO-735 and BIO-578, displayed promising attributes in\\xa0vitro.

Speakers\\' topics spanned the translational research spectrum. Session 1 provided an overview of the geroscience and health span (disease-free and functional health throughout life) concepts. The common molecular mechanisms between oral cancer and aging were discussed, and research was presented that showed periodontal microflora as a potential factor in Alzheimer\\'s disease progression. Session 2 focused on behavioral and social science aspects of aging and their oral health significance. The keynote provided evidence that loneliness and isolation can have major health effects. These social conditions, along with poor oral health, tooth loss, and cognitive decline, could potentially affect healthy eating ability and systemic health in older adults. Research could help elucidate the directions and pathways connecting these seemingly disparate conditions. Session 3 focused on the delivery of oral care in different settings and the many barriers to access care faced by older adults. Research is needed to identify and implement effective technology and strategies to improve access to dental care, including new delivery and financing mechanisms, workforce models, interprofessional provider education and practice, and use of big data from medical-dental integration of electronic health records. Research to improve the \"oral health span,\" reduce oral health disparities, and increase health equity must be tackled at all levels from biologic pathways to social determinants of health and health policies.',\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"Spatial navigation is more difficult and effortful for older than younger individuals, a shift which occurs for a variety of neurological, physical, and cognitive reasons associated with aging. Despite a large body of evidence documenting age-related deficits in spatial navigation, comparatively less research addresses how to facilitate more effective navigation behavior for older adults. Since navigation challenges arise for a variety of reasons in old age, a one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely to work. Here, we introduce a framework for the variety of spatial navigation challenges faced in aging, which we call LOST-Location, Orientation, Spatial mapping, and Transit. The LOST framework builds on evidence from the cognitive neuroscience of spatial navigation, which reveals distinct components underpinning human wayfinding. We evaluate research on navigational aids-devices and depictions-which help people find their way around; and we reflect on how navigation aids solve (or fail to solve) specific wayfinding difficulties faced by older adults. In summary, we emphasize a bespoke approach to improving spatial navigation in aging, which focuses on tailoring navigation solutions to specific navigation challenges. Our hope is that by providing precise support to older navigators, navigation opportunities can facilitate independence and exploration, while minimizing the danger of becoming lost. We conclude by delineating critical knowledge gaps in how to improve older adults' spatial navigation capacities that the novel LOST framework could guide to address.

We downloaded AD and CKD datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and analyzed differentially expressed genes and weighted gene co-expression networks to identify candidate genes for AD and CKD. We used a combination of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest algorithms to select the shared genes. Subsequently, we shared genes and performed an immune infiltration analysis to investigate the association between different immune cell types and shared genes. Finally, we elucidated the relationship between the expression levels of the shared genes in disease samples and cells using single-cell analysis. Our analysis identified 150 candidate genes that may be primarily involved in immune inflammatory responses and energy metabolism pathways. We found that JunD Proto-Oncogene, ALF transcription elongation factor 1, and ZFP36 Ring Finger Protein Like 1 were the best co-diagnostic markers for AD and CKD based on the results of Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator analysis and the random forest algorithm. Based on the results of immune infiltration analysis, macrophages and T-cells play a significant role in the progression of AD and CKD. Our scRNA-sequencing data showed that the 3 shared genes in AD were significantly expressed in astrocytes, excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and MAIT cells. The 3 shared genes in CKD were significantly expressed in oligodendrocytes, neutrophils, fibroblasts, astrocytes, and T-cells.

       "  'AbstractText': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects various brain cell types, including astrocytes, which are the most abundant cell types in the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes not only provide homeostatic support to neurons but also actively regulate synaptic signaling and functions and become reactive in response to CNS insults through diverse signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT, NF-κB, and GPCR-elicited pathways. The advent of new technology for transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level has led to increasing recognition of the highly versatile nature of reactive astrocytes and the context-dependent specificity of astrocyte reactivity. In AD, reactive astrocytes have long been observed in senile plaques and have recently been suggested to play a role in AD pathogenesis and progression. However, the precise contributions of reactive astrocytes to AD remain elusive, and targeting this complex cell population for AD treatment poses significant challenges. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of astrocyte reactivity and its role in AD, with a particular focus on the signaling pathways that promote astrocyte reactivity and the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes. Furthermore, we explore potential implications for the development of therapeutics for AD. Our objective is to shed light on the complex involvement of astrocytes in AD and offer insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for treating and managing this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.\",\n",

Recently, geometric deep learning, especially Graph Neural Networks, has shown promising performance in molecular science applications. However, most existing works often impose targeted inductive biases to a specific molecular system, and are inefficient when applied to macromolecules or large-scale tasks, thereby limiting their applications to many real-world problems. To address these challenges, we present PAMNet, a universal framework for accurately and efficiently learning the representations of three-dimensional (3D) molecules of varying sizes and types in any molecular system. Inspired by molecular mechanics, PAMNet induces a physics-informed bias to explicitly model local and non-local interactions and their combined effects. As a result, PAMNet can reduce expensive operations, making it time and memory efficient. In extensive benchmark studies, PAMNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines regarding both accuracy and efficiency in three diverse learning tasks: small molecule properties, RNA 3D structures, and protein-ligand binding affinities. Our results highlight the potential for PAMNet in a broad range of molecular science applications.',\n",

The gut has an immense capacity to generate free radicals whose role in the etiopathogenesis of AD is well-known; however, it remains to be clarified whether gastrointestinal redox homeostasis is associated with the development of AD. The aim was to (i) examine gastrointestinal redox homeostasis in the presymptomatic and symptomatic Tg2576 mouse model of AD; (ii) investigate the effects of oral d-galactose previously shown to alleviate cognitive deficits and metabolic changes in animal models of AD and reduce gastrointestinal oxidative stress; and (iii) investigate the association between gastrointestinal redox biomarkers and behavioral alterations in Tg2576 mice. In the presymptomatic stage, Tg2576 mice displayed an increased gastrointestinal electrophilic tone, characterized by higher lipid peroxidation and elevated Mn/Fe-SOD activity. In the symptomatic stage, these alterations are rectified, but the total antioxidant capacity is decreased. Chronic oral d-galactose increased the antioxidant capacity and reduced lipid peroxidation in the Tg2576 but had the opposite effects in the wild-type animals. The total antioxidant capacity of the gastrointestinal tract was associated with greater spatial memory. Gut redox homeostasis might be involved in the development and progression of AD pathophysiology and should be further explored in this context.\",\n",

The human RAB26 (member RAS oncogene family) directs synaptic and secretory vesicles into preautophagosomal structures, inhibition of which specifically disrupts axonal transport of degradative organelles and leads to an axonal dystrophy, resembling Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human RAB26 contains a GCC repeat in the top 1st percent in respect of length. Here we sequenced this STR in 441 Iranian individuals, consisting of late-onset neurocognitive disorder (NCD) (N=216) and controls (N=225). In both groups, the 12-repeat allele and the 12/12 genotype were predominantly abundant. We found excess of homozygosity for non-12 alleles in the NCD group (Mid-P exact=0.027). Furthermore, divergent genotypes were detected that were specific to the NCD group (2.8% of genotypes) (Mid-P exact=0.006) or controls (3.1% of genotypes) (Mid-P exact=0.004). The patients harboring divergent genotypes received the diagnosis of AD. Based on the predominant abundance of the 12-repeat and 12/12 genotype in both groups, excess of non-12 homozygosity in the NCD group, and divergent genotypes across the NCD and control groups, we propose natural selection at this locus and link with late-onset AD.

This was addressed in the present study by investigating the effect of chronic neuropathic pain on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive impairment using amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice subjected to spared-nerve injury (SNI). The Von Frey test was performed to determine the mechanical threshold of mouse hind limbs after SNI. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory. Doublecortin-positive (DCX+), 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)+, BrdU+/neuronal nuclei (NeuN)+, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)+ neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. CCL2 and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) protein levels in the mouse hippocampus were analyzed by western blotting. The results showed that APP/PS1 mice with chronic neuropathic pain induced by SNI had significant learning and memory impairment. This was accompanied by increased CCL2 and CCR2 expression and decreases in the number of DCX+, BrdU+, and BrdU+/NeuN+ neurons. These results suggest that chronic neuropathic pain is associated with cognitive impairment, which may be caused by CCL2/CCR2 signaling-mediated inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, therapeutic strategies that alleviate neuropathic pain can potentially slow cognitive decline in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.\",\n",

Despite its multifaceted impact in the brain, the exact physiological and molecular mechanism by which SSRIs such as Citalopram improve neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in dementia is poorly understood. In the current study, we investigated the protective role of SSRI, Citalopram, in serotonergic, medullary raphe neurons (RN46A-B14). RN46A-B14 cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant APP and Tau cDNAs for 24\\u202fh and then treated with 20\\u202fμM Cit for 24\\u202fh. We then assessed mRNA and protein levels of p-Tau, total Tau, serotonin related proteins such as TPH2, SERT, and 5HTR1a, synaptic proteins and cytoskeletal structure. We also assessed cell survival, mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial morphology. The mutant APP and Tau transfected cells showed increased levels of serotonin related proteins and mRNA, while the mRNA and protein levels of synaptic proteins were downregulated. Citalopram treatment significantly reduced pathologically p-Tau level along with the serotonin related protein levels. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the mRNA and protein levels of synaptic genes and cytoskeletal structure in the treated groups. Further, Citalopram also improved cell survival, mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial morphology in Citalopram treated cells that express mAPP and mTau. Taken together these findings suggest Citalopram could not only be a promising therapeutic drug for treating patients with depression, but also for AD patients.\",\n",

The results showed that several probes exhibited significant changes in fluorescence intensity at wavelengths greater than 600\\xa0nm when they were bound to Aβ aggregates compared to the Aβ monomeric form. Among the tested probes, four D-π-A type indane derivatives showed promising binding selectivity to Aβ aggregates over non-specific proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). The molecular docking study showed that our compounds were appropriately located along the Aβ fibril axis through the hydrophobic tunnel structure. Further analysis revealed that the most active compound having dimethylaminopyridyl group as an election donor and dicyano group as an electron acceptor could effectively stain Aβ plaques in brain tissue samples from AD transgenic mice. These findings suggest that our indane-based compounds have the potential to serve as fluorescent probes for the detection and monitoring of Aβ aggregation in AD.\",\n",

However, little is known about why these sex differences in prevalence rate exist. In the current longitudinal task fMRI study, we explored whether there were sex differences in the patterns of memory decline and brain activity during object-location (spatial context) encoding and retrieval in a large sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Novel or Experimental Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (PREVENT-AD) program who are at heightened risk of developing AD due to having a family history (+FH) of the disease. The goal of the study was to gain insight into whether there are sex differences in the neural correlates of episodic memory decline, which may advance knowledge about sex-specific patterns in the natural progression to AD. Our results indicate that +FH females performed better than +FH males at both baseline and follow-up on neuropsychological and task fMRI measures of episodic memory. Moreover, multivariate data-driven task fMRI analysis identified generalized patterns of longitudinal decline in medial temporal lobe activity that was paralleled by longitudinal increases in lateral prefrontal cortex, caudate and midline cortical activity during successful episodic retrieval and novelty detection in +FH males, but not females. Post-hoc analyses indicated that higher education had a stronger effect on +FH females neuropsychological scores compared to +FH males. We conclude that higher educational attainment may have a greater neuroprotective effect in older +FH females compared to +FH males.\",\n",

Using our genome-wide BP database, we delineated the BP-ACC segments of all human introns and found extreme depletion of AG/YAG in the [BP+8, ACC-4] high-risk region. We developed AGAIN as a genome-wide computational approach to systematically and precisely pinpoint intronic AG-gain variants within the BP-ACC regions. AGAIN identified 350 AG-gain variants from the Human Gene Mutation Database, all of which alter splicing and cause disease. Among them, 74% created new acceptor sites, whereas 31% resulted in complete exon skipping. AGAIN also predicts the protein-level products resulting from these two consequences. We performed AGAIN on our exome/genomes database of patients with severe infectious diseases but without known genetic etiology and identified a private homozygous intronic AG-gain variant in the antimycobacterial gene SPPL2A in a patient with mycobacterial disease. AGAIN also predicts a retention of six intronic nucleotides that encode an in-frame stop codon, turning AG-gain into stop-gain. This allele was then confirmed experimentally to lead to loss of function by disrupting splicing. We further showed that AG-gain variants inside the high-risk region led to misspliced products, while those outside the region did not, by two case studies in genes STAT1 and IRF7. We finally evaluated AGAIN on our 14 paired exome-RNAseq samples and found that 82% of AG-gain variants in high-risk regions showed evidence of missplicing.

VH are a major predictor of dementia in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and are included as a core clinical feature in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). A newly developed Noise Pareidolia Test (NPT) was proposed as a possible surrogate marker for VH in DLB patients as increased pareidolic responses correlated with informant-corroborated accounts of VH. This association could, however, be mediated by visuoperceptual impairment. To understand the drivers of performance on the NPT, we contrasted performances in patient groups that varied both in terms of visuoperceptual ability and rates of VH. N = 43 patients were studied of whom n = 13 had DLB or PD with Dementia (PDD); n = 13 had PD; n = 12 had typical, memory-onset Alzheimer's Disease (tAD); and n = 5 had Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) due to Alzheimer's disease. All patient groups reported pareidolias. Within the Lewy body disorders (PD, DLB, PDD), there was no significant difference in pareidolic response rates between hallucinating and non-hallucinating patients. Visuoperceptual deficits and pareidolic responses were most frequent in the PCA group-none of whom reported VH. Regression analyses in the entire patient cohort indicated that pareidolias were strongly predicted by visuoperceptual impairment but not by the presence of VH. These findings suggest that pareidolias reflect the underlying visuoperceptual impairment of Lewy body disorders, rather than being a direct marker for VH.\",\n",

However, in most current works, learning under different views has significant independency, overlooking common information mapping patterns that exist between these views. This paper proposes a Structure Mapping Generative adversarial network (SM-GAN) framework, which utilizes the consistency and complementarity of multi-view data from the innovative perspective of information mapping. Specifically, based on network-structured multi-view data, a structural information mapping model is proposed to capture hierarchical interaction patterns among views. Subsequently, three different types of graph convolutional operations are designed in SM-GAN based on the model. Compared with regular GAN, we add a structural information mapping module between the encoder and decoder wthin the generator, completing the structural information mapping from the micro-view to the macro-view. This paper conducted sufficient validation experiments using public imaging genetics data in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. It is shown that SM-GAN outperforms baseline and advanced methods in multi-label classification and evolution prediction tasks.\",\n",

G4s folded in proximal promoter regions (PPR) are associated either with positive or negative transcriptional regulation. Given that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) affecting G4 folding (G4-Vars) may alter gene transcription, and that SNVs are associated with the human diseases' onset, we undertook a novel comprehensive study of the G4-Vars genome-wide (G4-variome) to find disease-associated G4-Vars located into PPRs. We developed a bioinformatics strategy to find disease-related SNVs located into PPRs simultaneously overlapping with putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs). We studied five G4-Vars disturbing in vitro the folding and stability of the G4s located into PPRs, which had been formerly associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (GRIN2B), a severe familiar coagulopathy (F7), atopic dermatitis (CSF2), myocardial infarction (SIRT1)\\xa0and deafness (LHFPL5). Results obtained in cultured cells for these five G4-Vars suggest that the changes in the G4s affect the transcription, potentially contributing to the development of the mentioned diseases. Collectively, data reinforce the general idea that G4-Vars may impact on the different susceptibilities to human genetic diseases' onset, and could be novel targets for diagnosis and drug design in precision medicine.\",\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is traditionally considered as a brain disorder featured by amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition. The current study on whether pathological changes of AD extend to the enteric nervous system (ENS) is still in its infancy. In this study, we found enteric Aβ deposition, intestinal dysfunction, and colonic inflammation in the young APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, these mice exhibited cholinergic and nitrergic signaling pathways damages and enteric neuronal loss. Our data show that Aβ42 treatment remarkably affected the gene expression of cultured myenteric neurons and the spontaneous contraction of intestinal smooth muscles. The intra-colon administration of Aβ42 induced ENS dysfunction, brain gliosis, and β-amyloidosis-like changes in the wild-type mice. Our results suggest that ENS mirrors the neuropathology observed in AD brains, and intestinal pathological changes may represent the prodromal events, which contribute to brain pathology in AD. In summary, our findings provide new opportunities for AD early diagnosis and prevention.\",\n",

This study examines how COVID-19 restrictions impacted various dementia risk factors and social determinants of health among older adults. Data came from the Systematic Multi-Domain Alzheimer's Risk Reduction Trial, a randomized controlled trial of a multi-domain intervention in higher-risk older adults (aged 70-89). A questionnaire was administered to participants (n = 156; 90.7% response rate) between May 2020 and March 2021. The data show a significant decline in social activity, physical activity, and mood among respondents. Compared to living with others, living alone was associated with worsened physical activity, diet, and subjective memory/thinking, adjusted for sex and age. These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated several risk factors for dementia in older adults, particularly in those living alone.\",\n",

       "  'AbstractText': 'Recent research indicates that multiple sclerosis is preceded by a prodromal phase with elevated levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), a marker of axonal injury. The effect of environmental risk factors on the extent of axonal injury during this prodrome is unknown. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study was to determine if HHV-6A serostatus is associated with the level of sNfL in the multiple sclerosis prodrome, which would support a causative role of HHV-6A. A nested case-control study was performed by crosslinking multiple sclerosis registries with Swedish biobanks. Individuals with biobank samples collected before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis were included as cases. Controls without multiple sclerosis were randomly selected, matched for biobank, sex, sampling date and age. Serostatus of HHV-6A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was analysed with a bead-based multiplex assay. The concentration of sNfL was analysed with Single molecule array technology. The association between HHV-6A serology and sNfL was assessed by stratified t-tests and linear regressions, adjusted for EBV serostatus and sampling age. Within-pair ratios of HHV-6A seroreactivity and sNfL were calculated for each case and its matched control. To assess the temporal relationship between HHV-6A antibodies and sNfL, these ratios were plotted against the time to the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis and compared using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing regressions with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Samples from 519 matched case-control pairs were included. In cases, seropositivity of HHV-6A was significantly associated with the level of sNfL (+11%, 95% CI 0.2-24%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.045), and most pronounced in the younger half of the cases (+24%, 95% CI 6-45%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.007). No such associations were observed among the controls. Increasing seroreactivity against HHV-6A was detectable before the rise of sNfL (significant within-pair ratios from 13.6 years vs 6.6 years before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis). In this study, we describe the association between HHV-6A antibodies and the degree of axonal injury in the multiple sclerosis prodrome. The findings indicate that elevated HHV-6A antibodies both precede and are associated with a higher degree of axonal injury, supporting the hypothesis that HHV-6A infection may contribute to multiple sclerosis development in a proportion of cases.',\n",

The inherent barrier properties of the BBB pose a challenge for therapeutic drug delivery into the CNS to treat neurological diseases. Impaired BBB function has been related to neurological disease. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the deposition of amyloid in the cerebral vasculature leading to a compromised BBB, is a co-morbidity in most cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that BBB dysfunction or breakdown may be involved in neurodegeneration. Due to limited access to human BBB tissue, the mechanisms that contribute to proper BBB function and BBB degeneration remain unknown. To address these limitations, we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived BBB (iBBB) by incorporating endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes in a 3D matrix. The iBBB self-assembles to recapitulate the anatomy and cellular interactions present in the BBB. Seeding iBBBs with amyloid captures key aspects of CAA. Additionally, the iBBB offers a flexible platform to modulate genetic and environmental factors implicated in cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration, to investigate how genetics and lifestyle affect disease risk. Finally, the iBBB can be used for drug screening and medicinal chemistry studies to optimize therapeutic\\xa0delivery to the CNS. In this protocol, we describe the differentiation of the three types of cells (endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes) arising from human pluripotent stem cells, how to assemble the differentiated cells into the iBBB, and how to model CAA in vitro using exogenous amyloid. This model overcomes the challenge of studying live human brain tissue with a system that has both biological fidelity and experimental flexibility, and enables the interrogation of the human BBB and its role in neurodegeneration.\",\n",

Beyond addressing the fundamental problems, it has been used as a fantastic model organism for human disease research. Being an insect, Drosophila has a robust and advanced olfactory system that has been used many times as a model neuronal circuit to study fundamental questions in neurobiology. The circuit is well-explored at anatomical, physiological, and functional levels. It provides several advantages for the study of neurobiological disorders, such as spatiotemporally regulated misexpression or knockdown of disease proteins, genetic tractability, well-studied neuroanatomy, simple behavioural training paradigms, and quantifiable assays. Hence, Drosophila olfaction has been a favourite choice for the study of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome, etc. This review aims to discuss earlier progress and future scope in using the Drosophila olfactory system for modelling human neurological pathophysiology for conducting fundamental and applied research. A major goal of research in biological science is to alleviate human disease burden. Diverse experimental systems are required to address different aspects of disease aetiology. Drosophila is one of the finest in vivo systems; its olfactory system is arguably the most well-characterized circuit for modelling human neurological disorders. A vast amount of research has been conducted to decipher cellular, molecular, and even cognitive aspects of human disorders using the Drosophila olfactory system. This review aims at summarizing such research progress to date and critically analysing the suitability of this system for modelling more complex neurological conditions.\",\n",

Methods and Results Using 2013 to 2017 US Medicare claims linked to Minimum Data Set records, we conducted a retrospective cohort study. We identified DOAC initiators (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban) aged ≥65\\u2009years with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation residing in a nursing home. We estimated inverse-probability of treatment weights for DOAC dose using propensity scores. We examined safety (hospitalization for major bleeding) and effectiveness outcomes (all-cause mortality, thrombosis [myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, venous thromboembolism]). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs using cause-specific hazard-regression models. Of 21\\u2009878 DOAC initiators, 48% received reduced dosing. The mean age of residents was 82.0\\u2009years, 66% were female, and 31% had moderate/severe cognitive impairment. After estimating inverse-probability of treatment weights, standard dosing was associated with a higher rate of bleeding (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.03-1.37]; 9.4 versus 8.0 events per 100 person-years). Standard-dose therapy was associated with the highest rates of bleeding among those aged >80\\u2009years (9.1 versus 6.7 events per 100\\u2009person-years) and with a body mass index <30\\u2009kg/m2 (9.4 versus 7.4 events per 100\\u2009person-years).

Conclusions In this nationwide study of nursing home residents with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, we found a higher rate of bleeding and little difference in effectiveness of standard versus reduced-dose DOAC treatment.

AD patients usually present symptoms, such as cognitive dysfunction, progressive memory loss, and other manifestations. With the increasing number of AD cases worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop effective drug treatments. Currently, drugs targeting AD symptoms may not change or prevent the progression of the disease. Curcumin, a polyphenol extracted from the turmeric herb, has been used for the treatment of AD. In this review, we summarized both cellular and animal studies and described the mechanism of action of curcumin in altering the pathological features of AD. Curcumin attenuates the formation of amyloid-β plaques and promotes its decomposition, reduces the phosphorylation of tau, improves its clearance rate, and binds with copper to reduce cholesterol. It changes the activity of microglia, suppresses acetylcholinesterase, regulates insulin signal transduction, and exhibits antioxidant properties. Studies have found that curcumin can promote nerve repair and has a significant effect on AD. However, the low bioavailability of curcumin may hinder its use as a therapeutic agent. If this limitation can be overcome, curcumin may emerge as a promising drug for the treatment of AD.\",\n",

Water maze and immunohistochemical experiments demonstrated that AST significantly improved the cognitive level of APP/PS1 mice and reduced Aβ deposition in the cortex. After the dietary intake of AST, the composition and level of 84 GLS molecular species in the mouse cortex were determined using the LC-MS strategy. The results showed that the total GLS was reduced, most complex GLS was decreased, and simple GLS (GM3 and GM1a) was increased in the APP/PS1 mouse cortex. Notably, F-AST mainly regulated complex GLS (p < 0.001), whereas AST-DHA primarily reacted with simple GLS (p < 0.001). OAc-GQ1a(38:1), OAc-GQ1a(36:1), GD1a(36:1), and GM3(38:1) decreased 3.73, 2.31, and 2.29-fold and increased 3.54-fold, respectively, and were identified as potential AD biomarkers in the cortices of APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, the AST diet significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of GLS synthesizing genes (st3gal5, st8sia1, b3galt4, st3fal2, and soat) and siae (p < 0.05) and down-regulated that of the GLS catabolizing gene hexa (p < 0.01).

The preclinical incubation period of AD starts in midlife, providing a critical window for identification and optimization of AD risk factors. Studies link AD with CVD risk factors such as hypertension, inflammation, and dyslipidemia. Both AD and CVD are progressive diseases with decades-long development periods. CVD can clinically manifest several years earlier than AD, making CVD and its risk factors a potential predictor of future AD. The current review focuses on the state of literature on molecular and metabolic pathways modulating the heart-brain axis underlying the potential association of midlife CVD risk factors and their effect on AD and related dementias.

If left untreated, agitation can lead to poorer quality of life and increased hospitalisation and strain for family carers. Often these symptoms are treated with medications that are usually used to manage psychosis (antipsychotic drugs), but such medication has limited effectiveness and can cause serious adverse effects to patients, including risk of increased death. Two medications that are already commonly prescribed for other health issues, mirtazapine (an antidepressant) and carbamazepine (a drug used to treat epilepsy), had been identified as a possible alternative way of treating agitation in Alzheimer’s disease that might not have the harms associated with antipsychotic medication. In this study, we compared the effects of giving mirtazapine or carbamazepine with a dummy drug (placebo) in people with Alzheimer’s disease who were experiencing agitation. The results of the study showed that neither medication was any more effective than the placebo in reducing agitation over 12 weeks in terms of improving symptoms, or in economic terms. Mirtazapine may lead to additional carer costs as compared to placebo. The study findings are stronger for mirtazapine than carbamazepine because the carbamazepine arm was stopped when it had recruited less than half the numbers needed. That was done because the study was not recruiting quickly enough to support both the mirtazapine and the carbamazepine arms. The findings from this study show that mirtazapine should not be recommended to treat agitation in Alzheimer’s disease. More work is needed to formulate effective ways and to test new drug and non-drug treatments for agitation in dementia.',\n",

With downstream functional effect predictions, a single variation (rs182024939: K > N) of the MAPT gene with nine transcript SNPs was identified as the most pathogenic variation from the large dataset of mutations. The machine learning consensus classifier predictor categorized these transcript-level SNPs as the most deleterious variations, resulting in a large decrease in protein structural stability (ΔΔG kcal/mol). The bioactive flavonoid library was screened for drug-likeness and toxicity risk. Virtual screening of eligible flavonoids was performed using the MAPT protein. Identification of druggable protein-binding cavities showed VAL305, GLU655, and LYS657 as consensus-interacting residues present in the MAPT-docked top-ranked flavonoid compounds. The MM/PB(GB)SA analysis indicated hesperetin (-5.64 kcal/mol), eriodictyol (-5.63 kcal/mol), and sakuranetin (-5.60 kcal/mol) as the best docked flavonoids with the near-native binding pose. The findings of this study provide important insights into the potential of hesperetin as a promising flavonoid that can be utilized for further rational drug design and lead optimization to open new gateways in the field of AD therapeutics.\",\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"The structure and function of the brain greatly rely on different signaling pathways. The wide variety of biological processes, including neurogenesis, axonal remodeling, the development and maintenance of pre- and postsynaptic terminals, and excitatory synaptic transmission, depends on combined actions of these molecular pathways. From that point of view, it is important to investigate signaling pathways and their crosstalk in order to better understand the formation of toxic proteins during neurodegeneration. With recent discoveries, it is established that the modulation of several pathological events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Wnt signaling, 5'-adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, silent mating-type information regulator 2 homologue 1) are central to the key findings. These include decreased amyloid formation and inflammation, mitochondrial dynamics control, and enhanced neural stability. This review intends to emphasize the importance of these signaling pathways, which collectively determine the fate of neurons in AD in several ways. This review will also focus on the role of novel synthetic and natural bioactive molecules in balancing the intricate crosstalk among different pathways in order to prolong the longevity of AD patients.\",\n",

This communication is facilitated by rapid signaling through electrical and chemical messengers, including voltage-gated ion channels and neurotransmitters. These messengers elicit broad responses by propagating action potentials and mediating synaptic transmission. Calcium influx and efflux are essential for releasing neurotransmitters and regulating synaptic transmission. Mitochondria, which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and the energy generation process, also interact with the endoplasmic reticulum to store and regulate cytoplasmic calcium levels. The number, morphology, and distribution of mitochondria in different cell types vary based on energy demands. Mitochondrial damage can cause excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Mitophagy is a selective process that targets and degrades damaged mitochondria via autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Defects in mitophagy can lead to a buildup of ROS and cell death. Numerous studies have attempted to characterize the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinocerebellar ataxia, and aging. Interventional strategies to reduce mitochondrial damage and accumulation could serve as a therapeutic target, but further research is needed to unravel this potential. This review offers an overview of calcium signaling related to mitochondria in various neuronal cells. It critically examines recent findings, exploring the potential roles that mitochondrial dysfunction might play in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Furthermore, the review identifies existing gaps in knowledge to guide the direction of future research.\",\n",

Its aberrant expression intricately regulates a wide spectrum of cellular processes, spanning from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, migration, metastasis, and stemness to drug resistance. SOX21-AS1 achieves these effects through its involvement in the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, modulation of downstream genes, and regulation of critical pathways, including PI3K/AKT, Hippo, Wnt/β-catenin, and ERK signaling. Of significant clinical relevance, SOX21-AS1 expression has shown robust correlations with various clinical-pathological features. Moreover, it has demonstrated promising prognostic and diagnostic potential across a spectrum of tumors, as evidenced by existing literature and TCGA pan-cancer analyses. In Alzheimer's disease, SOX21-AS1 assumes a distinctive role. It influences neuronal viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress by interacting with miR-107 and miR-132, and affecting the PI3K/AKT and Wnt signaling pathways. This comprehensive review sheds light on the functions of SOX21-AS1 and the regulated mechanisms underpinning its impact on neoplastic conditions and Alzheimer's disease.

The major active compounds derived from the Synechococcus sp. biomass were identified via pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and 22 compounds were identified in this strain. The most abundant chemical compounds was (E)-octadec-11-enoic acid, with the peak area of 30.6%. Follow by tridecanoic acid, 12-methyl- and hexadecanoic acid, with a peak area of 23.26% and 18.23%, respectively. GC-MS analysis also identified indolizine, isoquinoline, 3,4-dihydro- and Phthalazine, 1-methyl-, as well as alkene and alkane from the strain. After the chemical toxicity test, 10 compounds were finally collected to do the further analysis. Then, network pharmacology and molecular docking were adopted to systematically study the potential anti-AD mechanism of these compounds. Based on the analysis, the 10 Synechococcus-derived active compounds could interact with 128 related anti-AD targets. Among them, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3) were the major targets. Furthermore, the compounds N-capric acid isopropyl ester, (E)-octadec-11-enoic acid, and 2H-Pyran-2,4(3H)-dione, dihydro-6-methyl- obtained higher degrees in the compounds-intersection targets network analysis, indicating these compounds may play more important role in the process of anti-AD. In addition, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that these active compounds exert the anti-AD effects mainly through PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and ras signaling pathway. Our study identified Synechococcus-derived bioactive compounds have the potential for application to AD by targeting multiple targets and related pathways, which will provide a foundation for future research on applications of marine cyanobacteria in the functional drug industry.\",\n",

At the height of the pandemic, major efforts were focused on reducing COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. Now is the time to study the long-term effects of the pandemic, particularly cognitive impairment associated with long COVID. In recent years much attention has been paid to the possible relationship between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease, which is considered a main cause of age-related cognitive impairment. Genetic predisposition was shown for both COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease. However, the analysis of the similarity of the genetic architecture of these diseases is usually limited to indicating a positive genetic correlation between them. In this review, we have described intrinsic linkages between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease, pointed out shared susceptibility genes that were previously identified in genome-wide association studies of both COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease, and highlighted a panel of SNPs that includes candidate genetic risk markers of the long COVID-associated cognitive impairment.\",\n",

Recent studies have provided evidence of a microbiome in the central nervous system. Some have hypothesized that brain-inhabiting organisms induce chronic neuroinflammation, leading to the development of a spectrum of NDs. Bacteria such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, and Cutibacterium acnes have been found to inhabit the brains of ND patients. Furthermore, several fungi, including Candida and Malassezia species, have been identified in the central nervous system of these patients. However, there remains several limitations to the brain microbiome hypothesis. Varying results across the literature, concerns regarding sample contamination, and the presence of exogenous deoxyribonucleic acids have led to doubts about the hypothesis. These results provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of NDs. Herein, we provide a review of the evidence for and against the brain microbiome theory and describe the difficulties facing the hypothesis. Additionally, we define possible mechanisms of bacterial invasion of the brain and organism-related neurodegeneration in NDs and the potential therapeutic premises of this theory.\",\n",

Over a significant period, the widely accepted amyloid cascade hypothesis has guided research efforts, and the recent FDA approval of an anti- amyloid-beta (Aβ) protofibrils antibody, believed to decelerate AD progression, has further solidified its significance. However, the excessive emphasis placed on the amyloid cascade hypothesis has overshadowed the physiological nature of Aβ and tau proteins within axons. Axons, specialized neuronal structures, sustain damage during the early stages of AD, exerting a pivotal influence on disease progression. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the relationship between axonal damage and AD pathology, amalgamating the physiological roles of Aβ and tau proteins, along with the impact of AD risk genes such as APOE and TREM2. Furthermore, we underscore the exceptional significance of axonal damage in the context of AD.\",\n",

Low-density channel electroencephalography (EEG) is frequently used due to its convenience, portability, and affordability, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. Despite extensive research on neural biomarkers for cognitive impairment, there is a considerable gap in understanding the effects on early stages of cognitive processes, particularly when combining physiological and cognitive markers using portable devices.

To address dementia diagnosis, treatment, and care, ADNeT has established three core initiatives: the Clinical Quality Registry (CQR), Memory Clinics, and Screening for Trials. Collectively, the initiatives have developed an integrated clinical and research community, driving practice excellence in this field, leading to novel innovations in diagnostics, clinical care, professional development, quality and harmonization of healthcare, clinical trials, and translation of research into practice. Australia now has a national Registry for Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia with 55 participating clinical sites, an extensive map of memory clinic services, national Memory and Cognition Clinic Guidelines and specialized screening for trials sites in five states. This paper provides an overview of ADNeT's achievements to date and future directions. With the increase in dementia cases expected over coming decades, and with recent advances in plasma biomarkers and amyloid lowering therapies, the nationally coordinated initiatives and partnerships ADNeT has established are critical for increased national prevention efforts, co-ordinated implementation of emerging treatments for Alzheimer's disease, innovation of early and accurate diagnosis, driving continuous improvements in clinical care and patient outcome and access to post-diagnostic support and clinical trials.

With the increase in aged population, there is a prevalence of irreversible neurodegenerative changes, causing a significant mental, social, and economic burden globally. The factors contributing to AD are multidimensional, highly complex, and not completely understood. However, it is widely known that aging, neuroinflammation, and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with other free radicals, substantially contribute to oxidative stress and cell death, which are inextricably linked. While oxidative stress is undeniably important in AD, limiting free radicals and ROS levels is an intriguing and potential strategy for deferring the process of neurodegeneration and alleviating associated symptoms. Therapeutic compounds from natural sources have recently become increasingly accepted and have been effectively studied for AD treatment. These phytocompounds are widely available and a multitude of holistic therapeutic efficiencies for treating AD owing to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and biological activities. Some of these compounds also function by stimulating cholinergic neurotransmission, facilitating the suppression of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1, α-synuclein, and monoamine oxidase proteins, and deterring the occurrence of AD. Additionally, various phenolic, flavonoid, and terpenoid phytocompounds have been extensively described as potential palliative agents for AD progression. Preclinical studies have shown their involvement in modulating the cellular redox balance and minimizing ROS formation, displaying them as antioxidant agents with neuroprotective abilities. This review emphasizes the mechanistic role of natural products in the treatment of AD and discusses the various pathological hypotheses proposed for AD.\",\n",

In the present study, we employed a combination of molecular docking and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (MD) along with experimental approaches to unravel the intricate interactions between transferrin and resveratrol deciphering the binding mechanism. Through molecular docking analysis, it was determined that resveratrol occupies the iron\\xa0binding pocket of transferrin. Furthermore, MD simulations provided a more profound insight into the stability and conformational dynamics of the complex suggesting that the binding of resveratrol introduced localized flexibility, while maintaining overall stability. The spectroscopic observations yielded clear evidence of substantial binding between resveratrol and transferrin, confirming the computational findings. The identified binding mechanism and conformational stability hold potential for advancing the development of innovative therapeutic approaches targeting AD through resveratrol, particularly concerning iron homeostasis.

However, the role of Rlip in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases is not well understood. The purpose of the present study is to determine the role of Rlip in the brains of AD patients and control subjects. To achieve our goals, we used frozen tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded postmortem brains from AD patients of different Braak stages and age-matched control subjects. Our immunohistology and immunoblotting blotting analysis revealed that expression of Rlip protein gradually and significantly decreased (p\\xa0=\\xa00.0001) with AD progression, being lowest in Braak stage IV-V. Rlip was colocalized with Amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) as observed by IHC staining and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Lipid peroxidation (4-HNE generation) and H2O2 production were significantly higher (p\\xa0=\\xa00.004 and 0.0001 respectively) in AD patients compared to controls, and this was accompanied by lower ATP production in AD (p\\xa0=\\xa00.0009). Oxidative DNA damage was measured by 8-Hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in tissue lysates by ELISA and COMET assay. AD 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher (p\\xa0=\\xa00.0001) compared to controls. COMET assay was performed in brain cells, isolated from frozen postmortem samples. The control samples showed minimal DNA in comets representing few DNA strand breaks (<20\\xa0%), (score-0-1). However, the AD group showed an average of 50\\xa0% to 65\\xa0% of DNA in comet tails (score-4-5) indicating numerous DNA strand breaks. The difference between the two groups was significant (p\\xa0=\\xa00.001), as analyzed by Open Comet by ImageJ. Elevated DNA damage was further examined by western blot analysis for phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (γH2AX). Induction of γH2AX was very significant (p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) and confirmed the presence of double-strand breaks in DNA. Overall, our results indicate an important role for Rlip in maintaining neuronal health and homeostasis by suppressing cellular oxidative stress and DNA damage. Based on our findings, we cautiously conclude that Rlip is a promising therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these TMS indices among patients with NAD and healthy controls. Our meta-analyses indicated that TMS neurophysiological examinations revealed decreased glutamatergic function in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and decreased GABAergic function in patients with FTD, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease, cortico-basal syndrome, and multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type.

Accurate early diagnosis of AD is conducive to the prevention and early intervention treatment of AD. Although some computational methods have been developed for AD diagnosis, most employ only neuroimaging, ignoring other data (e.g., genetic, clinical) that may have potential disease information. In addition, the results of some methods lack interpretability. In this work, we proposed a novel method (called DANMLP) of joining dual attention convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for computer-aided AD diagnosis by integrating multi-modality data of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical data (i.e., demographics, neuropsychology), and APOE genetic data. Our DANMLP consists of four primary components: (1) the Patch-CNN for extracting the image characteristics from each local patch, (2) the position self-attention block for capturing the dependencies between features within a patch, (3) the channel self-attention block for capturing dependencies of inter-patch features, (4) two MLP networks for extracting the clinical features and outputting the AD classification results, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the 5CV test, DANMLP achieves 93% and 82.4% classification accuracy for the AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC tasks on the ADNI database, which is 0.2%∼15.2% and 3.4%∼26.8% higher than that of other five methods, respectively. The individualized visualization of focal areas can also help clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD.

Future clinical trials are warranted as Licorice administration has a limiting factor of mild hypertension and hypokalemia. Hopefully, scientific updates on Licorice will propagate a paradigm shift in medicine, research propagation, and development of the central nervous system phytopharmaceuticals.\",\n",

Recent evidence indicates that Aβ and tau proteins can cross-interact to form co-aggregates, which aggravates the development of AD. However, their transient heterooligomer conformations and co-aggregation molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Herein, we utilize replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the conformational ensembles formed by the central hydrophobic core of Aβ (Aβ16-22) and each of two fibril-nucleating core segments of tau (PHF6* and PHF6). Both PHF6 and PHF6* are found to co-aggregate with Aβ16-22 into β-sheet-rich heterooligomers. Intriguingly, PHF6 and Aβ16-22 peptides formed closed β-barrels, while PHF6* and Aβ16-22 formed open β-barrels, implying their distinct co-aggregation property. Compared to Aβ16-22-PHF6*, Aβ16-22-PHF6 heterooligomers have higher β-sheet content, and contain longer β-strands and larger β-sheets, indicative of stronger co-aggregation ability of PHF6 with Aβ16-22. Further analyses reveal that hydrophobic and π-π stacking interactions between Y310 of PHF6 and Aβ16-22 are crucial for the closed β-barrel/larger β-sheet formation in Aβ16-22-PHF6 heterooligomers. These results highlight the paramount importance of PHF6 fragment, particularly Y310 residue, as a potential target for inhibiting Aβ-tau co-aggregation, which could help for effective therapeutic design in mitigating Aβ-tau co-aggregation related amyloidogenesis.\",\n",

There is great potential for natural products to be used in the development of anti-AD drugs. P-coumaric acid (PCA), a small molecule phenolic acid widely distributed in the plant kingdom, has pharmacological effects such as neuroprotection, but its anti-AD mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism of PCA intervention in the Aβ25-35-induced AD model using gut microbiomics and serum metabolomics combined with in vitro and in vivo pharmacological experiments. PCA was found to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction and neuronal cell damage in Aβ25-35-injected mice as measured by behavioral, pathological and biochemical indicators. 16S rDNA sequencing and serum metabolomics showed that PCA reduced the abundance of pro-inflammatory-associated microbiota (morganella, holdemanella, fusicatenibacter and serratia) in the gut, which were closely associated with metabolites of the glucose metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, tyrosine metabolism and phospholipid metabolism pathways in serum. Next, in vivo and in vitro pharmacological investigations revealed that PCA regulated Aβ25-35-induced disruption of glucose metabolism through activation of PI3K/AKT/Glut1 signaling. Additionally, PCA ameliorated Aβ25-35-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-κB and by modulating upstream MAPK signaling. In conclusion, PCA ameliorated cognitive deficits in Aβ25-35-induced AD mice by regulating glucose metabolism and neuroinflammation, and the mechanism is related not only to restoring homeostasis of gut microbiota and serum metabolites, but also to PI3K/AKT/Glut1 and MAPK/NF-κB signaling.\",\n",

It has been widely used for its anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects. It is commonly used for its cardiovascular benefits and is prescribed as secondary prophylaxis after a heart attack. Furthermore, low-dose, long-term ASA is used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in individuals without prior cardiovascular disease. Acetylsalicylic acid acts as a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX), which inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins and prevents pro-inflammatory cytokines. Findings suggest that targeting cytokines and growth factors could be a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing neuroinflammation and slowing down the progression of dementia. Additionally, prostaglandins contribute to synaptic plasticity and can act as retrograde messengers in synapses. Research has implicated COX-1, one of the isoforms of the enzyme, in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders. The inhibition of COX-1 might potentially prevent impairments in working memory and reduce neuroinflammation caused by beta-amyloid proteins in some conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cyclooxygenase-2, an inducible form of the enzyme, is expressed in cortical and hippocampal neurons and is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. The inhibition or knockout of COX-2 has been shown to decrease long-term potentiation, a process involved in memory formation. Studies have also demonstrated that the administration of COX-2 inhibitors impairs cognitive function and memory acquisition and recall in animal models. There remains a debate regarding the effects of aspirin on dementia and cognitive decline. Although some studies suggest a possible protective effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, against the development of AD, others have shown inconsistent evidence. This review provides an overview of the effects of ASA or its active metabolite salicylate on learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity.\",\n",

Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, has been associated with mutations in TREM2, which is also responsible for raising the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we have made an endeavour to differentiate the confirmed pathogenic variants in TREM2 extra-cellular domain (ECD) linked with NHD and AD using mutation-induced fold stability change (∆∆G), with the computation of 12distinct structure-based methods through saturation mutagenesis. Correlation analysis between relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and ∆∆G expresses the discrete distributive behaviour of mutants associated with TREM2 in AD (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.061) and NHD (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.601).

This Y108 could have structural or functional role for TREM2 which can be an ideal candidate for further study. Furthermore, the residual interaction network highlights the importance of R47 and R62 in maintaining the CDR loops that are crucial for ligand binding.

A modest difference in expression profiles between EOAD patients and non-demented control (NDC) subjects resulted in a limited number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

PD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder after AD, and is associated with the loss of dopaminergic signaling, which causes motor and nonmotor signs and symptoms. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are common pathological hallmarks of PD that are mainly composed of aggregates of disordered α-synuclein (α-Syn). There have been many efforts to develop chemical compounds to prevent aggregation or facilitate disruption of the aggregates. Furthermore, the roles and interactions of many compounds have yet to be revealed at the atomistic level, especially their impacts on the dynamics and chain-chain interactions of the oligomers, which are of interest in this study. The conformational diversity and detailed interactions among homo-oligomer chains of α-Syn are not fully discovered; identifying these might help uncover a practical approach to developing a potent therapy. In this study, we used an in-silico investigation to address the conformational diversity of α-Syn oligomer. The roles of several point mutations in protein aggregation in PD are known; we take this further by evaluating the interaction energies and contributions of all residues in stability and residue-chain interactions. In this study, we docked chemical derivatives of three compounds with high drug-likeness properties to evaluate the roles of our ligands in the conformational dynamicity of the oligomers, with emphasis on intramolecular forces. Free energy evaluation of the modeled inter and intramolecular interactions through MD simulation shows effective interaction and binding between α-Syn and our compounds. However, we find that they do not significantly disrupt the chain-chain interactions, compared to unliganded simulation.\",\n",

When compared with healthy controls (HC), AD showed primarily stronger delta-alpha cross-couplings and weaker theta-sigma cross-couplings. Notably, when comparing the AD and FTD groups, we found that the AD exhibited stronger delta-alpha and delta-beta connectivity than the FTD. Thereafter, by extracting the representative network features and then applying these features in the classification between AD and FTD, an accuracy of 81.1% was achieved. Finally, a multivariable linear regressive model was built, based on the differential topologies, and then adopted to predict the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale. Accordingly, the predicted and actual measured scores were indeed significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.274, p = 0.036).

Our previous study reported that aggregation is strikingly elevated in hearts of hypertensive and aged mice; however, no prior study has addressed MI effects on aggregation in heart or brain. Here, we present novel data on heart and brain aggregation in mice following experimental MI, induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation. Infarcted and peri-infarcted heart tissue, and whole cerebra, were isolated from mice at sacrifice, 7 days following LCA ligation. Sham-MI mice (identical surgery without ligation) served as controls. We purified detergent-insoluble aggregates from these tissues, and quantified key protein constituents by high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Infarct heart tissue had 2.5- to 10-fold more aggregates than non-infarct or sham-MI heart tissue (each P\\u2009=\\u20090.001).

However, the ephemeral nature of nucleation has made this goal unachievable with existing biochemistry, structural biology, and computational approaches. Here, we addressed that limitation for polyglutamine (polyQ), a polypeptide sequence that causes Huntington's and other amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases when its length exceeds a characteristic threshold. To identify essential features of the polyQ amyloid nucleus, we used a direct intracellular reporter of self-association to quantify frequencies of amyloid appearance as a function of concentration, conformational templates, and rational polyQ sequence permutations. We found that nucleation of pathologically expanded polyQ involves segments of three glutamine (Q) residues at every other position. We demonstrate using molecular simulations that this pattern encodes a four-stranded steric zipper with interdigitated Q side chains. Once formed, the zipper poisoned its own growth by engaging naive polypeptides on orthogonal faces, in a fashion characteristic of polymer crystals with intramolecular nuclei. We further show that self-poisoning can be exploited to block amyloid formation, by genetically oligomerizing polyQ prior to nucleation.

Once the process starts, amyloids will continue to form, leading to worse symptoms that cannot be cured. The best way to treat these diseases is therefore to stop amyloids from arising in the first place. Amyloids initially develop by proteins coming together to create an unstable structure referred to as the nucleus. The instability of the nucleus means it cannot be observed directly, making it hard to study this nucleation process. To overcome this, Kandola, Venkatesan et al. investigated the simplest protein known to form an amyloid – polyglutamine, which is made up of a chain of repeating building blocks known as amino acids. Polyglutamine forms only one type of amyloid which is associated with nine neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s disease. However, it only does this when its chain of amino acids exceeds a certain length, suggesting that a specific structure may be required for nucleation to begin. Kandola, Venkatesan et al. made alternative versions of the polyglutamine protein which each contained slightly different sequences of amino acids that will alter the way the protein folds. They then tested how well these different variants could form amyloids in yeast cells. This revealed that in order to join together into a nucleus, polyglutamine needs to be able to fold into a zipper shape made up of four interlocking strands. The length of the protein required to form this shape is also the same length that causes the amyloid associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Kandola, Venkatesan et al. also found that polyglutamine tends to bind to nuclei that have already formed in a way that hinders their growth. This ‘self-poisoning’ affect could potentially be exploited as a way to pre-emptively stop amyloids from initially arising. These findings have uncovered a potential therapeutic strategy for blocking amyloid formation that could eventually benefit people with or at risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases linked to polyglutamine. Additionally, this approach provides a blueprint for understanding how other proteins undergo amyloid nucleation, including those responsible for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other diseases.',\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"This paper aims to establish a coupling model of neuronal populations and astrocytes and, on this basis, explore the possible mechanism of electroencephalography (EEG) slowing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the viewpoint of dynamical modeling. First and foremost, excitatory and inhibitory time constants are shown to induce the early symptoms of AD. The corresponding dynamic nature is mainly due to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the oscillatory behavior. However, there are also a few cases that can be attributed to the change of the oscillation mode caused by the limit cycle bifurcation and birhythmicity. Then, an improved neural mass model influenced by astrocytes is proposed, considering the important effects of glutamate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by astrocytes on the synaptic transmission process reported in experiments. The results show that a dysfunctional astrocyte disrupts the physiological state, causing three typical EEG slowing phenomena reported clinically: the decreased dominant frequency, the decreased rhythmic activity in the α band, and the increased rhythmic activity in the δ+θ band. In addition, astrocytes may control AD when the effect of ATP on synaptic connections is greater than that of glutamate. The control rate depends on the ratio of the effect of glutamate on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. These modeling results can not only reproduce some experimental and clinical results, but, more importantly, may offer a prediction of some underlying phenomena, helping to inspire the disease mechanisms and therapeutic methods of targeting astrocytes.\",\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease where abnormal amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) occurs and has been linked to neuronal dysfunction. Hypometabolism of glucose in the brain can lead to synaptic loss and neuronal death, which in turn exacerbates energy deficiency and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) accumulation. Lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis serves as an energy substrate supporting neuronal function and facilitating neuronal repair. Vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4) has been recognized as a key regulator of the hypoxia-sensing pathway. However, the role of VGLL4 in AD remains unexplored. Here, we reported that the expression of VGLL4 protein was significantly decreased in the brain tissue of AD model mice and AD model cells. We further found that overexpression of VGLL4 reduced APP amyloidogenic processing and ameliorated neuronal synaptic damage. Notably, we identified a compromised hypoxia-sensitive capability of LDHA regulated by VGLL4 in the context of AD. Upregulation of VGLL4 increased the response of LDHA to hypoxia and enhanced the expression levels of LDHA and lactate by inhibiting the ubiquitination and degradation of LDHA. Furthermore, the inhibition of lactate production by using sodium oxamate, an inhibitor of LDHA, suppressed the neuroprotective function of VGLL4 by increasing APP amyloidogenic processing. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that VGLL4 exerts a neuroprotective effect by upregulating LDHA expression and consequently promoting lactate production. Thus, this study suggests that VGLL4 may be a novel player involved in molecular mechanisms relevant for ameliorating neurodegeneration.\",\n",

However, evidence that cells exploit these structures to control function and activity of some proteins in response to stimuli has questioned this paradigm. How amyloid-like assembly can confer emergent functions and how cells couple assembly with environmental conditions remains unclear. Here, we study Rim4, an RNA-binding protein that forms translation-repressing assemblies during yeast meiosis. We demonstrate that in its assembled and repressive state, Rim4 binds RNA more efficiently than in its monomeric and idle state, revealing a causal connection between assembly and function. The Rim4-binding site location within the transcript dictates whether the assemblies can repress translation, underscoring the importance of the architecture of this RNA-protein structure for function. Rim4 assembly depends exclusively on its intrinsically disordered region and is prevented by the Ras/protein kinase A signaling pathway, which promotes growth and suppresses meiotic entry in yeast. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby cells couple a functional protein assembly with a stimulus to enforce a cell fate decision.',\n",

Semi-structured interviews were conducted between January and March 2020 with six people living with dementia and 15 family carers. Inductive and deductive techniques were used. The latter was informed by Link and Phelan's (2001) sociological theory of stigma. Dementia was commonly viewed by people living with dementia as part of ageing and carers reported low levels awareness about the condition. To avoid negative reactions from people, people living with dementia managed the negative views of dementia by minimising and normalising the condition, by expressing their ability to live an active life, and by emphasising the positive impacts of dementia in their lives. Fear of negative reactions appeared to lead to a selective disclosure of their diagnosis. Among carers, stigmatising attitudes coincided with a strong willingness to provide good care, to protect the person cared for, as well as to understand and validate their caring experiences, rather than to cause harm. In doing so, however, carers ended up depersonalising and infantilising people living with dementia, underestimating their capacities, demanding 'obedience', and restricting their freedom.

The occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease involves many processes. In response to the complex pathogenesis of AD, the Traditional Chinese medicine formula Liuwei Dihuang Pill (LWD) has been shown to improve the cognitive function of AD animal models. However, the active ingredients and mechanism of action of LWD have not been fully elucidated. In this study, network pharmacological analysis predicted 40 candidate compounds in LWD, acting on 227 potential targets, of which 185 were associated with AD. Through network pharmacological analysis, the mechanism of action of LWD therapy AD is related to the inhibition of inflammatory response, regulation of neuronal state, and autophagy. In this experiment, LWD was detected in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model. The objective was to observe the effects of LWD on hippocampal learning and memory ability, Aβ clearance, autophagy and inflammatory response in APP/PS1 mice. The results showed that LWD improved long-term memory and working memory in APP/PS1 mice compared with the WT group. At the same time, LWD can increase the expression of hippocampal autophagy biomarkers, reduce the precipitation of Aβ, and the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Its mechanism may be related to the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that LWD has a neuroprotective effect on APP/PS1 mice and provide theoretical foundation for the development of a new clinical treatment for AD.\",\n",

Because AD patients will have cognitive impairment and personality changes, it has caused a heavy burden on the family and society.

Based on the structural magnetic resonance imaging data and transcriptome data of AD and healthy control samples in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Disease database, this paper proposed the use of an orthogonal structured sparse canonical correlation analysis for diagnostic information fusion algorithm. The algorithm added structural constraints to the region of interest (ROI) of the brain. Integrating the diagnostic information of samples can improve the correlation performance between samples. The results showed that the algorithm could extract the correlation between the two modal data and discovered the brain regions most affected by multiple risk genes and their biological significance.

STZ worsened spatial memory in the YMT, as well as short-term (STM) and long-term (LTM) memories in the ORT and ODT, respectively. EXE-4 protected against memory impairment in STZ animals. STZ reduced mature neuron density (NeuN) and increased cell apoptosis (CC3) in the DG, CA1, and CA3. EXE-4 protected against neuronal death in all regions. EXE-4 increased PCNA+ cells in all regions of the hippocampus, and STZ attenuated this effect. STZ reduced neurogenesis in DG per se as well as synaptogenesis induced by EXE-4. EXE-4 increased immunoreactivity to IR in the CA1. From these findings, EXE-4 showed a beneficial effect on hippocampal pyramidal and granular neurons in the SDAT showing anti-apoptotic properties and promoting cell proliferation.

However, how hyperphosphorylated tau causes cellular dysfunction or death that underlies neurodegeneration remains an unsolved question critical for the understanding of disease mechanism and the design of efficacious drugs. Using a recombinant hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) synthesized by the PIMAX approach, we examined how cells responded to the cytotoxic tau and explored means to enhance cellular resistance to tau attack. Upon p-tau uptake, the intracellular calcium levels rose promptly. Gene expression analyses revealed that p-tau potently triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress-associated apoptosis, and pro-inflammation in cells. Proteomics studies showed that p-tau diminished heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an ER stress-associated anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress regulator, while stimulated the accumulation of MIOS and other proteins. p-Tau-induced ER stress-associated apoptosis and pro-inflammation are ameliorated by apomorphine, a brain-permeable prescription drug widely used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, and by overexpression of HO-1. Our results reveal probable cellular functions targeted by hyperphosphorylated tau. Some of these dysfunctions and stress responses have been linked to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The observations that the ill effects of p-tau can be mitigated by a small compound and by overexpressing HO-1 that is otherwise diminished in the treated cells inform new directions of Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.\",\n",

Here, we describe a neural circuit mechanism underlying this resilience in a familial AD mouse model. In the prodromal disease stage, interictal epileptiform spikes (IESs) emerge during anesthesia in the CA1 and mPFC regions, leading to working memory disruptions. These IESs are driven by inputs from the thalamic nucleus reuniens (nRE). Indeed, tonic deep brain stimulation of the nRE (tDBS-nRE) effectively suppresses IESs and restores firing rate homeostasis under anesthesia, preventing further impairments in nRE-CA1 synaptic facilitation and working memory. Notably, applying tDBS-nRE during the prodromal phase in young APP/PS1 mice mitigates age-dependent memory decline. The IES rate during anesthesia in young APP/PS1 mice correlates with later working memory impairments. These findings highlight the nRE as a central hub of functional resilience and underscore the clinical promise of DBS in conferring resilience to AD pathology by restoring circuit-level homeostasis.\",\n",

Here we describe an integrated neurodegeneration checkpoint response to early pathological changes that restricts further disease progression and preserves cognitive function. Checkpoint activation is mediated by the REST transcriptional repressor, which is induced in cognitively-intact aging humans and AD mouse models at the onset of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) deposition and tau accumulation. REST induction is mediated by the unfolded protein response together with β-catenin signaling. A consequence of this response is the targeting of REST to genes involved in key pathogenic pathways, resulting in downregulation of gamma secretase, tau kinases, and pro-apoptotic proteins. Deletion of REST in the 3xTg and J20 AD mouse models accelerates Aβ deposition and the accumulation of misfolded and phosphorylated tau, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Conversely, viral-mediated overexpression of REST in the hippocampus suppresses Aβ and tau pathology. Thus, REST mediates a neurodegeneration checkpoint response with multiple molecular targets that may\\xa0protect against the onset of AD.\",\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"The presence of protein aggregates is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Traditionally, each disease has been associated with the aggregation of specific proteins, which serve as disease-specific biomarkers. For example, aggregates of α-synuclein (α-syn) are found in α-synucleinopathies such as PD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Similarly, AD is characterized by aggregates of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins. However, it has been observed that these protein aggregates can also occur in other neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to disease progression. For instance, α-syn aggregates have been detected in AD, Down syndrome, Huntington's disease, prion diseases, and various forms of FTLD. Similarly, Aβ aggregates have been found in conditions like DLB and PD. Tau aggregates, in addition to being present in primary tauopathies, have been identified in prion diseases, α-synucleinopathies, and cognitively healthy aged subjects. Finally, aggregates of TDP-43, typically associated with FTLD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have been observed in AD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), MSA, DLB, and other neurodegenerative diseases. These findings highlight the complexity of protein aggregation in neurodegeneration and suggest potential interactions and common mechanisms underlying different diseases. A deeper understating of this complex scenario may eventually lead to the identification of a better elucidation of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these devastating conditions and hopefully new therapeutic stragegies.\",\n",

Methods: We analyzed [18F]PI-2620 PET data from 65 patients with clinical diagnoses associated with AD or FTLD neuropathology; most (60/65) also had amyloid-β (Aβ) PET. Scans were acquired 30-60\\u2009min after injection; SUVr maps (reference, inferior cerebellar cortex) were created for the full acquisition and for 10-min truncated sliding windows (30-40, 35-45,…50-60\\u2009min). Age- and sex-adjusted z score maps were computed for each patient, relative to 23 Aβ-negative cognitively healthy controls (HC). Mean SUVr in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nuclei, dentate nuclei, white matter, and temporal gray matter was extracted for the full and truncated windows. Results: Patients with suspected AD neuropathology (Aβ-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia) showed high-intensity temporoparietal cortex-predominant [18F]PI-2620 binding. At the group level, patients with clinical diagnoses associated with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome [PSP Richardson syndrome], corticobasal syndrome, and nonfluent-variant primary progressive aphasia) exhibited higher globus pallidus SUVr than did HCs; pallidal retention was highest in the PSP Richardson syndrome group, in whom SUVr was correlated with symptom severity (ρ = 0.53, P = 0.05). At the individual level, only half of PSP Richardson syndrome, corticobasal syndrome, and nonfluent-variant primary progressive aphasia patients had a pallidal SUVr above that of HCs. Temporal SUVr discriminated AD patients from HCs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.83-1.00]) for all time windows, whereas discrimination between patients with PSP Richardson syndrome and HCs using pallidal SUVr was fair regardless of time window (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61-0.92] at 30-40\\u2009min vs. 0.81 [95% CI, 0.66-0.96] at 50-60\\u2009min; P = 0.67). Conclusion: [18F]PI-2620 SUVr shows an intense and consistent signal in AD but lower-intensity, heterogeneous, and rapidly decreasing binding in patients with suspected FTLD. Further work is needed to delineate the substrate of [18F]PI-2620 binding and the usefulness of [18F]PI2620 SUVr quantification outside the AD continuum.\",\n",

Following β- and γ-secretase-mediated RIP, the released APP intracellular domain (AICD) together with Fe65 can translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription. In this study, we investigated if Fe65 nuclear localization can also be regulated by different α-secretases, also known to participate in RIP of APP and other transmembrane proteins. We found that in both Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and all-trans retinoic acid differentiated neuroblastoma cells a strong negative impact on Fe65 nuclear localization, equal to the effect observed upon γ-secretase inhibition, could be detected following inhibition of all three (ADAM9, ADAM10 and ADAM17) α-secretases. Moreover, using the comet assay and analysis of Fe65 dependent DNA repair associated posttranslational modifications of histones, we could show that inhibition of α-secretase-mediated Fe65 nuclear translocation resulted in impaired capacity of the cells to repair DNA damage. Taken together this suggests that α-secretase processing of APP and/or other Fe65 interacting transmembrane proteins play an important role in regulating Fe65 nuclear translocation and DNA repair.',\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"Maintaining the proteome is crucial to retaining cell functionality and response to multiple intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. Protein misfolding increased the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated the adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore cell homeostasis. Apoptosis occurs when ER stress is prolonged or the adaptive response fails. In healthy young cells, the ratio of protein folding machinery to quantities of misfolded proteins is balanced under normal circumstances. However, the age-related deterioration of the complex systems for handling protein misfolding is accompanied by ageing-related disruption of protein homeostasis, which results in the build-up of misfolded and aggregated proteins. This ultimately results in decreased cell viability and forms the basis of common age-related diseases called protein misfolding diseases. Proteins or protein fragments convert from their ordinarily soluble forms to insoluble fibrils or plaques in many of these disorders, which build up in various organs such as the liver, brain, or spleen. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type II diabetes, and cancer are diseases in this group commonly manifest in later life. Thus, protein misfolding and its prevention by chaperones and different degradation paths are becoming understood from molecular perspectives. Proteodynamics information will likely affect future interventional techniques to combat cellular stress and support healthy ageing by avoiding and treating protein conformational disorders. This review provides an overview of the diverse proteostasis machinery, protein misfolding, and ER stress involvement, which activates the UPR sensors. Here, we will discuss the crosstalk between protein misfolding and ER stress and their role in developing age-related diseases.\",\n",

While the U-fibers play a crucial role in various brain disorders, there is a lack of effective tools to reconstruct their highly curved trajectory from diffusion MRI (dMRI). In this work, we propose a novel surface-based framework for the probabilistic tracking of fibers on the triangular mesh representation of the SWM. By deriving a closed-form solution to transform the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients of 3D fiber orientation distributions (FODs) to local coordinate systems on each triangle, we develop a novel approach to project the FODs onto the tangent space of the SWM. After that, we utilize parallel transport to realize the intrinsic propagation of streamlines on SWM following probabilistically sampled fiber directions. Our intrinsic and surface-based method eliminates the need to perform the necessary but challenging sharp turns in 3D compared with conventional volume-based tractography methods. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we performed quantitative comparisons to demonstrate the proposed algorithm can more effectively reconstruct the U-fibers connecting the precentral and postcentral gyrus than previous methods. Quantitative validations were then performed on post-mortem MRIs to show the reconstructed U-fibers from our method more faithfully follow the SWM than volume-based tractography. Finally, we applied our algorithm to study the parietal U-fiber connectivity changes in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) patients and successfully detected significant associations between U-fiber connectivity and disease severity.\",\n",

These changes correlate with brain amyloid deposition as determined by histological quantification,\\xa0positron emission tomography (PET) or clinical diagnosis of AD.

       "  'AbstractText': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia associated with amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. Dysfunction of the neuronal clearance pathway promotes the accumulation of Aβ. The plasminogen-activating system (PAS) is controlled by various enzymes like tissue plasminogen activators (tPA). Neuronal tPA enhances the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which cleaves Aβ; this function is controlled by many inhibitors of PAS, including a plasminogen-activating inhibitor (PAI-1) and neuroserpin. Therefore, the objective of the present narrative review was to explore the potential role of tPA/neuroserpin in the pathogenesis of AD. PAI-1 activity is increased in AD, which is involved in accumulating Aβ. Progressive increase of Aβ level during AD neuropathology is correlated with the over-production of PAI-1 with subsequent reduction of plasmin and tPA activities. Reducing plasmin and tPA activities promote Aβ by reducing Aβ clearance. Neuroserpin plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD as it regulates the expression and accumulation of Aβ. Higher expression of neuroserpin inhibits the neuroprotective tPA and the generation of plasmin with subsequent reduction in the clearance of Aβ. These observations raise conflicting evidence on whether neuroserpin is neuroprotective or involved in AD progression. Thus, neuroserpin over-expression with subsequent reduction of tPA may propagate AD neuropathology.\",\n",

We report that raised intracranial pressure and diminished CSF flow in craniosynostosis mouse models associates with pathological changes to meningeal lymphatic vessels that affect their sprouting, expansion, and long-term maintenance. We also show that craniosynostosis affects CSF circulatory pathways and perfusion into the brain. Further, craniosynostosis exacerbates amyloid pathology and plaque buildup in Twist1+/-:5xFAD transgenic Alzheimer's disease models. Treating craniosynostosis mice with Yoda1, a small molecule agonist for Piezo1, reduces intracranial pressure and improves CSF flow, in addition to restoring meningeal lymphangiogenesis, drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes, and brain-CSF perfusion. Leveraging these findings, we show Yoda1 treatments in aged mice with reduced CSF flow and turnover improve lymphatic networks, drainage, and brain-CSF perfusion. Our results suggest CSF provides mechanical force to facilitate meningeal lymphatic growth and maintenance. Additionally, applying Yoda1 agonist in conditions with raised intracranial pressure and/or diminished CSF flow, as seen in craniosynostosis or with ageing, is a possible therapeutic option to help restore meningeal lymphatic networks and brain-CSF perfusion.\",\n",

Six studies fulfilling the selection criteria were included in this systematic review. Four of the studies were of cohort design and two were of case-control design. All except one showed a significant association between PD and the risk of AD onset and progression. According to the NOS bias risk assessment, three studies were found to be of good quality, and three other cohort studies were of low quality. Data from this systematic review indicate that patients with PD present a significantly higher risk of AD compared to individuals with healthy periodontium.

Autophagy is strongly associated with the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are brain-resident macrophages, and recent studies indicate that autophagy in microglia protects neurons from neurodegeneration. Postnatal neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons from adult neural stem cells (NSCs), is impaired in AD patients as well as in AD animal models. However, the extent to which microglial autophagy influences adult NSCs and neurogenesis in AD animal models has not been studied. Here, we showed that conditional knock out (cKO) of Atg5 (autophagy related 5) in microglia inhibited postnatal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, but not in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of a 5×FAD mouse model. Interestingly, the protection of neurogenesis by Atg5 in microglia was only observed in female AD mice. To confirm the roles of autophagy in microglia for postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, we generated additional cKO mice to delete autophagy essential genes Rb1cc1 or Atg14 in microglia. However, these rb1cc1 cKO and atg14 cKO mice did not exhibit neurogenesis defects in the context of a female AD mouse model. Last, we used the CSF1R antagonist to deplete ATG5-deficient microglia and this intervention restored neurogenesis in the hippocampus of 5×FAD mice. These results indicate that microglial ATG5 is essential to maintain postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD. Our findings further support the notion that ATG5 in microglia supports NSC health and may prevent neurodegeneration.',\n",

We recently developed autophagy-targeting chimera (AUTOTAC), a targeted protein degradation (TPD) technology based on the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). In this study, we employed AUTOTAC to synthesize ATC161, a chimeric compound that adopts Anle138b as target-binding ligand (TBL) for SNCA aggregates. The autophagy-targeting ligand (ATL) of ATC161 was designed to allosterically activate the autophagy receptor SQSTSM1/p62 (sequestosome 1), a key step for targeting SNCA aggregates to the phagophore. The lysosomal degradation of SNCA aggregates by ATC161 acutely occurs at DC50 of 100-500\\u2009nM with no significant off-target degradation of monomeric SNCA. ATC161 protects cells from DNA and mitochondrial damage by SNCA aggregates. In PD model mice, oral administration of ATC161 decreases the level of SNCA aggregates and their propagation across brain regions, which mitigates glial inflammatory responses and improves muscle strength and locomotive activity. An Investigational New Drug (IND) was approved by the Korean Food and Drug Administration for a phase 1 clinical trial to treat PD, Alzheimer disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Eleven studies with 12 trials including 451 cases were included in our systemic review, in which 9 studies with 10 trials using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scales were included in the meta-analysis. tDCS significantly improved global cognition in AD immediately after the treatment (SMD, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.66; P<0.0001), but not at the shorter or longer follow-up period. Subgroup analyses suggested significant global cognitive improvement in patients receiving stimulation on temporal lobes instead of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and in cases receiving tDCS with current density\\u2009≥\\u20090.08 mA/cm2 rather than <0.08 mA/cm2.

The structural requirements of such plasticity and molecular events involved in this regulation are poorly understood. Specific molecules, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) have been implicated in plasticity\\xa0processes in the hippocampus, a role that decreases with brain aging as expression is lost. Here, we report that TIMP2 is highly expressed by neurons within the hippocampus and its loss drives changes in cellular programs related to adult neurogenesis and dendritic spine turnover with corresponding impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory. Consistent with the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the hippocampus we observe with aging, we find that TIMP2 acts to reduce accumulation of ECM around synapses in the hippocampus. Moreover, its deletion results in hindrance of newborn neuron migration through a denser ECM network. A novel conditional TIMP2 knockout (KO) model reveals that neuronal TIMP2 regulates adult neurogenesis, accumulation of ECM, and ultimately hippocampus-dependent memory. Our results define a mechanism whereby hippocampus-dependent function is regulated by TIMP2 and its interactions with the ECM to regulate diverse processes associated with synaptic plasticity.',\n",

Recently, the active compound SPA1413 (dehydroequol) derived from S-equol, an isoflavone-derived metabolite produced by human intestinal bacteria, was identified as a potent anti-amyloidogenic and neuroinflammatory candidate against Alzheimer's disease. However, its detailed modes of action, associated signaling pathways, and comparison with potential isoflavone derivatives have not yet been studied. Hence, the current study aimed to identify signaling pathways associated with SPA1413 using lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated BV2 cells as the experimental model via biological assays, Western blotting, and quantitative (q)RT-PCR. The results indicate that the SPA1413 anti-neuroinflammatory effect arises due to suppression of the nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling networks, including those of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Interestingly, SPA1413 inhibited IL-11 through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. In addition, SPA1413 inhibited neuronal cell death by reducing LPS-activated microglia in neuronal N2a cells. Our findings suggest that SPA1413 may act as a strong anti-neuroinflammatory candidate by suppressing the MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways.\",\n",

Its efficacy has been shown in protecting neural cells in vitro and improving the morphology of the cell population in the brain of mice with AD pathology (AD mice). Matrine (Mat) is a natural product capable of binding to Aβ42 or its aggregates and blocking their neurotoxicity at concentrations of at least 10\\xa0μM or greater. However, this study revealed a synergistic effect of Mat on the catalytic effect of HS72 at low concentrations (0.01-2.5\\xa0μM).

The study's results suggest a natural synergy between Mat-like small molecules and the catalytic anti-oligomeric Aβ42 antibody HS72, enabling more effective reduction or removal of Aβ42 aggregates or plaques than the antibody alone.

Hesperidin, a flavone glycoside found primarily in citrus species, is known to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of hesperidin as an antiaging and anti-Aβ phytochemical were unclear. In this study, we found that hesperidin upregulates the acr-16 expression level in C. elegans as evidenced by increased GFP-tagged ACR-16 and GFP-tagged pmyo-3:ACR-16 expression in muscle and ventral cord. Further, hesperidin upregulates the autophagy genes in wild-type N2, evident by increased GFP-tagged LGG-1 foci. However, hesperidin failed to upregulate the autophagy genes level in acr-16 mutant worms that suggests autophagy activation is mediated through acr-16. In addition, hesperidin showed antiaging and anti-oxidative effects, as evidenced by positive changes in different markers necessary for health span and lifespan. Additionally, hesperidin could upregulate acr-16 and autophagy genes (lgg-1 & bec-1) and ameliorates Aβ-induced toxicity as observed with reduce ROS accumulation, paralysis rate, and enhanced lifespan even in worms AD model CL4176 and CL2006 strain.

The hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory, but most rodent single unit studies require spatial exploration or active engagement. Hence, we investigated neural responses to a silent movie (Allen Brain Observatory) in head-fixed mice without any task or locomotion demands, or rewards. Surprisingly, a third (33%, 3379/10263) of hippocampal -dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1 and subiculum- neurons showed movie-selectivity, with elevated firing in specific movie sub-segments, termed movie-fields, similar to the vast majority of thalamo-cortical (LGN, V1, AM-PM) neurons (97%, 6554/6785). Movie-tuning remained intact in immobile or spontaneously running mice. Visual neurons had >5 movie-fields per cell, but only ~2 in hippocampus. The movie-field durations in all brain regions spanned an unprecedented 1000-fold range: from 0.02s to 20s, termed mega-scale coding. Yet, the total duration of all the movie-fields of a cell was comparable across neurons and brain regions. The hippocampal responses thus showed greater continuous-sequence encoding than visual areas, as evidenced by fewer and broader movie-fields than in visual areas. Consistently, repeated presentation of the movie images in a fixed, but scrambled sequence virtually abolished hippocampal but not visual-cortical selectivity. The preference for continuous, compared to scrambled sequence was eight-fold greater in hippocampal than visual areas, further supporting episodic-sequence encoding. Movies could thus provide a unified way to probe neural mechanisms of episodic information processing and memory, even in immobile subjects, across brain regions, and species.',\n",

This neurodegenerative disease is characterized by progressive and irreversible damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerves, which can lead to permanent loss of peripheral and central vision. To date, maintaining long-term survival of RGCs using traditional treatments, such as medication and surgery, remains challenging, as these do not promote optic nerve regeneration. Therefore, it is of great clinical and social significance to investigate the mechanisms of optic nerve degeneration in depth and find reliable targets to provide pioneering methods for the prevention and treatment of glaucoma. Regulated necrosis is a form of genetically programmed cell death associated with the maintenance of homeostasis and disease progression in vivo. An increasing body of innovative evidence has recognized that aberrant activation of regulated necrosis pathways is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and glaucoma, resulting in unwanted loss of neuronal cells and function. Among them, ferroptosis and pyroptosis are newly discovered forms of regulated cell death actively involved in the pathophysiological processes of RGCs loss and optic nerve injury. This was shown by a series of in vivo and in vitro studies, and these mechanisms have been emerging as a key new area of scientific research in ophthalmic diseases. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and pyroptosis and their regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, with the aim of exploring their implications as potential therapeutic targets and providing new perspectives for better clinical decision-making in glaucoma treatment.\",\n",

As a result, highly toxic protein aggregates, which are known as amyloid fibrils, are formed. A growing body of evidence suggests that phospholipids can uniquely alter the secondary structure and toxicity of amyloid aggregates. However, the role of phosphatidic acid (PA), a unique lipid that is responsible for cell signaling and activation of lipid-gated ion channels, in the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of the length and degree of unsaturation of fatty acids (FAs) in PA in the structure and toxicity of lysozyme fibrils formed in the presence of this lipid. We found that both the length and saturation of FAs in PA uniquely altered the secondary structure of lysozyme fibrils. However, these structural differences in PA caused very little if any changes in the morphology of lysozyme fibrils. We also utilized cell toxicity assays to determine the extent to which the length and degree of unsaturation of FAs in PA altered the toxicity of lysozyme fibrils. We found that amyloid fibrils formed in the presence of PA with C18:0 FAs exerted significantly higher cell toxicity compared to the aggregates formed in the presence of PA with C16:0 and C18:1 FAs. These results demonstrated that PA can be an important player in the onset and spread of amyloidogenic diseases.\",\n",

Despite this importance there is a lack of treatment options. Proliferation of microglia producing an expanded, reactive population and associated neuroinflammatory alterations have been implicated in the onset and progression of cerebrovascular white matter disease, in patients and in animal models, suggesting that targeting microglial proliferation may exert protection. Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) is a key regulator of microglial proliferation. We found that the expression of CSF1R/Csf1r and other markers indicative of increased microglial abundance are significantly elevated in damaged white matter in human cerebrovascular disease and in a clinically relevant mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular cognitive impairment. Using the mouse model, we investigated long-term pharmacological CSF1R inhibition, via GW2580, and demonstrated that the expansion of microglial numbers in chronic hypoperfused white matter is prevented. Transcriptomic analysis of hypoperfused white matter tissue showed enrichment of microglial and inflammatory gene sets, including phagocytic genes that were the predominant expression modules modified by CSF1R inhibition. Further, CSF1R inhibition attenuated hypoperfusion-induced white matter pathology and rescued spatial learning impairments and to a lesser extent cognitive flexibility. Overall, this work suggests that inhibition of CSF1R and microglial proliferation mediates protection against chronic cerebrovascular white matter pathology and cognitive deficits. Our study nominates CSF1R as a target for the treatment of vascular cognitive disorders with broader implications for treatment of other chronic white matter diseases.',\n",

AD is also one of the main causes of disability and death of the elderly in current aging society. One of the most common symptoms of AD is spatial memory impairment, which occurs in more than 60% of patients. This memory loss is closely related to the impairment of cognitive maps in the brain. The entorhinal grid cells and the hippocampal place cells are important cellular basis for spatial memory and navigation functions in the brain. Understanding the abnormal firing pattern of these neurons and their impaired coordination to neural oscillations in transgenic rodents is crucial for identifying the therapeutic targets for AD. In this article, we review recent studies on neural activity based on transgenic rodent models of AD, with a focus on the changes in the firing characteristics of neurons and the abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. We also discuss potential cell-network mechanism of spatial memory disorders caused by AD, so as to provide a scientific basis for the diagnosis and treatment of AD in the future.\",\n",

The pathogenesis of AD is still uncertain and intricate, and helpful therapy has rarely been recorded. So, discovering amyloid modulators is deemed a promising avenue for preventing and treating AD. In this study, human serum albumin (HSA), a protein-based Aβ inhibitor, was utilized as a template to guide the synthesis of HSA-manganese dioxide nanocomposites (HMn NCs) through biomineralization. The in situ formed MnO2 in HSA endows this nano-platform with outstanding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability, including superoxide dismutase-mimetic and catalase-mimetic activities, which could scavenge the plethora of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide. More importantly, the HMn NCs show enhanced potency in suppressing Aβ fibrillization compared with HSA, which further alleviates Aβ-mediated SH-SY5Y neurotoxicity by scavenging excessive ROS. Moreover, it is demonstrated that HMn NCs reduce Aβ-related inflammation in BV-2 cells by lowering tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. Furthermore, transgenic C. elegans studies showed that HMn NCs could remove Aβ plaques, reduce ROS in CL2006 worms, and promote the lifespan extension of worms. Thus, HMn NCs provide a promising tactic to facilitate the application of multifunctional nanocomposites in AD treatment.\",\n",

We found that performance in a hippocampus-dependent memory task was impaired in young adult and aged mutant mice. In both age groups, we then recorded from the CA1 region, which receives inputs from APP-expressing CA3 cells. We observed that theta oscillation frequency in CA1 was reduced along with disrupted relative timing of principal cells. Highly localized pathology limited to the presynaptic CA3 cells is thus sufficient to cause aberrant firing patterns in postsynaptic neuronal networks, which indicates that disease progression is not only from spreading pathology but also mediated by progressively advancing physiological dysfunction.\",\n",

This ground-breaking progress in AD medicine has validated both the amyloid cascade hypothesis and Aβ-amyloid as therapeutic targets. These results also strongly support therapeutic approaches that aim to reduce the production of amyloidogenic Aβ to prevent the formation of Aβ-pathology. One such strategy, so-called gamma-secretase modulators (GSM), has been thoroughly explored in preclinical settings but has yet to be fully tested in clinical trials. Recent scientific progress has shed new light on the role of Aβ in Alzheimer's disease and suggests that GSMs exhibit specific pharmacological features that hold great promise for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In this short review, we discuss the data that support why it is important to continue to progress in this class of compounds.\",\n",

Microglia perform multiple functions in the central nervous system, including surveillance, phagocytosis and release of a variety of soluble factors. Importantly, a majority of their functions are closely related to changes in their metabolism. This natural inter-dependency between core microglial properties and metabolism offers a unique opportunity to modulate microglial activities via nutritional or metabolic interventions. In this review, we examine the existing scientific literature to synthesize the hypothesis that microglial phagocytosis of amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be selectively enhanced via metabolic interventions. We first review the basics of microglial metabolism and the effects of common metabolites, such as glucose, lipids, ketone bodies, glutamine, pyruvate and lactate, on microglial inflammatory and phagocytic properties. Next, we examine the evidence for dysregulation of microglial metabolism in AD. This is followed by a review of in vivo studies on metabolic manipulation of microglial functions to ascertain their therapeutic potential in AD. Finally, we discuss the effects of metabolic factors on microglial phagocytosis of healthy synapses, a pathological process that also contributes to the progression of AD. We conclude by enlisting the current challenges that need to be addressed before strategies to harness microglial phagocytosis to clear pathological protein deposits in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders can be widely adopted.\",\n",

Here we have investigated the sequential onset of AD-like pathologies in AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F knock-in mice by time-course transcriptome analysis of hippocampus, a region severely affected in AD. Strikingly, energy metabolism emerged as one of the most significantly altered pathways already at an early stage of pathology. Functional experiments in isolated mitochondria from hippocampus of both AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F mice confirmed an upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation driven by the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, IV and V, associated with higher susceptibility to oxidative damage and Ca2+-overload. Upon increasing pathologies, the brain shifts to a state of hypometabolism with reduced abundancy of mitochondria in presynaptic terminals. These late-stage mice also displayed enlarged presynaptic areas associated with abnormal accumulation of synaptic vesicles and autophagosomes, the latter ultimately leading to local autophagy impairment in the synapses. In summary, we report that Aβ-induced pathways in App knock-in mouse models recapitulate key pathologies observed in AD brain, and our data herein adds a comprehensive understanding of the pathologies including dysregulated metabolism and synapses and their timewise appearance to find new therapeutic approaches for AD.\",\n",

Passive immunotherapies using monoclonal antibodies for targeting Aβ have shown promise for AD treatment. Indeed, recent US FDA approval of aducanumab and lecanemab, alongside positive donanemab Phase III results demonstrated clinical efficacy after decades of failed clinical trials for AD. However, the pharmacological basis distinguishing clinically effective from ineffective therapies remains unclear, impeding development of potent therapeutics. This study aimed to provide a quantitative perspective for effectively targeting Aβ with antibodies. We first reviewed the contradicting results associated with amyloid hypothesis and the pharmacological basis of Aβ immunotherapy. Subsequently, we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model that describes the non-linear progression of Aβ pathology and the pharmacologic actions of the Aβ-targeting antibodies. Using the QSP model, we analyzed various scenarios for effective passive immunotherapy for AD. The model revealed that binding exclusively to the Aβ monomer has minimal effect on Aβ aggregation and plaque reduction, therefore antibody affinity towards Aβ monomer is unwanted, as it could become a distractive mechanism for plaque reduction. Neither early intervention, high brain penetration, nor increased dose alone could yield significant improvement of clinical efficacy for antibodies targeting solely monomers. Antibodies that bind all Aβ species but lack effector function exhibited moderate effects in plaque reduction. Our model highlights the importance of binding aggregate Aβ species and incorporating effector functions for efficient and early plaque reduction, guiding the development of more effective therapies for this devastating disease. Significance Statement Despite previous unsuccessful attempts spanning several decades, passive immunotherapies utilizing monoclonal antibodies for targeting amyloid-beta (Aβ) have demonstrated promise with two recent FDA approvals. However, the pharmacological basis that differentiates clinically effective therapies from ineffective ones remains elusive. Our study offers a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) perspective, emphasizing the significance of selectively targeting specific Aβ species and importance of antibody effector functions. This perspective sheds light on the development of more effective therapies for this devastating disease.\",\n",

This redistribution was accompanied by increased ASIC1a current amplitude upon activation, as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated CaMKII and ERK kinases. Additionally, we observed posttranslational modifications on the ASIC1a channel itself. These findings provide insight into a potential link between inflammatory processes and neurodegenerative mechanisms, highlighting ASIC1a channels as promising therapeutic targets in these conditions.\",\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"The risk of neurodegeneration was found to be increased among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and others are considered neurodegenerative diseases and can be characterized by progressive loss of neurons. The deficiency of insulin, impaired signaling, and its resistance lead to alteration in the neuronal functioning of the brain. Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a significant role in the amyloid β metabolism, aggregation, and deposition of misfolded proteins in the brain's hippocampal and cortical neuronal regions. The insulin signaling via IP3 activation upregulates the IDE and could be a promising approach to regulate neurodegeneration. The repurposing of existing antidiabetic drugs such as Metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1), sodium-glucose co-transport-2 (SGCT-2) inhibitors, and insulin could be an alternative and effective strategy to treat neurodegeneration via modulating insulin signaling, insulin resistance, IDE activity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, serum lipid profile and neuroinflammation in the brain. Antidiabetic medications reduce the risk of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and Aβ deposition by enhancing their clearance rate. The downregulation of IDE alters the degradation of Aβ monomers in the Tg2576 APP mice. Also, the treatment with metformin activated the AMPK pathway and suppressed mTOR and BACE-1 protein expression in the APP/PS1-induced mice model. Thus, the primary intention of this review is to explore the link between T2DM and neurodegenerative disorders, and the possible role of various antidiabetic drugs in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.\",\n",

However, the limited toolbox of pharmacological assays hampers the development of advanced ligands. Here, we developed a signaling pathway-independent readout of compound-GPR3 interaction. Starting from computational binding pose predictions of the most potent GPR3 ligand, we designed a series of fluorescent AF64394 analogues and assessed their suitability for BRET-based binding studies. The most potent ligand, 45 (UR-MB-355), bound to GPR3 and closely related receptors, GPR6 and GPR12, with similar submicromolar affinities. Furthermore, we found that 45 engages GPR3 in a distinct mode compared to AF64394, and coincubation studies with the GPR3 agonist diphenyleneiodonium chloride revealed allosteric modulation of 45 binding. These insights provide new cues for the pharmacological manipulation of GPR3 activity.

Extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition and secondary persistent inflammation due to activation of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrated immune cells contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neurodegeneration. The majority of evidence supports the neuroprotective effects of Treg cells in AD. In the early stages of AD, appropriate Treg cell activity is required for the induction of microglia and astrocyte phagocytic activity in order to clear A deposits and prevent neuroinflammation. Such neuroprotective impacts were in part attributed to the ability of Treg cells to suppress deleterious and/or boost beneficial functions of microglia/astrocytes. In the later stages of AD, an effective Treg cell activity needs to prevent neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Treg cells can exert preventive effects on Th1-, and Th17 cell-related pathologic responses, whilst potentiating Th2-mediated protective activity. The impaired Treg cell-related immunomodulatory mechanisms have been described in AD patients and in related animal models which can contribute to the onset and progression of AD.

Curcumin is a small polyphenolic molecule that provides an interesting opportunity to understand the fundamental mechanisms of membrane-mediated aggregation because it embeds into membranes to alter their structure while also altering Aβ aggregation in an aqueous environment. The purpose of this work was to understand interactions among curcumin, β-sheet-rich Aβ fibrillar oligomers (FO), and a model anionic membrane. From a combination of liquid surface X-ray scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we found that curcumin embedded into an anionic 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylglycerol (DMPG) membrane to rest between the lipid headgroups and the tails, causing disorder and membrane thinning. FO accumulation on the membrane was reduced by ∼66% in the presence of curcumin, likely influenced by membrane thinning. Simulation results suggested curcumin clusters near exposed phenylalanine residues on a membrane-embedded FO structure. Altogether, curcumin inhibited FO interactions with a DMPG membrane, likely through a combination of altered membrane structure and interactions with the FO surface. This work elucidates the mechanism of curcumin as a small molecule that inhibits amyloidogenesis through a combination of both membrane and protein interactions.\",\n",

Methylation of N6 adenosine (m6A) and C5 cytosine (m5C) bases occur on mRNAs, tRNA, mt-tRNA, and rRNA species as well as non-coding RNAs. With emerging knowledge of RNA binding proteins that act as writer, reader, and eraser effector proteins, comes a new understanding of physiological processes controlled by these systems. Such processes when spatiotemporally disrupted within cellular nanodomains in highly specialized tissues such as the brain, give rise to different forms of disease. In this review, we discuss accumulating evidence that changes in the m6A and m5C methylation systems contribute to neurocognitive disorders. Early studies first identified mutations within FMR1 to cause intellectual disability Fragile X syndromes several years before FMR1 was identified as an m6A RNA reader protein. Subsequently, familial mutations within the m6A writer gene METTL5, m5C writer genes NSUN2, NSUN3, NSUN5, and NSUN6, as well as THOC2 and THOC6 that form a protein complex with the m5C reader protein ALYREF, were recognized to cause intellectual development disorders. Similarly, differences in expression of the m5C writer and reader effector proteins, NSUN6, NSUN7, and ALYREF in brain tissue are indicated in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, individuals with a high neuropathological load or have suffered traumatic brain injury. Likewise, an abundance of m6A reader and anti-reader proteins are reported to change across brain regions in Lewy bodies diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with high cognitive reserve. m6A-modified RNAs are also reported significantly more abundant in dementia with Lewy bodies brain tissue but significantly reduced in Parkinson's disease tissue, whilst modified RNAs are misplaced within diseased cells, particularly where synapses are located. In parahippocampal brain tissue, m6A modification is enriched in transcripts associated with psychiatric disorders including conditions with clear cognitive deficits. These findings indicate a diverse set of molecular mechanisms are influenced by RNA methylation systems that can cause neuronal and synaptic dysfunction underlying neurocognitive disorders.

Numerous studies have asserted a close association between neuroinflammation and disrupted cerebral energetics. During AD progression and other neurodegenerative disorders, a persistent state of chronic neuroinflammation reportedly exacerbates cytotoxicity and potentiates neuronal death. Here, we assessed the impact of a neuroinflammatory challenge on metabolic demand and microvascular hemodynamics in the somatosensory cortex of an AD mouse model. We utilized in vivo 2-photon microscopy and the phosphorescent oxygen sensor Oxyphor 2P to measure partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and capillary red blood cell flux in cortical microvessels of awake mice. Intravascular pO2 and capillary RBC flux measurements were performed in 8-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and wildtype littermates on days 0, 7, and 14 of a 14-day period of lipopolysaccaride-induced neuroinflammation. Before the induced inflammatory challenge, AD mice demonstrated reduced metabolic demand but similar capillary red blood cell flux as their wild type counterparts. Neuroinflammation provoked significant reductions in cerebral intravascular oxygen levels and elevated oxygen extraction in both animal groups, without significantly altering red blood cell flux in capillaries. This study provides evidence that neuroinflammation alters cerebral oxygen demand at the early stages of AD without substantially altering vascular oxygen supply. The results will guide our understanding of neuroinflammation's influence on neuroimaging biomarkers for early AD diagnosis.\",\n",

       "  'AbstractText': \"The PINK1-PRKN pathway mediates a critical quality control to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for APOE4 (rs429358; β : 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.69; p =8.67x10 -25 ) and a genome-wide significant association for ZMIZ1 (rs6480922; β : -0.33, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.22; p =1.42x10 -8 ). The increased p-S65-Ub levels in APOE4 -carrier may be mediated by both co-pathology-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which was confirmed in Apoe-targeted replacement mice and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Intriguingly, ZMIZ1 rs6480922 also significantly associated with increased brain weight and reduced neuropathological burden indicating a potential role as a resilience factor. Our findings nominate novel mitophagy regulators in LBD brain ( ZMIZ1 locus) and highlight a strong association of APOE4 with mitophagy alteration. With APOE4 being the strongest known risk factor for clinical Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, our findings suggest a common mechanistic link underscoring the importance of mitochondrial quality control.\",\n",

These phenotypes correlate with and are linked to elevated neuronal intracellular calcium ( i Ca 2+ ) levels. Recently, our group reported that mitochondrial calcium ( m Ca 2+ ) overload, due to loss of m Ca 2+ efflux capacity, contributes to AD development and progression. We also noted proteomic remodeling of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel (mtCU) in sporadic AD brain samples, suggestive of altered m Ca 2+ uptake in AD. Since the mtCU is the primary mechanism for Ca 2+ uptake into the mitochondrial matrix, inhibition of the mtCU has the potential to reduce or prevent m Ca 2+ overload in AD. Here, we report that neuronal-specific loss of mtCU-dependent m Ca 2+ uptake in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD reduced Aβ and tau-pathology, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Knockdown of Mcu in a cellular model of AD significantly decreased matrix Ca 2+ content, oxidative stress, and cell death.

Here, we describe a general procedure for generating atomic descriptions required to incorporate ncAAs within popular NMR structure determination software such as CYANA, CNS, Xplor-NIH and ARIA. This procedure is made publicly available via the existing Automated Topology Builder (ATB) server (https://atb.uq.edu.au, last access: 17 February 2023) with all submitted ncAAs stored in a dedicated database. The described procedure also includes a general method for linking of side\\xa0chains of amino acids from CYANA templates.

In addition to describing the workflow, 3D models of complex natural products generated by CYANA are presented, including vancomycin. In order to demonstrate the manner in which the templates for ncAAs generated by the ATB can be used in practice, we use a combination of CYANA and CNS to solve the structure of a synthetic peptide designed to disrupt Alzheimer-related protein-protein interactions. Automating the generation of structural templates for ncAAs will extend the utility of NMR spectroscopy to studies of more complex biomolecules, with applications in the rapidly growing fields of synthetic biology and chemical biology.

The review underscores the need for a standardized diagnostic paradigm and explores research gaps, such as the implications of cognitive impairment in younger populations and various diabetes types. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the relevance of diabetes-related comorbidities, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, in influencing cognitive decline. It advocates for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from neuroscience, endocrinology, and immunology to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of diabetes-related cognitive impairment. The second part of this review outlines prospective research directions and opportunities. It advocates for longitudinal studies to understand disease progression better and identifies critical windows of vulnerability. The search for accurate biomarkers and predictive factors is paramount, encompassing genetic and epigenetic considerations.

The brain correlates of these non-image-forming effects have been investigated, notably using magnetic resonance imaging and short light exposures varying in irradiance and spectral quality. However, it is not clear whether non-image-forming responses estimation may be biased by having light in sequential blocks, for example, through a potential carryover effect of one light onto the next. We reasoned that pupil light reflex was an easy readout of one of the non-image-forming effects of light that could be used to address this issue. We characterised the sustained pupil light reflex in 13-16 healthy young individuals under short light exposures during three distinct cognitive processes (executive, emotional and attentional). Light conditions pseudo-randomly alternated between monochromatic orange light (0.16 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux) and polychromatic blue-enriched white light of three different levels (37, 92, 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux). As expected, higher melanopic irradiance was associated with larger sustained pupil light reflex in each cognitive domain. This result was stable over the light sequence under higher melanopic irradiance levels compared with lower ones. Exploratory frequency-domain analyses further revealed that sustained pupil light reflex was more variable under lower melanopic irradiance levels. Importantly, sustained pupil light reflex varied across tasks independently of the light condition, pointing to a potential impact of light history and/or cognitive context on sustained pupil light reflex. Together, our results emphasise that the distinct contribution and adaptation of the different retinal photoreceptors influence the non-image-forming effects of light and therefore potentially their brain correlates.',\n",

Evidence has emerged that ALS may coexist with distinct neurodegenerative diseases in single cases.

We included definite familial ALS followed up in the Department of Neurology of Razi University Hospital, Tunisia, and selected according to Byrne criteria. Preliminary screening for the four main ALS genes (SOD1, C9ORF72, TARDBP, FUS) was conducted. Given the negative results, we proceeded to NGS target-re-sequencing with a custom panel including genes associated with ALS-FTD, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Both families are carriers of two different OPTN variants and they present very different ALS clinical features. The first family comprises two siblings diagnosed with ALS and Corticobasal syndrome (ALS-CBS) at an early age of onset and carriers of OPTN p.E135X in the homozygous state. The proband for the second family was diagnosed with ALS at an early age of onset presenting as progressive muscular atrophy with rapid progression. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of the homozygous variant p.R520H.Our findings highlight the peculiarity of genetic Tunisian drift. Indeed, genes with a recessive mode of inheritance may explain part of ALS diversity in clinical features.

Furthermore, the tau PTM profile changes during tau pathology formation and disease progression, and disease-specific PTMs are detected in and around the filament core. In addition, templated seeding has been suggested to trigger pathological tau amplification and spreading in vitro and in vivo, although the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.

Here, we investigated PTMs of tau filaments accumulated in the seeded cells by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and compared them with the PTMs of patient-derived tau filaments. Examination of insoluble tau extracted from SH-SY5Y cells showed that numerous phosphorylation, deamidation and oxidation sites detected in the fuzzy coat in the original seeds were well reproduced in SH-SY5Y cells.

It is estimated that one in three elderly people die from AD or other dementias. Chinese herbal medicine as a potential drug for treating AD has gained growing interest from many researchers. Moschus, a rare and valuable traditional Chinese animal medicine, was originally documented in Shennong Ben Cao Jing and recognized for its properties of reviving consciousness/resuscitation. Additionally, Moschus has the efficacy of \"regulation of menstruation with blood activation, relief of swelling and pain\" and is used for treating unconsciousness, stroke, coma, and cerebrovascular diseases. However, it is uncertain whether Moschus has any protective effect on AD patients. We explored whether Moschus could protect glutamate (Glu)-induced PC12 cells from cellular injury and preliminarily explored their related action mechanisms. The chemical compounds of Moschus were analyzed and identified by GC-MS. The Glu-induced differentiated PC12 cell model was thought to be the common AD cellular model. The study aims to preliminarily investigate the intervention effect of Moschus on Glu-induced PC12 cell damage as well as their related action mechanisms. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cell apoptosis, autophagic vacuoles, autolysosomes or autophagosomes, proteins related to apoptosis, and the proteins related to autophagy were examined and analyzed. Seventeen active compounds of the Moschus sample were identified based on GC-MS analysis. In comparison to the control group, Glu stimulation increased cell viability loss, LDH release, mitochondrial damage, loss of MMP, apoptosis rate, and the number of cells containing autophagic vacuoles, and autolysosomes or autophagosomes, while these results were decreased after the pretreatment with Moschus and 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Furthermore, Glu stimulation significantly increased cleaved caspase-3, Beclin1, and LC3II protein expression, and reduced B-cell lymphoma 2/BAX ratio and p62 protein expression, but these results were reversed after pretreatment of Moschus and 3-MA. Moschus has protective activity in Glu-induced PC12 cell injury, and the potential mechanism might involve the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. Our study may promote research on Moschus in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, and Moschus may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.',\n",

The brain structures involved in the physiopathology of apathy have also been connected to the brain structures involved in probabilistic reward learning in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This dilemma in question involves the challenge of selecting between a familiar option with a more predictable outcome, and another option whose outcome is uncertain and may yield potentially greater rewards compared to the known option. The aim of this study was to combine experimental procedures and computational modeling to examine whether, in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorders, apathy affects performance in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Through using a four-armed bandit reinforcement-learning task, we showed that apathetic older adults explored more and performed worse than non-apathetic subjects. Moreover, the mental flexibility assessed by the Trail-making test-B was negatively associated with the percentage of exploration. These results suggest that apathy is characterized by an increased explorative behavior and inefficient decision-making, possibly due to weak mental flexibility to switch toward the exploitation of the more rewarding options. Apathetic participants also took longer to make a choice and failed more often to respond in the allotted time, which could reflect the difficulties in action initiation and selection. In conclusion, the present results suggest that apathy in participants with neurocognitive disorders is associated with specific disturbances in the exploration-exploitation trade-off and sheds light on the disturbances in reward processing in patients with apathy.',\n",

Here, we show that neuregulin-1, a glial growth factor, induces inflammatory cytokines and promotes phagocytic activity in vitro and augments microglial activation and plaque formation in 5XFAD Alzheimer's mice. Brain-specific targeting of neuregulin-1 by intraventricular delivery of a novel neuregulin-1 fusion protein antagonist GlyB4 significantly alters microglial morphology and function to a non-pathogenic morphology in early-stage 5XFAD mice and prevents plaques from forming. Once plaques have already formed, GlyB4 reduces new plaque formation and prevents synaptic loss. Selective, targeted disruption of neuregulin-1 signaling on brain microglia with GlyB4 could be a novel 'upstream' approach to slow or stop disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.Significance StatementMicroglia-associated neuroinflammation is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we show that neuregulin1 (NRG1), an important neuron-glial signaling factor in development, induces microglial activation and promotes pathological changes in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of NRG1 using a targeted NRG1 antagonist called GlyB4 blocks NRG1 receptor activation in microglia, reduces Amyloid β plaque formation, and prevents synaptic loss. While NRG1 clearly has important functions at other sites in the nervous system, excessive NRG1 signaling in microglia leads to pathological neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Selective disruption of NRG1 signaling in microglia using GlyB4 could be a novel approach to block disease progression in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

While a popular therapeutic target, it is unknown whether molecular mechanisms leading to disrupted L-VGCC across neurodegenerative disorders are conserved. Importantly, L-VGCC integrate synaptic signals to facilitate a plethora of cellular mechanisms; however, mechanisms that regulate L-VGCC channel density and subcellular compartmentalization are understudied. Herein, we report that in disease models with overactive mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling (or mTORopathies), deficits in dendritic L-VGCC activity are associated with increased expression of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Parkinsonism-associated deglycase (DJ-1). DJ-1 binds the mRNA coding for the alpha and auxiliary Ca2+ channel subunits CaV1.2 and α2δ2, and represses their mRNA translation, only in the disease states, specifically preclinical models of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In agreement, DJ-1-mediated repression of CaV1.2/α2δ2 protein synthesis in dendrites is exaggerated in mouse models of AD and TSC, resulting in deficits in dendritic L-VGCC calcium activity. Finding of DJ-1-regulated L-VGCC activity in dendrites in TSC and AD provides a unique signaling pathway that can be targeted in clinical mTORopathies.\",\n",

This study aimed to examine the neuroprotective efficacy of ROP in a stereotaxis model of AD. The Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups.

At the same time, ROP was rescued from oxidative damage, decreased lipid peroxidation rates, and inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity caused, demonstrating antioxidant benefits. In addition, a higher dose of ROP restored mitochondrial membrane potential in Aβ1-42 rats. Furthermore, histopathological examination showed that ROP treatment reduced neuronal loss, especially in the hippocampus.

Histone methylation was a reversible modification, catalyzed by histone methyltransferases and demethylases. So far, dozens of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) have been discovered, and they (members from KDM1 to KDM7 family) are important for neurodevelopment by regulating cellular processes, such as chromatin structure and gene transcription. The role of KDM5C and KDM7B in neural development is particularly important, and mutations in both genes are frequently found in human X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Functional disorders of specific KDMs, such as KDM1A can lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several KDMs can serve as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. At present, the function of KDMs in neurodegenerative diseases is not fully understood, so more comprehensive and profound studies are needed. Here, the role and mechanism of histone demethylases were summarized in neurodevelopment, and the potential of them was introduced in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.\",\n",

Using different navigation tasks, many promising results have been achieved on the specific functions of various brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal place area). Recently, it has been suggested that a non-aggregate network process involving multiple interacting brain regions may better characterize the neural basis of this complex function. This paper presents an integrative approach for constructing and analyzing the functionally-specific network for spatial navigation in the human brain. Briefly, this integrative approach consists of three major steps: 1) to identify brain regions important for spatial navigation (nodes definition); 2) to estimate functional connectivity between each pair of these regions and construct the connectivity matrix (network construction); 3) to investigate the topological properties (e.g., modularity and small worldness) of the resulting network (network analysis). The presented approach, from a network perspective, could help us better understand how our brain supports flexible navigation in complex and dynamic environments, and the revealed topological properties of the network can also provide important biomarkers for guiding early identification and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice.\",\n",

Discussions of patients' needs and preferences between nurses and the patient's close family members have been found to be useful in preventing excessive stress in persons with dementia, while lessening the anxiety of care partners. However, the efficacy of dementia-specific interventions is influenced in part by the degree to which the interventions are flexible and sensitive to the patient's and care-partner's condition, needs, and preferences, including cultural preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the cultural appropriateness of Fam-FFC using the Ecological Validity Model (EVM). This qualitative, descriptive study included 28 consented care partners drawn from a sample of 455 dyads enrolled in the Fam-FFC intervention. An interview guide was created based on the EVM.

We here assessed the effects of ELS on synaptic function and composition in the hippocampus of male mice. Mice were subjected to ELS by housing dams and pups with limited bedding and nesting material from postnatal days (P) 2-9. Synaptic strength was measured in terms of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus at three different developmental stages: the early postnatal phase (P9), preadolescence (P21, at weaning) and adulthood at 3\\u2009months of age (3MO). Hippocampal synaptosome fractions were isolated from P9 and 3MO tissue and analyzed for protein content to assess postsynaptic composition. Finally, dendritic spine density was assessed in the DG at 3MO. At P9, ELS increased mEPSC frequency and amplitude. In parallel, synaptic composition was altered as PSD-95, GluA3 and GluN2B content were significantly decreased. The increased mEPSC frequency was sustained up to 3MO, at which age, GluA3 content was significantly increased. No differences were found in dendritic spine density. These findings highlight how ELS affects the development of hippocampal synapses, which could provide valuable insight into mechanisms how ELS alters brain function later in life.',\n",

Here, a three-dimensional Alzheimer's disease model was developed using a compartmentalized microfluidic device that combines a self-assembled microvascular network of the human blood-brain barrier with neurospheres derived from Alzheimer's disease-specific neural progenitor cells. To shorten microfluidic co-culture times, neurospheres were pre-differentiated for 21\\xa0days to express Alzheimer's disease-specific pathological phenotypes prior to the introduction into the microfluidic device. In agreement with post-mortem studies and Alzheimer's disease in vivo models, after 7\\xa0days of co-culture with pre-differentiated Alzheimer's disease-specific neurospheres, the three-dimensional blood-brain barrier network exhibited significant changes in barrier permeability and morphology. Furthermore, vascular networks in co-culture with Alzheimer's disease-specific microtissues displayed localized β-amyloid deposition. Thus, by interconnecting a microvascular network of the blood-brain barrier with pre-differentiated neurospheres the presented model holds immense potential for replicating key neurovascular phenotypes of neurodegenerative disorders in vitro.\",\n",

The three most significant SNPs (rs4787307, rs9903904, and rs11079797) on these genes are associated with the regulation of the LCMT1, OSBPL7, and SCRN2 genes, respectively. These SNPs are involved in decreasing hippocampal volume and cognitive scores by mediating Aβ uptake. The 19 enriched gene sets identified by pathway analysis included axon and chemokine activity. Our findings suggest novel susceptibility genes associated with the uptake of Aβ, which in turn leads to worse clinical outcomes. Our findings might lead to the discovery of new AD treatment targets.\",\n",

Introducing genetic background diversity in AD mouse models has been proposed as a way to increase validity and enable the discovery of previously uncharacterized genetic contributions to AD susceptibility or resilience. However, the extent to which genetic background influences the mouse brain proteome and its perturbation in AD mouse models is unknown. In this study, we crossed the 5XFAD AD mouse model on a C57BL/6J (B6) inbred background with the DBA/2J (D2) inbred background and analyzed the effects of genetic background variation on the brain proteome in F1 progeny. Both genetic background and 5XFAD transgene insertion strongly affected protein variance in the hippocampus and cortex (n = 3,368 proteins). Protein co-expression network analysis identified 16 modules of highly co-expressed proteins common across the hippocampus and cortex in 5XFAD and non-transgenic mice. Among the modules strongly influenced by genetic background were those related to small molecule metabolism and ion transport. Modules strongly influenced by the 5XFAD transgene were related to lysosome/stress responses and neuronal synapse/signaling. The modules with the strongest relationship to human disease-neuronal synapse/signaling and lysosome/stress response-were not significantly influenced by genetic background. However, other modules in 5XFAD that were related to human disease, such as GABA synaptic signaling and mitochondrial membrane modules, were influenced by genetic background. Most disease-related modules were more strongly correlated with AD genotype in the hippocampus compared with the cortex. Our findings suggest that the genetic diversity introduced by crossing B6 and D2 inbred backgrounds influences proteomic changes related to disease in the 5XFAD model, and that proteomic analysis of other genetic backgrounds in transgenic and knock-in AD mouse models is warranted to capture the full range of molecular heterogeneity in genetically diverse models of AD.\",\n",

The gene comes in two major haplotypes, one associated with disease risk, and by comparison, the other with resilience. Only one coding polymorphism distinguishes the two alleles, a threonine-to-serine substitution at residue 185 (186 in mouse), that is inherited in disequilibrium with multiple non-coding variants. Transcriptional studies suggest synaptic, neuronal, and cognitive preservation in human subjects with the protective haplotype, while murine in vitro studies reveal dramatic effects of TMEM106B deletion on neuronal development. Despite this foundation, the field has not yet resolved whether coding variant is biologically meaningful, and if so, whether it has any specific effect on neuronal phenotypes. Here we studied how loss of TMEM106B or expression of the lone coding variant in isolation affected transcriptional signatures in the mature brain and neuronal structure during development in primary neurons. Homozygous expression of the TMEM106B T186S variant in knock-in mice increased cortical expression of genes associated with excitatory synaptic function and axon outgrowth, and promoted neurite branching, dendritic spine density, and synaptic density in primary hippocampal neurons. In contrast, constitutive TMEM106B deletion affected transcriptional signatures of myelination without altering neuronal development in vitro.

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with monocyte or T-cell-targeted stimuli, and multiplex assays quantitated cytokines in the conditioned media. Following T-cell-targeted stimulation, cells from women with cognitive impairment produced lower amounts of TH17 cytokines compared with cells from cognitively healthy women, while myeloid-targeted stimuli elicited similar amounts of cytokines from cells of both groups. This TH17 signature correlated with the proportion of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light concentrations.

However, few mouse models of AD recapitulate the neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system. The p75 neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, has been associated with the degeneration of BFCNs in AD. The senescence-accelerated mouse prone number 8 (SAMP8) is a well-accepted model of accelerated and pathological aging. To gain a better understanding of the role of p75NTR in the basal forebrain during aging, we generated a new mouse line, the SAMP8-p75exonIII-/-. Deletion of p75NTR in the SAMP8 background induces an increase in the number of BFCNs at birth, followed by a rapid decline during aging compared to the C57/BL6 background. This decrease in the number of BFCNs correlates with a worsening in the Y-maze memory test at 6\\u2009months in the SAMP8-p75exonIII-/-. We found that SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- and C57/BL6-p75exonIII-/- mice expressed constitutively a short isoform of p75NTR that correlates with an upregulation of the protein levels of SREBP2 and its targets, HMGCR and LDLR, in the BF of both SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- and C57/BL6-p75exonIII-/- mice. As the neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system and the dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism are implicated in AD, we postulate that the generated SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- mouse strain might constitute a good model to study long-term cholinergic neurodegeneration in the CNS.

Since the neuronal cytoskeleton is a common downstream pathological target of tau and Aβ, which mostly lead to augmented microtubule instability, the administration of microtubule stabilizing agents (MSAs) can protect against their pathological actions. However, the effectiveness of MSAs is still uncertain due to their state-dependent negative effects; thus, evaluating their specific actions in different pathological or physiological conditions is required. We evaluated whether epothilone-D (Epo-D), a clinically used MSA, rescues from the functional and behavioral alterations produced by intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ, the presence of P-tau, or their combination in rTg4510 mice. We also explored the side effects of Epo-D. To do so, we evaluated hippocampal-dependent spatial memory with the Hebb-Williams maze, hippocampal CA1 integrity and the intrinsic and synaptic properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons with the patch-clamp technique. Aβ and P-tau mildly impaired memory retrieval, but produced contrasting effects on intrinsic excitability. When Aβ and P-tau were combined, the alterations in excitability and spatial reversal learning (i.e., cognitive flexibility) were exacerbated. Interestingly, Epo-D prevented most of the impairments induced Aβ and P-tau alone and combined. However, Epo-D also exhibited some side effects depending on the prevailing pathological or physiological condition, which should be considered in future preclinical and translational studies. Although we did not perform extensive histopathological evaluations or measured microtubule stability, our findings show that MSAs can rescue the consequences of AD-like conditions but otherwise be harmful if administered at a prodromal stage of the disease.\",\n",

Previous studies have implicated different autophagy receptors in directing distinct species of MAPT to autophagy, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Here we examine how the autophagy receptors NBR1 and SQSTM1 differentially associate with specific forms of MAPT. In primary neurons depletion of NBR1, unlike depletion of SQSTM1, significantly increased phosphorylated MAPT levels. The specificity of the interactions was confirmed using in vitro binding assays with purified proteins. We provide direct evidence that the co-chaperone BAG3 promotes the preferential association of NBR1 with monomeric MAPT and SQSTM1 with oligomeric MAPT. Using an in vitro affinity-isolation assay, we show that SQSTM1 only binds to monomeric MAPT when BAG3 is absent and fails to bind when BAG3 is present. The opposite is true of NBR1; its association with monomeric MAPT was dependent on the presence of BAG3. Interestingly, in Alzheimer disease brain the association of NBR1 with BAG3 was significantly decreased. In a mouse model, ablation of BAG3 in neural cells disrupted the association of NBR1 with phosphorylated MAPT and led to increased levels of phosphorylated and oligomeric MAPT. Overall, our results uncover a novel role for BAG3 in regulating the specificity of selective autophagy receptors in targeting different species of MAPT and provide compelling evidence that BAG3 plays a key role in maintaining MAPT proteostasis.',\n",

Inflammation is associated with multiple diseases including classical neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which over half of all patients experience some form of cognitive deficits. Other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) including frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and psychological disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), and even normal aging all have cytokine-associated reductions in cognitive function. Thus, there is likely commonality between these secondary cognitive deficits and inflammation. Neurological disorders are increasingly associated with substantial neuroinflammation, in which CNS-resident cells secrete cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α and interleukins (ILs) including IL-1β and IL-6. CNS-resident cells also respond to a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines, which can have both direct effects on neurons by changing the expression of ion channels and perturbing electrical properties, as well as indirect effects through glia-glia and immune-glia cross-talk. There is significant overlap in these cytokine and chemokine expression profiles across diseases, with TNFα and IL-6 strongly associated with cognitive deficits in multiple disorders. Here, we review the involvement of various cytokines and chemokines in AD, MS, FTLD, PD, TBI, MDD, and normal aging in the absence of dementia. We propose that the neuropsychiatric phenotypes observed in these disorders may be at least partially attributable to a dysregulation of immunity resulting in pathological cytokine and chemokine expression from both CNS-resident and non-resident cells.\",\n",

Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish amyloid from non-amyloid proteins or peptides. While experimental approaches are typically preferred, they are costly and time-consuming. In this study, we have developed a machine learning framework called iAMY-RECMFF to discriminate amyloidgenic from non-amyloidgenic peptides. In our model, we first encoded the peptide sequences using the residue pairwise energy content matrix. We then utilized Pearson's correlation coefficient and distance correlation to extract useful information from this matrix. Additionally, we employed an improved similarity network fusion algorithm to integrate features from different perspectives. The Fisher approach was adopted to select the optimal feature subset. Finally, the selected features were inputted into a support vector machine for identifying amyloidgenic peptides. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the identification of amyloidgenic peptides compared to existing predictors. This suggests that our method may serve as a powerful tool in identifying amyloidgenic peptides.

Advantage of a multisystemic approach is then taken to compare plastic nanoparticles effects in vitro, through cytotoxic readouts in mammalian cell culture, and in vivo, through behavioral readouts in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a powerful 3R-complying model organism for toxicology studies. In vitro experiments in neuroblastoma cells indicate a specific cytotoxic effect of PS-NH2 particles, including a decreased neuronal differentiation and an increased Amyloid β (Aβ) secretion, a sensitive readout correlating with Alzheimer's disease pathology. In parallel, only in vivo treatments with PS-NH2 particles affect C. elegans development, decrease lifespan, and reveal higher sensitivity of animals expressing human Aβ compared to wild-type animals.

The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques is a histopathological hallmark of AD and associated with increased astrocyte reactivity. In APP/PS1 mice modelling established AD (9 months), we now show an altered astrocytic morphology and enhanced activity of astrocytic hemichannels, mainly composed by connexin 43 (Cx43). Hemichannel activity in hippocampal astrocytes is also increased in two models of early AD: (1) mice with intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of Aβ1-42, and (2) hippocampal slices superfused with Aβ1-42 peptides. In hippocampal gliosomes of APP/PS1 mice, Cx43 levels were increased, whereas mice administered icv with Aβ1-42 only displayed increased Cx43 phosphorylation levels. This suggests that hemichannel activity might be differentially modulated throughout AD progression. Additionally, we tested if adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) blockade reversed alterations of astrocytic hemichannel activity and found that the pharmacological blockade or genetic silencing (global and astrocytic) of A2AR prevented Aβ-induced hemichannel dysregulation in hippocampal slices, although A2AR genetic silencing increased the activity of astroglial hemichannels in control conditions. In primary cultures of astrocytes, A2AR-related protective effect was shown to occur through a protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Our results indicate that the dysfunction of hemichannel activity in hippocampal astrocytes is an early event in AD, which is modulated by A2AR.\",\n",

The MetS constitutes elevated fasting glucose, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension and increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, but the precise mechanism remains elusive. Insulin resistance, which develops from a diet rich in sugars and saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, is shared by the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are also a point of convergence, with altered dynamics in both the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of palmitate- and glucose-induced insulin resistance in the brain and its potential link through EVs to Alzheimer's disease is unknown. We demonstrate that palmitate and high glucose induce insulin resistance and amyloid precursor protein phosphorylation in primary rat embryonic cortical neurons and human cortical stem cells. Palmitate also triggers insulin resistance in oligodendrocytes, the supportive glia of the brain. Palmitate and glucose enhance amyloid precursor protein secretion from cortical neurons via EVs, which induce tau phosphorylation when added to naïve neurons. Additionally, EVs from palmitate-treated oligodendrocytes enhance insulin resistance in recipient neurons. Overall, our findings suggest a novel theory underlying the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in MetS mediated by EVs, which spread Alzheimer's pathology and insulin resistance.\",\n",

There is a long history of investigations regarding the inhibition of CETP as a target for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Initially, the potential effect on cardiovascular events of CETP inhibitors was hypothesized to be mediated by their ability to increase HDL cholesterol, but, based on evidence from anacetrapib and the newest CETP inhibitor, obicetrapib, it is now understood to be primarily due to reducing LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Nevertheless, evidence is also mounting that other roles of HDL, including its promotion of cholesterol efflux, as well as its apolipoprotein composition and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-diabetic properties, may play important roles in several diseases beyond cardiovascular disease, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and sepsis. Furthermore, although Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that higher HDL cholesterol is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), excess risk of AMD was absent in all CETP inhibitor randomized controlled trial data comprising over 70,000 patients. In fact, certain HDL subclasses may, in contrast, be beneficial for treating the retinal cholesterol accumulation that occurs with AMD.

Neuron-specific drebrin A is highly enriched in dendritic spines (postsynaptic terminals) of mature excitatory neurons. Decreased levels of drebrin in dendritic spines is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and other complex disorders, which calls for better understanding of its regulatory functions. Drebrin A was previously shown to inhibit actin nucleation and bundling by the diaphanous formin-2 (mDia2) - an actin nucleator that is involved in the initiation of dendritic spines. Characterization of the molecular binding interface between mDia2 and drebrin is necessary to better understand the functional consequences of this interaction and its biological relevance. Prior work suggested a multi-pronged interface between mDia2 and drebrin, which involves both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the drebrin molecule. Here we used mass spectrometry analysis, deletion mutagenesis, and an array of synthetic peptides of neuronal drebrin A to map its formin-binding interface. The mDia2-interacting interface on drebrin was narrowed down to three highly conserved 9-16 residue sequences that were used to identify some of the key residues involved in this interaction. Deletion of the C-terminal region of drebrin greatly reduces its binding to mDia2 and the extent of its inhibition of formin-driven actin assembly. Moreover, our experiments with formins from different subfamilies showed that drebrin is a specific rather than general inhibitor of these proteins. This work contributes to a molecular level understanding of the formin-drebrin interaction and will help to unravel its biological significance.\",\n",

The overarching objectives of the CLIC group are to: (1) understand the age-related physiology changes that underlie impaired clearance of interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (CLIC); (2) understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying intramural periarterial drainage (IPAD) in the brain; (3) establish novel diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), retinal amyloid vasculopathy, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) of spontaneous and iatrogenic CAA-related inflammation (CAA-ri), and vasomotion; and (4) establish novel therapies that facilitate IPAD to eliminate amyloid β (Aβ) from the aging brain and retina, to prevent or reduce AD and CAA pathology and ARIA side events associated with AD immunotherapy.\",\n",
