        "AbstractText": "The workload associated with caring for a person with dementia (PwD) could negatively affect informal caregivers' physical and mental health. According to the recent literature, there is a need for studies testing the implementation of affordable and accessible interventions for improving caregivers' well-being. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of an 8\u00a0week eHealth psychoeducation intervention held during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy in reducing the psychological burden and neuroendocrine markers of stress in caregivers of PwD. Forty-one informal caregivers of PwD completed the eHealth psychoeducation intervention. Self-reported (i.e., caregiver burden, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and caregiver self-efficacy) and cortisol measurements were collected before and after the intervention. Following the intervention, the caregivers' self-efficacy regarding the ability to respond to disruptive behaviours improved (t\u2009=\u2009-\u00a02.817, p\u2009=\u20090.007), anxiety and burden levels decreased (state anxiety: t\u2009=\u20093.170, p\u2009=\u20090.003; trait anxiety: t\u2009=\u20092.327, p\u2009=\u20090.025; caregiver burden: t\u2009=\u20092.290, p\u2009=\u20090.027), while depressive symptoms and cortisol levels did not change significantly. Correlation analyses showed that the increase in self-efficacy was positively associated with the improvement of caregiver burden from pre- to post-intervention (r\u2009=\u20090.386, p\u2009=\u20090.014). The intervention had a low rate of dropout (n\u2009=\u20091, due to the patient's death) and high levels of appreciation. The positive evidence and participation rate support the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed eHealth psychoeducational intervention to meet the need for knowledge of disease management and possibly reduce detrimental effects on caregivers' psychological well-being. Further placebo-controlled trials are needed to test the generalizability and specificity of our results.",

        "AbstractText": "Reliable detection of disease-specific atrophy in individual T1w-MRI by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) requires scanner-specific normal databases (NDB), which often are not available. The aim of this retrospective study was to design, train, and test a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for single-subject VBM without the need for a NDB (CNN-VBM). The training dataset comprised 8945 T1w scans from 65 different scanners. The gold standard VBM maps were obtained by conventional VBM with a scanner-specific NDB for each of the 65 scanners. CNN-VBM was tested in an independent dataset comprising healthy controls (n = 37) and subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 51) or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD, n = 30). A scanner-specific NDB for the generation of the gold standard VBM maps was available also for the test set. The technical performance of CNN-VBM was characterized by the Dice coefficient of CNN-VBM maps relative to VBM maps from scanner-specific VBM. For clinical testing, VBM maps were categorized visually according to the clinical diagnoses in the test set by two independent readers, separately for both VBM methods. The VBM maps from CNN-VBM were similar to the scanner-specific VBM maps (median Dice coefficient 0.85, interquartile range [0.81, 0.90]). Overall accuracy of the visual categorization of the VBM maps for the detection of AD or FTLD was 89.8% for CNN-VBM and 89.0% for scanner-specific VBM. CNN-VBM without NDB provides a similar performance in the detection of AD- and FTLD-specific atrophy as conventional VBM. A deep convolutional neural network for voxel-based morphometry eliminates the need of scanner-specific normal databases without relevant performance loss and, therefore, could pave the way for the widespread clinical use of voxel-based morphometry to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. \u2022 The need of normal databases is a barrier for widespread use of voxel-based brain morphometry. \u2022 A convolutional neural network achieved a similar performance for detection of atrophy than conventional voxel-based morphometry. \u2022 Convolutional neural networks can pave the way for widespread clinical use of voxel-based morphometry.",

The present review provides a pharmacological update on MTZ and summarizes the research findings of MTZ's effects on different diseases. MTZ is hypothesized to have antidepressant effects because of the synergy between noradrenergic and serotonergic actions and is effective in treating major depressive disorder and depression associated with epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. In cancer patients, MTZ significantly reduced sadness, nausea, sleep disruption, and pain and improved quality of life. Also, it has promising effects on Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, dysthymia, social anxiety disorder, alcohol dependency, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, pain syndromes, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and sleep disorders. Additionally, MTZ is potentially therapeutic in different situations associated with depression, such as liver, kidney, cardiovascular, respiratory, infertility, heavy metal-induced neurotoxicity, and pruritus. Potent antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic bioactivities mediate these promising effects. These positive outcomes of the scientific investigations motivate more and more clinical trials for a golden exceptional antidepressant in different conditions.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with memory decline and cognitive impairment, which is related to hallmark protein aggregates, amyloid-\u03b2 (\u0410\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles; the latter are accumulated with hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Immune cells play an important role in AD pathogenesis. Although the role of T cells in AD remains controversial, studies have shown that T cell deficiency is associated with increased AD pathology. In contrast, transplantation of T cells reduces AD pathology. T cells can help B cells generate anti-\u0410\u03b2 antibody to neutralize the toxin of \u0410\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated Tau. T cells also activate macrophages to phagocytose misfolded proteins including \u0410\u03b2 and Tau. Recent data have also shown that AD animals have a damaged thymic microenvironment, especially thymic epithelial cells (TECs), resulting in decreased T cell numbers, which contribute to AD pathology. Therefore, regulation of T cell regeneration, for example by rejuvenating the thymic microenvironment, has the potential to be used in the treatment of AD.",

A systematic review was conducted by searching the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed databases covering publications from January 2000 to February 2023. The search was performed using the keyword &quot;Alzheimer* AND (gustatory OR taste OR gustation).&quot; Only studies that performed gustatory function testing and compared the results between patients with AD and healthy controls were included. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Twelve articles were finally included, and various gustatory tests including taste strips, the taste disk test, taste solutions, and subjective questionnaires were applied. Overall gustatory function based on the taste strip test was significantly decreased in patients with AD compared with controls in two out of three papers. The overall gustatory function of patients with AD was significantly decreased in all studies based on the taste disk and taste solution tests. We also found that the sweet taste test showed low heterogeneity across all the included studies, and there was low publication bias. In studies using subjective questionnaires, gustatory function was not significantly different between patients with AD and healthy controls in the meta-analysis. Based on these studies, gustatory dysfunction diagnosed by gustatory function testing was closely related to AD. However, the results of subjective questionnaires were not significantly different between patients with AD and healthy controls in the current meta-analysis. As the number of studies and enrolled subjects was limited and unified gustatory function testing was lacking, further studies are needed to confirm this relationship.",

        "AbstractText": "Good sleep is correlated with health. Primary insomnia is a common reason for consulting a primary care physician. It is usually treated with drugs despite clear evidence for the efficacy of behavioral therapy. We conducted a selective search of PubMed for German- and English-language reviews of the past decade that deal with the function and regulation of sleep in healthy individuals and/or the mechanism of action of currently used drugs and behavioral therapy. The important functions of sleep include cleaning processes such as the elimination of metabolic products, e.g., amyloid, via the glymphatic system; consolidation of memory; and anabolic regulation of metabolism. Osteoporosis, which affects 10.5% of post-menopausal women, is much more common in those who have insomnia (odds ratio 9.3, 95% confidence interval [2.9; 29.6]). Among 82-year-old persons in good cognitive health, 13% of those who sleep best will go on to develop Alzheimer's disease, compared to 20% of those who sleep worst. Hypnotic drugs and behavioral therapy can each prolong sleep by approximately 30 minutes. Drugs alter the architecture and function of sleep and have unfavorable consequences, such as a higher rate of falls (healthy individuals: 24.8 per 1000 person-years; persons with insomnia, 27.5; persons taking hypnotic drugs for insomnia, 33.0). Behavioral therapy is resource-intensive and requires the patient's adherence, yet it has been demonstrated to be effective over the long term and is the treatment of choice. Behavioral therapy is underused despite clear evidence of efficacy, while drugs are given too often. Better patient education and the use of digital applications might help increase the utilization of behavioral therapy for insomnia.",

The objective of this study was to investigate whether different types of dietary fiber elicited specific changes in gut microbiota composition and the production of short-chain fatty acids. To test this, a longitudinal crossover study design was employed, in which healthy adult women consumed three distinct dietary fiber supplements: Inulin (fructo-oligosaccharide), Vitafiber (isomalto-oligosaccharide), and Fibremax (mixture of different fiber) during a one-week intervention period, followed by a 2-week washout period. A total of 15\u2009g of soluble fiber was consumed daily for each supplement. Samples were collected before and after each intervention to analyze the composition of the gut microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing and fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids measured using nuclear magnetic resonance. Phenotypic changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were studied in subsets of participants with higher SCFA levels post-intervention using spectral flow cytometry. The results revealed substantial stability and resilience of the overall gut bacterial community toward fiber-induced changes. However, each supplement had specific effects on gut bacterial alpha and beta diversity, SCFA production, and immune changes. Inulin consistently exerted the most pronounced effect across individuals and certain taxa were identified as potential indicators of SCFA production in response to inulin supplementation. This distinguishing feature was not observed for the other fiber supplements. Further large-scale studies are required to confirm these findings. Overall, our study implies that personalized dietary fiber intervention could be tailored to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria to maximize SCFA production and associated health benefits.",

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, DOAJ, and Scopus for animal research and English language papers without time constraints. This study used the PRISMA-P framework and PICO technique to collect population, intervention or exposure, comparison, and result data. It was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42022371502. MSG affected mice's exploratory behaviors and short-term working memory. The brain, hippocampus, and cerebellar tissue demonstrated neuronal injury-related histological and histomorphometric changes. A total of 70% of MSG-treated mice had poor nesting behavior. The treated mice also had more hyperphosphorylated tau protein in their cortical and hippocampus neurons. Glutamate and glutamine levels in the brain increased with MSG, and dose-dependent mixed horizontal locomotor, grooming, and anxiety responses reduced. MSG treatment significantly decreased phospho-CREB protein levels, supporting the idea that neurons were harmed, despite the increased CREB mRNA expression. High MSG doses drastically lower brain tissue and serum serotonin levels. In conclusion, MSG showed AD-like pathology, neuronal atrophy, and short-term memory impairment.

        "ArticleTitle": "Primary cilia-mediated regulation of microglial secretion in Alzheimer's disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain disorder manifested by a gradual decline in cognitive function due to the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, disruptions in neuronal substance transport, and the degeneration of neurons. In affected neurons, incomplete clearance of toxic proteins by neighboring microglia leads to irreversible brain inflammation, for which cellular signaling is poorly understood. Through single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we discovered distinct regional differences in the ability of microglia to clear damaged neurites. Specifically, microglia in the septal region of wild type mice exhibited a transcriptomic signature resembling disease-associated microglia (DAM). These lateral septum (LS)-enriched microglia were associated with dense axonal bundles originating from the hippocampus. Further transcriptomic and proteomic approaches revealed that primary cilia, small hair-like structures found on cells, played a role in the regulation of microglial secretory function. Notably, primary cilia were transiently observed in microglia, and their presence was significantly reduced in microglia from AD mice. We observed significant changes in the secretion and proteomic profiles of the secretome after inhibiting the primary cilia gene intraflagellar transport particle 88 (Ift88) in microglia. Intriguingly, inhibiting primary cilia in the septal microglia of AD mice resulted in the expansion of extracellular amyloid plaques and damage to adjacent neurites. These results indicate that DAM-like microglia are present in the LS, a critical target region for hippocampal nerve bundles, and that the primary ciliary signaling system regulates microglial secretion, affecting extracellular proteostasis. Age-related primary ciliopathy probably contributes to the selective sensitivity of microglia, thereby exacerbating AD. Targeting the primary ciliary signaling system could therefore be a viable strategy for modulating neuroimmune responses in AD treatments.",

In linear regression analyses, LIBRA (p\u2009<\u20090.05), MoPaRDS (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and pPREDICT (p\u2009<\u20090.05) predicted change in CCS. Only age stratified by sex (p\u2009<\u20090.05) contributed significantly to the model for LIBRA. Age and presence of hallucinations (p\u2009<\u20090.05) contributed significantly to the model for MoPaRDS. Male sex, older age, excessive daytime sleepiness, and moderate-severe motor symptoms (all p\u2009<\u20090.05) contributed significantly to the model for pPREDICT. Although MoPaRDS is a PD-specific tool for predicting cognitive decline relying on only clinical features, it does not focus on potentially modifiable risk factors. LIBRA does focus on potentially modifiable risk factors and is associated with prediction of all-cause dementia in some populations, but pPREDICT potentially demonstrates improved performance in cognitive decline risk calculation in individuals with PD and may identify actionable risk factors. As pPREDICT incorporates multiple potentially modifiable risk factors that can be obtained easily in the clinical setting, it is a first step in developing an easily assessable tool for a personalized approach to reduce dementia risk in people with PD.",

The extent to which dominantly inherited and sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease overlap is unknown. In this study, we explored the clinical, cognitive and biomarker profiles of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, focusing on commonalities and distinctions between dominantly inherited and sporadic cases. Our analysis included 117 participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and 118 individuals with sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease enrolled at the University of California San Francisco Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Baseline differences in clinical and biomarker profiles between both groups were compared using t-tests. Differences in the rates of decline were compared using linear mixed-effects models. Individuals with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease exhibited an earlier age-at-symptom onset compared with the sporadic group [43.4 (SD \u00b1 8.5) years versus 54.8 (SD \u00b1 5.0) years, respectively, P < 0.001]. Sporadic cases showed a higher frequency of atypical clinical presentations relative to dominantly inherited (56.8% versus 8.5%, respectively) and a higher frequency of APOE-\u03b54 (50.0% versus 28.2%, P = 0.001). Compared with sporadic early onset, motor manifestations were higher in the dominantly inherited cohort [32.5% versus 16.9% at baseline (P = 0.006) and 46.1% versus 25.4% at last visit (P = 0.001)]. At baseline, the sporadic early-onset group performed worse on category fluency (P < 0.001), Trail Making Test Part B (P < 0.001) and digit span (P < 0.001). Longitudinally, both groups demonstrated similar rates of cognitive and functional decline in the early stages. After 10 years from symptom onset, dominantly inherited participants experienced a greater decline as measured by Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes [3.63 versus 1.82 points (P = 0.035)]. CSF amyloid beta-42 levels were comparable [244 (SD \u00b1 39.3) pg/ml dominantly inherited versus 296 (SD \u00b1 24.8) pg/ml sporadic early onset, P = 0.06]. CSF phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 levels were higher in the dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease cohort (87.3 versus 59.7\u2005pg/ml, P = 0.005), but no significant differences were found for t-tau levels (P = 0.35). In summary, sporadic and inherited Alzheimer's disease differed in baseline profiles; sporadic early onset is best distinguished from dominantly inherited by later age at onset, high frequency of atypical clinical presentations and worse executive performance at baseline. Despite these differences, shared pathways in longitudinal clinical decline and CSF biomarkers suggest potential common therapeutic targets for both populations, offering valuable insights for future research and clinical trial design.",

Mutations in TREM2 are strongly linked with a higher risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. There have been contradictory findings regarding the potential detrimental or protective effects of microglial activation and TREM2-related microglial responses in Alzheimer's disease. Although previous studies reported increased CSF soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in different clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, the exact association between Alzheimer's disease hallmarks such as amyloid-beta and tau pathology remains unclear. In the present study, I aimed to investigate the association between TREM2-related microglial responses and tau accumulation in the presence and absence of amyloid-beta pathology in order to give a better view of the role of microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease development. Imaging data of 178 non-demented participants including 107 amyloid-beta-negative participants, 71 amyloid-beta-positive were recruited from Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The CSF sTREM2 was used as an in vivo indicator of microglial responses associated with TREM2. Furthermore, I used longitudinal tau-PET and resting-state functional MRI connectomes in order to investigate the association of TREM2-related microglial activation and tau spreading through functional connections. A higher level of sTREM2 was associated with slower tau aggregate accumulation in non-demented amyloid-beta-positive. Furthermore, measuring the tau spreading through inter-connected regions using functional MRI connectomes confirms that the TREM2-related microglial activity might be a protective factor against tau pathology in brain tissue. These findings demonstrate that in individuals with initial amyloid-beta abnormalities, TREM2-related microglial activation is linked to reduced regional accumulation of tau aggregates and also, spreading across inter-connected brain regions, as evaluated through functional MRI connectomes during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.",

Finally, delayed recall scores significantly predicted relative differences in the SW group in the alpha band (t\u2009=\u2009\u22122.98, p\u2009=\u20090.009). Given that network studies could corroborate the results of previous power spectrum studies, our findings contribute to a multifaceted understanding of functional brain networks in AD, emphasizing that the SW properties of these networks change according to disease status, cognitive function, and experimental conditions.",

        "AbstractText": "Forkhead box O (FoxO) proteins are transcription factors that mediate many aspects of physiology and thus have been targeted as therapeutics for several diseases including metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The role of FoxO1 in metabolism has been well studied, but recently FoxO1's potential for diabetes prevention and therapy has been debated. For example, studies have shown that increased FoxO1 activity in certain tissue types contributes to T2D pathology, symptoms, and comorbidities, yet in other tissue types elevated FoxO1 has been reported to alleviate symptoms associated with diabetes. Furthermore, studies have reported opposite effects of active FoxO1 in the same tissue type. For example, in the liver, FoxO1 contributes to T2D by increasing hepatic glucose production. However, FoxO1 has been shown to either increase or decrease hepatic lipogenesis as well as adipogenesis in white adipose tissue. In skeletal muscle, FoxO1 reduces glucose uptake and oxidation, promotes lipid uptake and oxidation, and increases muscle atrophy. While many studies show that FoxO1 lowers pancreatic insulin production and secretion, others show the opposite, especially in response to oxidative stress and inflammation. Elevated FoxO1 in the hypothalamus increases the risk of developing T2D. However, increased FoxO1 may mitigate Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease strongly associated with T2D. Conversely, accumulating evidence implicates increased FoxO1 with Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Here we review FoxO1's actions in T2D conditions in metabolic tissues that abundantly express FoxO1 and highlight some of the current studies targeting FoxO1 for T2D treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Care partners of persons living with dementia perform complex legal planning tasks. The purpose of this study was to survey care partners in the United States to understand their confidence and experience in performing legal planning tasks. This study used a parallel-mixed methods research design. We administered a web-based survey to 318 adults who self-identified as care partners of persons living with dementia. The survey contained Likert scale questions and open-ended questions about legal planning tasks. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze quantitative data and inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Care partners were on average 53 years of age and 78% female. The three topics in which participants were least confident were: protecting oneself legally as a care partner; options when legal documents are not in place and a family member is not legally competent; and circumstances when legal documents should be updated or renewed. We observed significant differences in legal planning confidence between newer and more experienced care partners (p<.001); lower- and higher-income care partners (p=.01); and adult child versus spousal care partners (p<.001). Thematic analysis revealed that legal planning challenges include initiating a conversation with the person living with dementia, understanding and using legal materials, and accessing materials that accommodate individual differences. It is vital to develop legal planning interventions that are tailored to specific subgroups of care partners, and to maximize the clarity, comprehensiveness, and accessibility of available legal planning education.",

After a computer literacy training led by high school students, participants engaged in remotely supervised OCY or CBG in twice-weekly 45-minute sessions for 12\u2009weeks. Outcome data (pain interference, cognitive function, mobility, computer skills) were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. A total of 32 eligible residents with mean age of 71\u2009years participated in this intervention study. The interventions were feasible (100% recruitment rate, 96.8% retention rate, 100% safety rate). There were significant improvements in pain interference, cognitive function, mobility, and computer skills from baseline to follow-up among participants in both OCY and CBG but no significant differences in outcomes between groups. Preliminary results indicated that the CBG was as effective as online OCY in clinical outcomes in these participants. However, this should be confirmed in future studies. This telehealth-based intervention is feasible for older adults in rural and digitally underserved communities and could provide a strategy for delivering health-promoting interventions for home-bound older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and connect caregivers to online resources.",

A growing number of single-cell studies have implicated various neural, glial, and immune cell subtypes to affect the mammalian central nervous system in many age-related disorders. Integrating this body of transcriptomic evidence into a comprehensive and reproducible framework poses several computational challenges. Here, we introduce ZEBRA, a large single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq database. ZEBRA integrates and normalizes gene expression and metadata from 33 studies, encompassing 4.2 million human and mouse brain cells sampled from 39 brain regions. It incorporates samples from patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple sclerosis, as well as samples from relevant mouse models. We employed scVI, a deep probabilistic auto-encoder model, to integrate the samples and curated both cell and sample metadata for downstream analysis. ZEBRA allows for cell-type and disease-specific markers to be explored and compared between sample conditions and brain regions, a cell composition analysis, and gene-wise feature mappings. Our comprehensive molecular database facilitates the generation of data-driven hypotheses, enhancing our understanding of mammalian brain function during aging and disease.

        "AbstractText": "DNA sensing is a pivotal component of the innate immune system that is responsible for detecting mislocalized DNA and triggering downstream inflammatory pathways. Among the DNA sensors, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a primary player in detecting cytosolic DNA, including foreign DNA from pathogens and self-DNA released during cellular damage, culminating in a type I interferon (IFN-I) response through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation. IFN-I cytokines are essential in mediating neuroinflammation, which is widely observed in CNS injury, neurodegeneration, and aging, suggesting an upstream role for the cGAS DNA sensing pathway. In this review, we summarize the latest developments on the cGAS-STING DNA-driven immune response in various neurological diseases and conditions. Our review covers the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cGAS activation and highlights cGAS-STING signaling in various cell types of central and peripheral nervous systems, such as resident brain immune cells, neurons, and glial cells. We then discuss the role of cGAS-STING signaling in different neurodegenerative conditions, including tauopathies, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as aging and senescence. Finally, we lay out the current advancements in research and development of cGAS inhibitors and assess the prospects of targeting cGAS and STING as therapeutic strategies for a wide spectrum of neurological diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Peptides and their mimetics are increasingly recognised as drug-like molecules, particularly for intracellular protein-protein interactions too large for inhibition by small molecules, and inaccessible to larger biologics. In the past two decades, evidence associating the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein strongly implicates this protein in disease onset and progression of Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. The subsequent formation of toxic, intracellular, Lewy body deposits, in which alpha-synuclein is a major component, is a key diagnostic hallmark of the disease. To reach their therapeutic site of action, peptides must both cross the blood-brain barrier and enter dopaminergic neurons to prevent the formation of these intracellular inclusions. In this review, we describe and summarise the current efforts made in the development of peptides and their mimetics to directly engage with alpha-synuclein with the intention of modulating aggregation, and importantly, toxicity. This is a rapidly expanding field with great socioeconomic impact; these molecules harbour significant promise as therapeutics, or as early biomarkers during prodromal disease stages, or both. As these are age-dependent conditions, an increasing global life expectancy means disease prevalence is rising. No current treatments exist to either prevent or slow disease progression. It is therefore crucial that drugs are developed for these conditions before health care and social care capacities become overrun.",

        "AbstractText": "Sleep disturbance is a recognized risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying micro-pathological evidence remains limited. To bridge this gap, we established an amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2O)-induced rat model of AD and subjected it to intermittent sleep deprivation (SD). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transmission electron microscopy were employed to assess white matter (WM) integrity and ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths. Our findings demonstrated that SD exacerbated A\u03b2O-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, we found SD aggravated A\u03b2O-induced asymmetrical impairments in WM, presenting with reductions in tract integrity observed in commissural fibers and association fasciculi, particularly the right anterior commissure, right corpus callosum, and left cingulum. Ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths within the hippocampus and corpus callosum further confirmed a lateralized effect. Moreover, SD worsened A\u03b2O-induced lateralized disruption of the brain structural network, with impairments in critical nodes of the left hemisphere strongly correlated with cognitive dysfunction. This work represents the first identification of a lateralized impact of SD on the mesoscopic network and cognitive deficits in an AD rat model. These findings could deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between sleep disturbance and AD pathology, providing valuable insights into the early progression of the disease, as well as the development of neuroimaging biomarkers for screening early AD patients with self-reported sleep disturbances. Enhanced understanding of these mechanisms may pave the way for targeted interventions to alleviate cognitive decline and improve the quality of life for individuals at risk of or affected by AD. a\u00a0A\u03b2O injection and sleep deprivation were conducted on adult rats. b Sleep deprivation and A\u03b2O-induced neurotoxicity aggravated cognitive disability with a synergistic effect. c Sleep deprivation and A\u03b2O-induced neurotoxicity reduced the integrity of specific association fasciculi and commissural fibers with ultrastructural demyelination. d On the basis of white matter integrity destruction, the structural connection was disrupted.

We used weight gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to evaluate the relations among co-expression modules and construct global regulatory network. Cross-talking pathways of RAF-1 in AD were identified by functional enrichment analysis. Totally, 2700 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected between AD versus non-dementia control and RAF-1-high versus low group. Among them, DEGs in turquoise module strongly associated with AD and high expression of RAF-1 were enriched in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neurotrophin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, GABAergic synapse, and axon guidance. Moreover, cross-talking pathways of RAF-1, including MAPK, VEGF, neurotrophin signaling pathways, and axon guidance, were identified by global regulatory network. The performance evaluation of AUC was 84.2%. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that oxidative phosphorylation and synapse-related biological processes were enriched in RAF-1-high and AD group.

Here, we review the current knowledge about neuritic plaques, a subset of A\u03b2 plaques surrounded by swollen or dystrophic neurites, which represent the most detrimental and consequential A\u03b2 plaque morphology. Neuritic plaques have been associated with local immune activation, neuronal network dysfunction, and cognitive decline.

T1-weighted anatomical images from 3.0\u2009T magnetic resonance imaging data were collected and processed using the BRAINSTools toolbox. Dim light melatonin onset was used to assess circadian timing. The area under the curve was calculated to quantify melatonin concentration levels 6\u2009hr before bedtime, and 14-day wrist actigraphy data were used to assess habitual bedtime. Multiple linear regression modelling with hippocampal volume as the dependent variable was used to analyse the data adjusting for age and sex. The average dim light melatonin onset was 19:45\u2005hours (SD\u2009=\u200984\u2009min), and area under the curve of melatonin levels 6\u2009hr before habitual bedtime was 38.4\u2009pg\u2005ml-1 \u2009\u00d7\u2009hr (SD\u2009=\u200929.3).

Although transient interventions provided benefits in some brain parameters in D-galactose-treated rats, an improvement in cognitive function was not observed. Our findings suggested that transient lifestyle interventions failed to exert a long-lasting protective effect against brain aging.

Emerging evidence, mostly from cell and animal models of disease, supports a role for ketosis in general, and the main circulating ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in particular, in reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation to ameliorate chronic inflammation. As a result, interventions that can induce ketosis (e.g., fasting, intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding/eating, very low-carbohydrate high-fat ketogenic diets) and/or increase circulating BHB (e.g., exogenous ketone supplementation) have garnered increasing interest for their therapeutic potential. The purpose of the present review is to summarize our current understanding of the literature on how ketogenic interventions impact the NLRP3 inflammasome across human, rodent and cell models. Overall, there is convincing evidence that ketogenic interventions, likely acting through multiple interacting mechanisms in a cell-, disease- and context-specific manner, can reduce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The evidence supports a direct effect of BHB, although it is important to consider the myriad of other metabolic responses to fasting or ketogenic diet interventions (e.g., elevated lipolysis, low insulin, stable glucose, negative energy balance) that may also impact innate immune responses.

T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI is a widely used technique to measure global Yv level and has been validated against gold-standard PET. However, subject motion during TRUST MRI scan can introduce considerable errors in Yv quantification, especially for noncompliant subjects. The aim of this study was to develop an Automatic Rejection based on Tissue Signal (ARTS) algorithm for automatic detection and exclusion of motion-contaminated images to improve the precision of Yv quantification. TRUST MRI data were collected from a neonatal cohort (N\u202f=\u202f37, 16 females, gestational age\u202f=\u202f39.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.11\u202fweeks, postnatal age\u202f=\u202f1.89\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.74\u202fdays) and an older adult cohort (N\u202f=\u202f223, 134 females, age\u202f=\u202f68.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.01\u202fyears). Manual identification of motion-corrupted images was conducted for both cohorts to serve as a gold-standard. 9.3% of the images in the neonatal datasets and 0.4% of the images in the older adult datasets were manually identified as motion-contaminated. The ARTS algorithm was trained using the neonatal datasets. TRUST Yv values, as well as the estimation uncertainty (\u0394R2) and test-retest coefficient-of-variation (CoV) of Yv, were calculated with and without ARTS motion exclusion. The ARTS algorithm was tested on datasets of older adults: first on the original adult datasets with little motion, and then on simulated adult datasets where the percentage of motion-corrupted images matched that of the neonatal datasets.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, characterized by early memory impairments and gradual worsening of daily functions. AD-related pathology, such as amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques, begins to accumulate many years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Predicting risk for AD via related pathology is critical as the preclinical stage could serve as a therapeutic time window, allowing for early management of the disease and reducing health and economic costs. Current methods for detecting AD pathology, however, are often expensive and invasive, limiting wide and easy access to a clinical setting. A non-invasive, cost-efficient platform, such as computerized cognitive tests, could be potentially useful to identify at-risk individuals as early as possible. In this study, we examined the diagnostic value of an episodic memory task, the mnemonic discrimination task (MDT), for predicting risk of cognitive impairment or A\u03b2 burden. We constructed a random forest classification algorithm, utilizing MDT performance metrics and various neuropsychological test scores as input features, and assessed model performance using area under the curve (AUC). Models based on MDT performance metrics achieved classification results with an AUC of 0.83 for cognitive status and an AUC of 0.64 for A\u03b2 status. Our findings suggest that mnemonic discrimination function may be a useful predictor of progression to prodromal AD or increased risk of A\u03b2 load, which could be a cost-efficient, noninvasive cognitive testing solution for potentially wide-scale assessment of AD pathological and cognitive risk.",

        "AbstractText": "\u03b1B-Crystallin (\u03b1B-Cry) is expressed in many tissues, and mutations in this protein are linked to various diseases, including cataracts, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and several types of myopathies and cardiomyopathies. The p.D109G mutation, which substitutes a conserved aspartate residue involved in the interchain salt bridges, with glycine leads to the development of both restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) and skeletal myopathy. In this study, we generated this mutation in the \u03b1-Cry domain (ACD) which is crucial for forming the active chaperone dimeric state, using site-directed mutagenesis. After inducing expression in the bacterial host, we purified the mutant and wild-type recombinant proteins using anion exchange chromatography. Various spectroscopic evaluations revealed significant changes in the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of human \u03b1B-Cry caused by this mutation. Furthermore, this pathogenic mutation led to the formation of protein oligomers with larger sizes than those of the wild-type protein counterpart. The mutant protein also exhibited increased chaperone activity and decreased chemical, thermal, and proteolytic stability. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and fluorescence microscopy (FM) demonstrated that p.D109G mutant protein is more prone to forming amyloid aggregates. The misfolding associated with the p.D109G mutation may result in abnormal interactions of human \u03b1B-Cry with its natural partners (e.g., desmin), leading to the formation of protein aggregates. These aggregates can interfere with normal cellular processes and may contribute to muscle cell dysfunction and damage, resulting in the pathogenic involvement of the p.D109G mutant protein in restrictive cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy.",

Patients with LBD (n\u00a0=\u00a016), PD (PD, n\u00a0=\u00a014) or iRBD (n\u00a0=\u00a012) were compared to the non-synucleinopathy groups Alzheimers disease dementia (ADem, n\u00a0=\u00a026), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n\u00a0=\u00a034) or controls (CG, n\u00a0=\u00a054).

Analysis included statistical group comparisons and receiver operating characteristics curves to determine optimal classification of groups. AAI and PR-CV were moderately correlated across all recordings (rs\u00a0=\u00a00.58, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), except in the LBD and PD groups. AAI but not PR-CV differentiated the LBD, PD and iRBD from non-Parkinsonian groups. AAI was decreased in LBD and PD patients compared to the CG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.003) and MCI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.03). AAI decreased based on age and its receiver operating characteristic area under the curve ranged from 0.63 to 0.75. AAI had a weak negative correlation to NRH (rs \u2264 -0.26) but not sleep-spindles. Synucleinopathy-related ANS dysfunction can reasonably discriminate prodromal and manifest PD/LBD diseased groups from non-synucleinopathies.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that commonly occurs in older people. It is characterized by both cognitive and functional impairment. However, as AD has an unclear pathological cause, it can be hard to diagnose with confidence. This is even more so in the early stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This paper proposes a U-Net based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) from magnetic resonance imaging - T1 weighted imaging (MRI-T1WI) for further usage in AD diagnosis including its early-stage MCI. The experiments have displayed promising results with Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) reaching 0.9714. Furthermore, three types of classifiers are developed, i.e., one Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier, two Graph Neural Network (GNN) based classifiers where one is for graph classification and the other is for node classification. 10-fold cross-validation has been conducted on all trials of experiments for classifier comparison. The performance of these three types of classifiers has been compared with the different input modalities setting and data fusion strategies. The results have shown that GNN based node classifier surpasses the other two types of classifiers, and has achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with the best accuracy at 90.18% for 3-class classification, namely AD, MCI and normal control (NC) with the synthesized fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) features fused at the input level. Moreover, involving synthesized FDG-PET as part of the input with proper data fusion strategies has also proved to enhance all three types of classifiers' performance. This work provides support for the notion that machine learning-derived image analysis may be a useful approach to improving the diagnosis of AD.",

The combination of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and caspase-3 will provide an effective treatment option for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To overcome the multiple physiological barriers and improve the therapeutic efficacy of siRNAs, lesion-recognizing nanoparticles (NPs) are constructed in this study for the synergistic treatment of AD. The lesion-recognizing NPs contain rabies virus glycoprotein peptide-modified mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as the shell and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polymer loaded with siRNAs as the core. After intranasal administration, the lesion-recognizing NPs cross the nasal mucosa and migrate to the affected brain areas. Furthermore, the NPs recognize the target cells and fuse with the cell membranes of neurons. The cores of NPs directly enter into the cytoplasm and achieve the controlled release of siRNAs in a high-ROS environment to downregulate the level of BACE1 and caspase-3 to ameliorate neurologic injury. In addition, lesion-recognizing NPs can significantly reduce the number of reactive astrocytes. Lesion-recognizing NPs have a positive effect on regulating the phase of neurons and astrocytes, which results in better restoration of memory deficits in 3 \u00d7 Tg-AD mice. Therefore, this work provides a promising platform for neurodegenerative disease treatment.",

The Au-Cu alloy NPs were prepared via a co-reduction reaction, exhibiting excellent conductivity and catalytic activity. These properties remarkably enhanced the ECL of luminol, providing a suitable background for the sensing response. After the Au-Cu NPs were decorated on the surface of indium tin oxide glass using 3-amino-propyl trimethoxysilane, the antibody of p-tau217 was immobilized via dominant Au-N bonding to enable the biological specificity of the immunosensor. When p-tau217 specifically interacted with an antibody to form an immune complex on the sensing interface, the ECL signal of the sensor was considerably inhibited by the resulting giant biomolecular complex. This complex prevented luminol diffusion to the electrode surface and electron transfer. The resulting immunosensor showed remarkable sensitivity to p-tau217, with a wide linear detection range from 5 to 600 pg/mL. A detection limit of 0.56 pg/mL was achieved, with recoveries in human serum ranging from 92.3 to 109%. This ECL immunosensor demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity toward p-tau217, along with good reproducibility and stability, providing a new approach for clinical research on Alzheimer's disease.",

Multifunctional macromolecular structures play an important role in inhibiting the aggregate formation of amyloidogenic materials and thus are promising candidates with antiamyloidogenic characteristics for the development of next-generation therapeutics. In this study, we evaluate how small differences in the dendritic topology of these structures influence their antiamyloidogenic activity by the comparison of \"perfectly dendritic\" and \"pseudodendritic\" macromolecules, both decorated with mannose units. Their compactness, the position of surface units, and the size of glyco-architectures influence their antiamyloidogenic activity against A\u03b2 40, a major component of amyloid plaques. For the advanced analysis of the aggregation of the A\u03b2 peptide, we introduce asymmetric flow field flow fractionation as a suitable method for the quantification of large and delicate structures. This alternative method focuses on the quantification of complex aggregates of A\u03b2 40 and glycodendrimer/glyco-pseudodendrimer over different time intervals of incubation, showing a good correlation to ThT assay and CD spectroscopy results. Kinetic studies of the second-generation glyco-pseudodendrimer revealed maximum inhibition of A\u03b2 40 aggregates, verified with atomic force microscopy. The second-generation glyco-pseudodendrimer shows the best antiamyloidogenic properties confirming that macromolecular conformation in combination with optimal functional group distribution is the key to its performance.

Here, we used a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based computational approach and identified small molecule candidates that reduce the nuclear liquid-liquid phase separation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), an essential protein that undergoes phase transition in neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrated that the GCN-based deep learning algorithm is suitable for spatial information extraction from the molecular graph. Thus, this is a promising method to identify small molecule candidates with novel scaffolds. Furthermore, we validated that these candidates do not affect the normal splicing function of TDP-43. Taken together, a combination of an imaging-based screen and a GCN-based deep learning method dramatically improves the speed and accuracy of the compound screen for biomolecular condensates.",

We conducted a cross-sectional study with community-dwelling adults (n = 166) age range 18-93, using a survey to gather sociodemographics, beliefs, and AdvDir experiences. Multivariate logistic regression quantifies associations between selected covariates and AdvDir completion. We found that 36% of respondents had completed AdvDirs. The majority were comfortable discussing death (77%) and end-of-life care (84%) and recognized the importance of AdvDirs (79%). Age, education level, self-perceived health status, exposure to end-of-life planning, and the preference to limit treatment in potential future Alzheimer's scenarios significantly influenced AdvDir completion. In conclusion, the study highlights: (1) The need for age-specific, personalized AdvDir education initiatives, and (2) The necessity of intensified AdvDir awareness efforts, particularly for individuals favoring unlimited treatment in Alzheimer's or dementia scenarios.",

Herein, we report the design of a poly(thiourethane) (PTU) self-immolative polymer terminally caged with an acrylate moiety to trigger release of H2S in response to cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy), the most used and independent indicators of neurodegenerative diseases. The synthesized PTU polymer was then coated with the red-blood-cell (RBC) membrane in the presence of solubilizing agent to self-assemble into nanoparticles with enhanced stability and cytocompatibility. The Hcy/Cys mediated addition/cyclization chemistry actuated the biomimetic polymeric nanoparticles to disintegrate into carbonyl sulfide (COS), and finally convert into H2S via the ubiquitous carbonic anhydrase (CA). H2S released in a controlled manner exhibited a strong antioxidant ability to resist Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related oxidative stress factors in BV-2 cells, a neurodegenerative disease model in vitro. Thus, this work may provide an effective strategy to construct H2S donors that can degrade in response to a specific pathological microenvironment for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder. Mounting studies focus on the improvement of advanced cognitive impairment by dietary nutrients. Krill oil (KO), a rich source of DHA/EPA and astaxanthin, is effective in improving cognitive function. The study mainly investigates the protective effects of long-term KO administration on early cognitive impairment. Results show that 2 months KO administration (50 and 100\u00a0mg\u00a0kg-1 BW) can dramatically promote learning and memory abilities. Mechanism studies demonstrate that KO reduces amyloid \u03b2 concentration by regulating the amyloidogenic pathway, inhibits neuro-inflammation via regulating TLR4-NLRP3 signaling pathway, and prevents neuron injure. KO supplementation also enhances gut barrier integrity, reduces serum lipopolysaccharide leakage, and alters the gut microbiota by reducing Helicobacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae proportion, increasing Dubosiella and Akkermansia relative abundance. Particularly, a significant increase of isovaleric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid levels is observed after KO supplementation. Correlation analysis shows that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), gut microbiota, and cognitive function are strongly correlated. The results reveal that KO relieves early mild cognitive impairment possibly for its role in mediating the gut microbiome-SCFAs-brain axis. Thus, KO may provide potential intervention strategies to prevent cognitive impairment in the early stages through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

        "AbstractText": "Dementia is a cognitive disturbance that is generally correlated with central nervous system diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. The limited number of medications available is insufficient to improve the lifestyle of the patients suffering from this disease. Thus, new benzimidazole-thiazole hybrids (3-10) were designed and synthesized as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory agents. The in vitro evaluation displayed that the derivatives 4b, 4d, 5b, 6a, 7a, and 8b demonstrated dual inhibitory efficiency against both AChE with IC50 ranging from 4.55 to 8.62\u2009\u00b5M and BChE with IC50 ranging from 3.50 to 8.32\u2009\u00b5M. By analyzing the Lineweaver-Burk plot, an uncompetitive form of inhibition was determined for the highly active compound 4d, revealing its inhibition type. The human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cell line\u00a0was used to ensure the safety of the most potent cholinesterase inhibitors. Furthermore, compounds 4b, 4d, 5b, 6a, 7a, and 8b were evaluated for their neuroprotective and antioxidant properties, as well as their ability to suppress COX-2. The results demonstrated that compounds 4d, 5b, and 8b presented significant neuroprotection efficiency against H2 O2 -induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells with % cell viability of 67.42\u2009\u00b1\u20097.90%, 62.51\u2009\u00b1\u20096.71%, and 72.61\u2009\u00b1\u20098.10%, respectively, while the tested candidates did not reveal significant antioxidant activity. Otherwise, compounds 4b, 6a, 7a, and 8b displayed outstanding COX-2 inhibition effects with IC50 ranging from 0.050 to 0.080\u2009\u03bcM relative to celecoxib (IC50 \u2009=\u20090.050\u2009\u00b5M). In addition, molecular docking was carried out for the potent benzimidazole-thiazole hybrids with the active sites of both AChE (PDB ID: 4EY7) and BChE (PDB code: 1P0P). The tested candidates fit well in the active sites of both portions, with docking scores ranging from -8.65 to -6.64\u2009kcal/mol (for AChE) and -8.71 to -7.73\u2009kcal/mol (for BChE). In silico results show that the synthesized benzimidazole-thiazole hybrids have good physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties with no Lipinski rule violations. The preceding results exhibited that compound 4d could be used as a new template for developing more significant cholinesterase inhibitors in the future.",

Our systematic search yielded 6 RCT reports (21,065 treated and 20,997 placebo participants) and 45 observational reports (768,866 patient cases and 5.5 million controls). We used fixed and random effect meta-analysis to derive pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) from these studies.

        "AbstractText": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is located at the interface between the vascular system and the brain parenchyma, and is responsible for communication with systemic circulation and peripheral tissues. During life, the BBB can be subjected to a wide range of perturbations or stresses that may be endogenous or exogenous, pathological or therapeutic, or intended or unintended. The risk factors for many diseases of the brain are multifactorial and involve perturbations that may occur simultaneously (e.g., two-hit model for Alzheimer's disease) and result in different outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand the influence of individual perturbations on BBB function in isolation. Here we review the effects of eight perturbations: mechanical forces, temperature, electromagnetic radiation, hypoxia, endogenous factors, exogenous factors, chemical factors, and pathogens. While some perturbations may result in acute or chronic BBB disruption, many are also exploited for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The resultant outcome on BBB function depends on the dose (or magnitude) and duration of the perturbation. Homeostasis may be restored by self-repair, for example, via processes such as proliferation of affected cells or angiogenesis to create new vasculature. Transient or sustained BBB dysfunction may result in acute or pathological symptoms, for example, microhemorrhages or hypoperfusion. In more extreme cases, perturbations may lead to cytotoxicity and cell death, for example, through exposure to cytotoxic plaques.",

The risk of being diagnosed with AD increases the risk for epilepsy, and in parallel, a history of epilepsy increases the likelihood of the development of AD. This bi-directional relationship may be due to underlying shared pathophysiologic hallmarks, including decreased cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b242), increased hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and hippocampal hyperexcitability. Additionally, there are practical treatment considerations in patients with co-morbid AD and epilepsy-namely, there is a higher risk of seizures associated with medications commonly prescribed for Alzheimer's disease patients, including antidepressants and antipsychotics such as trazodone, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and first-generation neuroleptics. Anti-amyloid antibodies like aducanumab and lecanemab present new and unique considerations in patients with co-morbid AD and epilepsy given the risk of seizures associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) seen with this drug class. Finally, we identify and detail five active studies, including two clinical trials of levetiracetam in the respective treatment of cognition and neuropsychiatric features of AD, a study characterizing the prevalence of epilepsy in AD via prolonged EEG monitoring, a study characterizing AD biomarkers in late-onset epilepsy, and a study evaluating hyperexcitability in AD.

        "AbstractText": "DNA is a remarkably precise medium for copying and storing biological information. It serves as a design for cellular machinery that permits cells, organs, and even whole organisms to work. The fidelity of DNA replication results from the action of hundreds of genes involved in proofreading and damage repair. All human cells can acquire genetic changes in their DNA all over life. Genetic mutations are changes to the DNA sequence that happen during cell division when the cells make copies of themselves. Mutations in the DNA can cause genetic illnesses such as cancer, or they could help humans better adapt to their environment over time. The endogenous reactive metabolites, therapeutic medicines, and an excess of environmental mutagens, such as UV rays all continuously damage DNA, compromising its integrity. One or more chromosomal alterations and point mutations at a single site (monogenic mutation) including deletions, duplications, and inversions illustrate such DNA mutations. Genetic conditions can occur when an altered gene is inherited from parents, which increases the risk of developing that particular condition, or some gene alterations can happen randomly. Moreover, symptoms of genetic conditions depend on which gene has a mutation. There are many different diseases and conditions caused by mutations. Some of the most common genetic conditions are Alzheimer's disease, some cancers, cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, and sickle cell disease. Interestingly, scientists find that DNA mutations are more common than formerly thought. This review outlines the main DNA mutations that occur along the human genome and their influence on human health.",

        "AbstractText": "The pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD) typically takes decades from onset to clinical symptoms. Early brain changes in AD include MRI-measurable features such as altered functional connectivity (FC) and white matter degeneration. The ability of these features to discriminate between subjects without a diagnosis, or their prognostic value, is however not established. The main trigger mechanism of AD is still debated, although impaired brain glucose metabolism is taking an increasingly central role. Here, we used a rat model of sporadic AD, based on impaired brain glucose metabolism induced by an intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). We characterized alterations in FC and white matter microstructure longitudinally using functional and diffusion MRI. Those MRI-derived measures were used to classify STZ from control rats using machine learning, and the importance of each individual measure was quantified using explainable artificial intelligence methods. Overall, combining all the FC and white matter metrics in an ensemble way was the best strategy to discriminate STZ rats, with a consistent accuracy over 0.85. However, the best accuracy early on was achieved using white matter microstructure features, and later on using FC. This suggests that consistent damage in white matter in the STZ group might precede FC. For cross-timepoint prediction, microstructure features also had the highest performance while, in contrast, that of FC was reduced by its dynamic pattern which shifted from early hyperconnectivity to late hypoconnectivity. Our study highlights the MRI-derived measures that best discriminate STZ vs control rats early in the course of the disease, with potential translation to humans.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between serum immunoglobulins and biomarkers of dementia. Between 1997 and 2009, serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM) were measured in dementia-free participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study. A random subset of participants had assessment of biomarkers in plasma (total tau (t-tau), neurofilament light chain (NfL), amyloid-\u03b240 (A\u03b2-40), amyloid-\u03b242 (A\u03b2-42), while another subset of participants underwent neuroimaging to quantify brain volume, white matter structural integrity and markers of cerebral small vessel disease. Linear regression models were constructed to determine cross-sectional associations between IgA, IgG, IgM and biomarkers of dementia, with adjustment for potential confounders. Multiple testing correction was applied using the false discovery rate. As a sensitivity analysis, we re-ran the models for participants within the reference range of immunoglobulins, excluding those using immunomodulating drugs, and conducted a stratified analysis by APOE-\u03b54 carriership and sex. Of 8,768 participants with serum immunoglobulins, 3,455 participants (65.8\u00a0years [interquartile range (IQR): 61.5-72.0], 57.2% female) had plasma biomarkers available and 3,139 participants (57.4\u00a0years [IQR: 52.7-60.7], 54.4% female) had neuroimaging data. Overall, no associations between serum immunoglobulins and biomarkers of dementia remained significant after correction for multiple testing. However, several suggestive associations were noted: higher serum IgA levels concurred with lower plasma levels of A\u03b2-42 (standardized adjusted mean difference: -0.015 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.029--0.002], p\u2009=\u20092.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910-2), and a lower total brain volume, mainly driven by less gray matter (-0.027 [-0.046--0.008],\u00a0p\u2009=\u20096.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3) and more white matter hyperintensities (0.047 [0.016 - 0.077], p\u2009=\u20093.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3). In sensitivity analyses, higher IgM was\u00a0linked to lower t-tau, A\u03b2-40, and A\u03b2-42, but also a loss of white matter microstructural integrity. Stratified analyses indicate that these associations potentially differ between carriers and non-carriers of the APOE-\u03b54 allele and men and women. While associations between serum immunoglobulins and early markers of dementia could not be established in this population-based sample, it may be valuable to consider factors such as APOE-\u03b54 allele carriership and sex in future investigations.",

The current study was designed to know the biological characterization of the plant genome and biosynthesis of plant metabolites essential for its medicinal applications. Tinospora cordifolia's complete genome was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing technology. The draft genome was assembled through a de novo method. An integrative genome annotation approach was used to perform functional gene prediction. The pathway analysis was carried out using the KEGG database. The total genome size obtained after genome assembly was 894 Mb with an N50 of 9148 bp. The integrative annotation approach resulted in 35,111 protein-coding genes. In addition, genes responsible for the synthesis of syringin, a secondary metabolite found in plants, were identified. In comparison to the standard drug (dopamine, rasagiline, and selegiline), syringin's molecular docking exhibited a greater binding affinity from the range of - 4.3 to - 6.6 kcal/mol for all the targets of Parkinson's disease and for Alzheimer's targets; it has shown the maximum potency from the range of - 6.5 to - 7.4 kcal/mol with respect to the standard drug (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine).

We found a marked increase in ubiquitinylated proteins in post-mortem AD hippocampi compared to controls. Using several experimental models, we show that amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os) inhibit synaptic proteasome activity and trigger a reduction in synaptic proteasome content. We further show proteasome inhibition specifically in hippocampal synaptic fractions derived from APPswePS1\u0394E9 mice. Reduced synaptic proteasome activity instigated by A\u03b2Os is corrected by treatment with rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, in mice. Results further show that dynein inhibition blocks A\u03b2O-induced reduction in dendritic proteasome content in hippocampal neurons. Finally, proteasome inhibition induces AD-like pathological features, including reactive oxygen species and dendritic spine loss in hippocampal neurons, inhibition of hippocampal mRNA translation, and memory impairment in mice.

We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) of enhanced social interactions, hypothesizing that conversational interactions can stimulate brain functions among socially isolated older adults without dementia. We report topline results of this multi-site RCT (Internet-based conversational engagement clinical trial [I-CONECT]; NCT02871921). The experimental group received cognitively stimulating semi-structured conversations with trained interviewers via internet/webcam four times per week for six months (induction) and twice per week for an additional six months (maintenance). The experimental and control groups both received weekly 10-minute telephone check-ins. Protocol modifications were required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 186 participants were randomized. After the induction period, the experimental group had higher global cognitive test scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [primary outcome]; 1.75 points [p=0.03]. After induction, experimental group subjects with normal cognition had higher language-based executive function (semantic fluency test [secondary outcome]; 2.56 points [p=0.03]. At the end of the maintenance period, experimental group MCI subjects had higher encoding function (Craft Story immediate recall test [secondary outcome]; 2.19 points [p=0.04]. Measure of emotional well-being improved in both control and experimental groups. Resting-state functional MRI showed that the experimental group had increased connectivity within the dorsal attention network relative to the control group (p = 0.02), but the sample size was limited. Providing frequent stimulating conversational interactions via the internet could be an effective home-based dementia risk reduction strategy against social isolation and cognitive decline.",

        "AbstractText": "Recent years have seen both considerable progress and controversy in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. After decades of slow to negligible movement towards the development of disease modifying therapies, promising outcomes in recent clinical trials with several monoclonal antibodies targeting various forms of the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide have at last opened a possible way forward. In fact, at this point multiple anti-A\u03b2 therapeutics are close to receiving (or have already received) regulatory approval. Although these outcomes are not without some degree of divisiveness, the fact remains that targeting amyloid for removal has finally shown at least modest efficacy in slowing the otherwise relentless progression of the disease. Although the validation of the long standing amyloid cascade hypothesis would seem to be at hand, what remains is the puzzling issue of why - if A\u03b2 indeed causes AD - does removing it from the brain not stop the disease entirely.",

        "AbstractText": "The apolipoprotein (APOE) \u025b4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the \u025b2 allele is thought to be protective against AD. Few studies have examined the relationship between brain pathologies, atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and APOE status in those with the \u025b2\u025b4 genotype and results are inconsistent for those with an \u025b2 allele. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging participants were divided into one of four APOE allele profiles (E4= \u025b4\u025b4 or \u025b3 \u025b4; E2= \u025b2\u025b2 or \u025b2\u025b3; E3= \u025b3\u025b3; or E24= \u025b2\u025b4). Linear mixed models examined the relationship between APOE profiles and brain changes (i.e., regional WMHs, ventricle size, hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume, amyloid level, and phosphorylated tau measures), while controlling for age, sex, education, and diagnostic status at baseline and over time. APOE \u025b4 is associated with increased pathology while \u025b2 positivity is associated with reduced baseline and lower accumulation of pathologies and neurodegeneration. APOE \u025b2\u025b4 is similar to \u025b4 (increased neurodegeneration) but with a slower rate of change. The strong associations observed between APOE and pathology show the importance of how genetic factors influence structural brain changes. These findings suggest that \u025b2\u025b4 genotype is related to increased declines associated with the \u025b4 as opposed to the protective effects of the \u025b2. These findings have important implications for initiating treatments and interventions. Given that people with the \u025b2\u025b4 genotype can expect to have increased atrophy, they should be considered (alongside those with an \u025b4) in targeted interventions to reduce brain changes that occur with AD.",

        "AbstractText": "The risk of brain exposure to ionizing radiation increases gradually due to the extensive application of nuclear technology in medical, industrial, and aerospace fields. Radiation-induced brain injury (RBI) is highly likely to cause a wide range of neurological complications, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression. Ginkgolide B (GB) is one of the effective active components extracted from ginkgo biloba leaves, exerts protective effects on CNS, which involved in the regulation of Hippo signaling pathway. MST1, as one of the core kinases of the Hippo pathway, participated in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, it remains unclear whether GB attenuates radiation brain injury (RBI) and whether the radioprotective effect of GB refers to MST1 signaling. Hence, our study aimed to explore the radiation protection effect and the potential mechanism of GB. C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with X-ray (20\u2009Gy) to establish an RBI model. Then, morris water maze test (MWM) and step-down passive avoidance test (SDPAT) were used to assess the learning and memory function of mice. The open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were used to assess changes in locomotors activity and hopelessness. Besides, X-ray-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells were used to verify the radioprotective effect of GB. Immunofluorescence double staining, Dihydroethidium (DHE), western blot, and flow cytometry were used to explore the role of DCC/MST1 signaling in RBI. In this study, X-ray-treated mice exhibited cognitive impairment and depression-like behavior, which was ameliorated by GB treatment. GB also reduced the ROS production and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus. Moreover, GB increased the protein levels of p-AKT and Bcl2, while decreased the protein levels of MST1, p-p38, p-JNK, cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, exogenous Netrin-1 alleviated X-ray-induced ROS production and apoptosis, whereas knockout of Netrin-1 receptor DCC abolished the protective effect of GB. Oxidative stress and MST1-mediated neuronal apoptosis participated in radiation-induced cognitive impairment and depression-like behaviors, and modulation of DCC by GB was an effective intervention against RBI.",

Herein, the combination of eliminating the A\u03b2 oligomers and alleviating the inflammation is a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the intrinsic deficiencies of the drugs severely restrict their therapeutic effects. Inspired by the properties of rabies virus, a BIOMIMIC nanobullet (PBACR@NRs/SA) targeting neurons has been developed. The BIOMIMIC nanobullets possess the BBB penetrating character based on Iron Oxide nanorods, it can sequentially release rosmarinic acid and siRNA targeting NF-\u03baB triggered by Microenvironment, which improve the Microenvironment Inflammation and realize the Cure for Alzheimer's disease. Compared with non-biomimic systems, the biomimic nanobullets exhibit a less caveolin-dependent internalization pathway, which reduce ROS production and mitochondrial fission in neurons. Therefore, the BIOMIMIC nanobullet is hopeful for the treatment of Alzheimer's diseases and provides a promising platform for other brain diseases' treatments. This article is protected by copyright.

Such a capability, however, is of great importance since it can improve patient management by providing information on the speed of disease progression already at the admission stage, or it can enrich the clinical trials with fast progressors and avoid the need for control arms by the means of digital twins. In this work, we develop a deep learning method that models the evolution of age-related disease by processing a single medical scan and providing a segmentation of the target anatomy at a requested future point in time. Our method represents a time-invariant physical process and solves a large-scale problem of modeling temporal pixel-level changes utilizing NeuralODEs. In addition, we demonstrate the approaches to incorporate the prior domain-specific constraints into our method and define temporal Dice loss for learning temporal objectives. To evaluate the applicability of our approach across different age-related diseases and imaging modalities, we developed and tested the proposed method on the datasets with 967 retinal OCT volumes of 100 patients with Geographic Atrophy and 2823 brain MRI volumes of 633 patients with Alzheimer's Disease. For Geographic Atrophy, the proposed method outperformed the related baseline models in the atrophy growth prediction. For Alzheimer's Disease, the proposed method demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting the brain ventricle changes induced by the disease, achieving the state-of-the-art result on TADPOLE cross-sectional prediction challenge dataset.",

Thus, modulation of the gut microbiota has become a novel paradigm for clinical management of AD, and emerging effort has focused on developing potential novel strategies for preventing and/or treating the disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the connection and causal relationship between gut dysbiosis and AD, the mechanisms of gut microbiota in driving AD progression, and the successes and challenges of implementing available gut microbiome-targeted therapies (including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation) in preventive and/or therapeutic preclinical and clinical intervention studies of AD.

        "AbstractText": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an important hydrolase in cholinergic synapses and a candidate target in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The lithium treatment widely used in neurological disorders can alter the AChE activity, yet the underlying mechanism of how the ion species regulate the enzymatic activity remains unclear. In this work, we performed combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and well-tempered metadynamics to understand the modulation of human AChE (hAChE) activity using three alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, and K+) in different concentrations. Our simulations show that the binding affinity and catalytic activity are affected by different ion species through allosteric ion coordination geometries on the hAChE complex and distant electrostatic screening effect. A Li+ cluster involving D330, E393, and D397 residues and three Li+ ions was found to be highly conserved and can be critical to the enzyme activity. Binding energy calculations indicate that the electrostatic screening from allosterically bound cations can affect the key residues at the catalytic site and active-site gorge, including E199. Furthermore, an increase in ion concentration can lead to lower reactivity, especially for Li+ ions, which exhibit more cation-hAChE contacts than Na+ and K+. The selective ion binding and their preferred modulation on hAChE are highly related to ion species. This work provides a molecular perspective on selective modulation by different ion species of the enzyme catalytic processes.",

However, these models potentially have biases and may perpetuate or exacerbate existing disparities. To characterize the algorithmic fairness of longitudinal prediction models for AD progression. This prognostic study investigated the algorithmic fairness of logistic regression, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks for predicting progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD using data from participants in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative evaluated at 57 sites in the US and Canada. Participants aged 54 to 91 years who contributed data on at least 2 visits between September 2005 and May 2017 were included. Data were analyzed in October 2022. Fairness was quantified across sex, ethnicity, and race groups. Neuropsychological test scores, anatomical features from T1 magnetic resonance imaging, measures extracted from positron emission tomography, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were included as predictors. Outcome measures quantified fairness of prediction models (logistic regression [LR], support vector machine [SVM], and recurrent neural network [RNN] models), including equal opportunity, equalized odds, and demographic parity. Specifically, if the model exhibited equal sensitivity for all groups, it aligned with the principle of equal opportunity, indicating fairness in predictive performance. A total of 1730 participants in the cohort (mean [SD] age, 73.81 [6.92] years; 776 females [44.9%]; 69 Hispanic [4.0%] and 1661 non-Hispanic [96.0%]; 29 Asian [1.7%], 77 Black [4.5%], 1599 White [92.4%], and 25 other race [1.4%]) were included. Sensitivity for predicting progression to MCI and AD was lower for Hispanic participants compared with non-Hispanic participants; the difference (SD) in true positive rate ranged from 20.9% (5.5%) for the RNN model to 27.8% (9.8%) for the SVM model in MCI and 24.1% (5.4%) for the RNN model to 48.2% (17.3%) for the LR model in AD. Sensitivity was similarly lower for Black and Asian participants compared with non-Hispanic White participants; for example, the difference (SD) in AD true positive rate was 14.5% (51.6%) in the LR model, 12.3% (35.1%) in the SVM model, and 28.4% (16.8%) in the RNN model for Black vs White participants, and the difference (SD) in MCI true positive rate was 25.6% (13.1%) in the LR model, 24.3% (13.1%) in the SVM model, and 6.8% (18.7%) in the RNN model for Asian vs White participants. Models generally satisfied metrics of fairness with respect to sex, with no significant differences by group, except for cognitively normal (CN)-MCI and MCI-AD transitions (eg, an absolute increase [SD] in the true positive rate of CN-MCI transitions of 10.3% [27.8%] for the LR model). In this study, models were accurate in aggregate but failed to satisfy fairness metrics. These findings suggest that fairness should be considered in the development and use of machine learning models for AD progression.",

Multiple alterations in cellular mechanisms have been associated with AD, but there is no clear information on AD pathogenesis during brain aging. This study aimed to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the frontal lobe of aging brains and to identify shared crucial mechanisms in the aging brain linked to AD pathogenesis. Three datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Biological function analysis was performed by DAVID and KEGG databases. An AD patient's cohort (GSE150696) was collected for verification of the enriched pathway. The results demonstrated that multiple neurochemical synapsis and regulation of the cytoskeleton are linked to AD pathogenesis during aging. Taken together, this study contributes to our further understanding of neural alterations during aging in AD that could be used to develop therapeutics for early intervention to prevent or slow progression.",

This meta-analysis aims to investigate the possible mechanisms by which Sal exerts its anti-AD effects by evaluating behavioral indicators and biochemical characteristics. A total of 20 studies were included, and the results showed that the Sal treatment significantly improved behavior abnormalities in AD animal models. With regard to neurobiochemical indicators, Sal treatment could effectively increase the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase, decrease the oxidative stress indicator malondialdehyde, and decrease the inflammatory indicators interleukin 1\u03b2, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. Sal treatment was effective in reducing neuropathological indicators, such as amyloid-\u03b2 levels and the number of apoptotic cells.

O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by 2 enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Development of a PET tracer would therefore be an essential tool for developing therapeutic small-molecule inhibitors of OGA, enabling clinical testing of target engagement and dose selection. Methods: A collection of small-molecule compounds was screened for inhibitory activity and high-affinity binding to OGA, as well as favorable PET tracer attributes (multidrug resistance protein 1 efflux, central nervous system PET multiparameter optimization, etc.). Two lead compounds with high affinity and selectivity for OGA were selected for further profiling, including OGA binding to tissue homogenate using a radioligand competition binding assay. In vivo pharmacokinetics were established using a microdosing approach with unlabeled compounds in rats. In vivo imaging studies were performed in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with 11C-labeled compounds. Results: Two selected candidates, BIO-735 and BIO-578, displayed promising attributes in\u00a0vitro. After radiolabeling with tritium, [3H]BIO-735 and [3H]BIO-578 binding in rodent brain homogenates demonstrated dissociation constants of 0.6 and 2.3\u2009nM, respectively. Binding was inhibited, concentration-dependently, by homologous compounds and thiamet G, a well-characterized and structurally diverse OGA inhibitor. Imaging studies in rats and NHPs showed both tracers had high uptake in the brain and inhibition of binding to OGA in the presence of a nonradioactive compound. However, only BIO-578 demonstrated reversible binding kinetics within the time frame of a PET study with a 11C-labeled molecule to enable quantification using kinetic modeling. Specificity of tracer uptake was confirmed with a 10\u2009mg/kg blocking dose of thiamet G. Conclusion: We describe the development and testing of 2 11C PET tracers targeting the protein OGA. The lead compound BIO-578 demonstrated high affinity and selectivity for OGA in rodent and human postmortem brain tissue, leading to its further testing in NHPs. NHP PET imaging studies showed that the tracer had excellent brain kinetics, with full inhibition of specific binding by thiamet G.

Finally, no significant correlations were found between regional toxicity or between postoperative muscle or sensitivity decrease and biomarker release. During ILP, NfL and tau levels increased significantly. No obvious correlations were observed between biomarker release and regional toxicity or decreased muscle strength or sensitivity, although large-scale studies are warranted.",

We explored the association between SDOH factors and incident postoperative delirium. A retrospective study of a prospective cohort of patients enrolled from June 18, 2010, to August 8, 2013, across two academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Overall, 560 older adults age \u226570\u2009years undergoing major elective non-cardiac surgery were included in this analysis. Exposure variables included income, lack of private insurance, and neighborhood disadvantage. Our main outcome was incident postoperative delirium, measured using the Confusion Assessment Method long form. Older age (odds ratio, OR: 1.01, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.00, 1.02), income <20,000 a year (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.26), lack of private insurance (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38), higher depressive symptomatology (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04), and the Area Deprivation Index (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) were significantly associated with increased risk of postoperative delirium in bivariable analyses. In a multivariable model, explaining 27% of the variance in postoperative delirium, significant independent variables were older age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00, 1.02), lack of private insurance (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02, 1.36), and depressive symptoms (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00, 1.03). Household income was no longer a significant independent predictor of delirium in the multivariable model (OR:1.02, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.15). The type of medical insurance significantly mediated the association between household income and incident delirium. Lack of private insurance, a social determinant of health reflecting socioeconomic status, emerged as a novel and important independent risk factor for delirium. Future efforts should consider targeting SDOH factors to prevent postoperative delirium in older adults.",

Cultured microglial BV2 cells were treated with different concentrations of A\u03b21-42, lead acetate or their combination for 12 h, and the changes in cell viability and morphology were evaluated. Immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect iNOS and oxidative stress level in the treated cells, and the release of inflammatory factors was detected using ELISA. Western blotting and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to detect the expressions of CTR1 and ATP7A proteins and copper content in the cells. Treatment with 15 and 20 \u03bcmol/L A\u03b21-42 for 12 h significantly lowered the viability of BV2 cells. Treatment with A\u03b21-42 at 10 \u03bcmol/L for 12 h obviously increased the release of iNOS, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the cells (P<0.05), and its combination with 15 or 20 \u03bcmol/L lead acetate more strongly lowered BV2 cell viability (P<0.05). Compared with 10 \u03bcmol/L A\u03b21-42 treatment alone, 10 \u03bcmol/L A\u03b21-42 combined with 10 \u03bcmol/L lead acetate for 12 h caused more obvious microglial activation, as manifested by enlarged cell bodies, increased cell protrusions and elongation, enhanced release of iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and ROS, and increased intracellular copper ion accumulation and expression of copper transporter CTR1 (P<0.05). Compared with the conditioned medium from activated BV2 cells, which caused obvious injuries in hippocampal neuron HT22 cells (P<0.001), the medium from BV2 cells treated with NAC and the copper ion chelating agent TM caused milder injuries in HT22 cells (P<0.05).

        "ArticleTitle": "Getting LOST: A conceptual framework for supporting and enhancing spatial navigation in aging.",
        "AbstractText": "Spatial navigation is more difficult and effortful for older than younger individuals, a shift which occurs for a variety of neurological, physical, and cognitive reasons associated with aging. Despite a large body of evidence documenting age-related deficits in spatial navigation, comparatively less research addresses how to facilitate more effective navigation behavior for older adults. Since navigation challenges arise for a variety of reasons in old age, a one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely to work. Here, we introduce a framework for the variety of spatial navigation challenges faced in aging, which we call LOST-Location, Orientation, Spatial mapping, and Transit. The LOST framework builds on evidence from the cognitive neuroscience of spatial navigation, which reveals distinct components underpinning human wayfinding. We evaluate research on navigational aids-devices and depictions-which help people find their way around; and we reflect on how navigation aids solve (or fail to solve) specific wayfinding difficulties faced by older adults. In summary, we emphasize a bespoke approach to improving spatial navigation in aging, which focuses on tailoring navigation solutions to specific navigation challenges. Our hope is that by providing precise support to older navigators, navigation opportunities can facilitate independence and exploration, while minimizing the danger of becoming lost. We conclude by delineating critical knowledge gaps in how to improve older adults' spatial navigation capacities that the novel LOST framework could guide to address.

We explored the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of vascular injury and neuroinflammation with AD biomarkers in middle-aged Black/African American (B/AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants. Adults (45-65 years) with a parental history of AD were enrolled (n\u00a0=\u00a082). CSF and blood biomarkers were collected at baseline and year 2. CSF total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and amyloid beta (A\u03b2)40 were elevated at year 2 compared to baseline. CSF soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (sPDGFR\u03b2) levels, a marker of pericyte injury, correlated positively with t-tau, p-tau, A\u03b240 markers of vascular injury, and cytokines at baseline and year 2.

We downloaded AD and CKD datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and analyzed differentially expressed genes and weighted gene co-expression networks to identify candidate genes for AD and CKD. We used a combination of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest algorithms to select the shared genes. Subsequently, we shared genes and performed an immune infiltration analysis to investigate the association between different immune cell types and shared genes. Finally, we elucidated the relationship between the expression levels of the shared genes in disease samples and cells using single-cell analysis. Our analysis identified 150 candidate genes that may be primarily involved in immune inflammatory responses and energy metabolism pathways. We found that JunD Proto-Oncogene, ALF transcription elongation factor 1, and ZFP36 Ring Finger Protein Like 1 were the best co-diagnostic markers for AD and CKD based on the results of Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator analysis and the random forest algorithm. Based on the results of immune infiltration analysis, macrophages and T-cells play a significant role in the progression of AD and CKD. Our scRNA-sequencing data showed that the 3 shared genes in AD were significantly expressed in astrocytes, excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and MAIT cells.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects various brain cell types, including astrocytes, which are the most abundant cell types in the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes not only provide homeostatic support to neurons but also actively regulate synaptic signaling and functions and become reactive in response to CNS insults through diverse signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT, NF-\u03baB, and GPCR-elicited pathways. The advent of new technology for transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level has led to increasing recognition of the highly versatile nature of reactive astrocytes and the context-dependent specificity of astrocyte reactivity. In AD, reactive astrocytes have long been observed in senile plaques and have recently been suggested to play a role in AD pathogenesis and progression. However, the precise contributions of reactive astrocytes to AD remain elusive, and targeting this complex cell population for AD treatment poses significant challenges. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of astrocyte reactivity and its role in AD, with a particular focus on the signaling pathways that promote astrocyte reactivity and the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes. Furthermore, we explore potential implications for the development of therapeutics for AD. Our objective is to shed light on the complex involvement of astrocytes in AD and offer insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for treating and managing this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.",

In 745 participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (\u226550 years of age) with serial WM assessments from diffusion MRI and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-MRI, we examined associations between baseline non-imaging indicators (demographics, vascular risk factors [VRFs], gait, behavioral, plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], and plasma neurofilament light chain [NfL]) and WM damage across three age tertiles. VRFs and gait were associated with diffusion changes even in low age strata. All measures (VRFs, gait, behavioral, plasma GFAP, plasma NfL) were associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) but mainly in intermediate and high age strata. Non-imaging indicators of VCID were related to WM damage and may aid in screening participants and assessing outcomes for VCID. Non-imaging indicators of VCID can aid in prediction of MRI-measured WM damage but their importance differed by age. Vascular risk and gait measures were associated with early VCID changes measured using diffusion MRI. Plasma markers explained variability in WMH across age strata.

No study so far has reported the association between the IR evaluated through triglyceride glucose (TyG) index and cognitive function among nondiabetics. This study aims to assess this association among US nondiabetic older elderly. Data were obtained from the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Low cognitive function was evaluated using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Battery for immediate word list learning (CERAD-WL) and delayed recall (CERAD-DR) test, the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to compute the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidential interval (CI) to examine the association between the TyG index (continuous and quartiles) and low cognitive function. A total of 661 nondiabetic older adults were included with a mean age of 68.62 \u00b1 6.49 years. Compared to the 1st quartile of the TyG index, participants in the TyG index 4th quartile were associated with low cognitive function evaluated through the CERAD test (CERAD-WL and CERAD-DR) [OR: 2.62; 95% CI (1.31, 5.23); P\u2009<\u20090.05].

However, conversations around cognitive changes can be challenging for patients, family members, and clinicians to initiate, with all groups reporting barriers to open dialogue. With the expanding array of evidence-based interventions for ADRD, from multidomain care management to novel biotherapeutics for early-stage AD, incorporating conversations about brain health into routine healthcare should become a standard of care. We conducted a systematic review to identify barriers to and facilitators of brain health conversations in primary care settings. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for qualitative or quantitative studies conducted in the US between January 2000 and October 2022 that evaluated perceptions of cognition and provider-patient brain health conversations prior to formal screening for, or diagnosis of, mild cognitive impairment or ADRD. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. In total, 5547 unique abstracts were screened and 22 articles describing 19 studies were included. The studies explored perceptions of cognition among laypersons or clinicians, or provider-patient interactions in the context of a patient's cognitive concerns. We identified 4 main themes: (1) PCCs are hesitant to discuss brain health and cognitive concerns; (2) patients are hesitant to raise cognitive concerns; (3) evidence to guide clinicians in developing treatment plans that address cognitive decline is often poorly communicated; and (4) social and cultural context influence perceptions of brain health and cognition, and therefore affect clinical engagement. Early conversations about brain health between PCCs and their patients are rare, and effective tools, processes, and strategies are needed to make these vital conversations routine.",

Recently, geometric deep learning, especially Graph Neural Networks, has shown promising performance in molecular science applications. However, most existing works often impose targeted inductive biases to a specific molecular system, and are inefficient when applied to macromolecules or large-scale tasks, thereby limiting their applications to many real-world problems. To address these challenges, we present PAMNet, a universal framework for accurately and efficiently learning the representations of three-dimensional (3D) molecules of varying sizes and types in any molecular system. Inspired by molecular mechanics, PAMNet induces a physics-informed bias to explicitly model local and non-local interactions and their combined effects. As a result, PAMNet can reduce expensive operations, making it time and memory efficient. In extensive benchmark studies, PAMNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines regarding both accuracy and efficiency in three diverse learning tasks: small molecule properties, RNA 3D structures, and protein-ligand binding affinities.

In the presymptomatic stage, Tg2576 mice displayed an increased gastrointestinal electrophilic tone, characterized by higher lipid peroxidation and elevated Mn/Fe-SOD activity. In the symptomatic stage, these alterations are rectified, but the total antioxidant capacity is decreased. Chronic oral d-galactose increased the antioxidant capacity and reduced lipid peroxidation in the Tg2576 but had the opposite effects in the wild-type animals. The total antioxidant capacity of the gastrointestinal tract was associated with greater spatial memory. Gut redox homeostasis might be involved in the development and progression of AD pathophysiology and should be further explored in this context.",

        "AbstractText": "Although mainly located in genic regions and being mutation hotspots, intact blocks of CG-rich trinucleotide short tandem repeats (STRs) are largely overlooked with respect to their link with natural selection. The human RAB26 (member RAS oncogene family) directs synaptic and secretory vesicles into preautophagosomal structures, inhibition of which specifically disrupts axonal transport of degradative organelles and leads to an axonal dystrophy, resembling Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human RAB26 contains a GCC repeat in the top 1st percent in respect of length. Here we sequenced this STR in 441 Iranian individuals, consisting of late-onset neurocognitive disorder (NCD) (N=216) and controls (N=225). In both groups, the 12-repeat allele and the 12/12 genotype were predominantly abundant. We found excess of homozygosity for non-12 alleles in the NCD group (Mid-P exact=0.027). Furthermore, divergent genotypes were detected that were specific to the NCD group (2.8% of genotypes) (Mid-P exact=0.006) or controls (3.1% of genotypes) (Mid-P exact=0.004). The patients harboring divergent genotypes received the diagnosis of AD. Based on the predominant abundance of the 12-repeat and 12/12 genotype in both groups, excess of non-12 homozygosity in the NCD group, and divergent genotypes across the NCD and control groups, we propose natural selection at this locus and link with late-onset AD. Our findings strengthen the hypothesis that a collection of rare genotypes unambiguously contribute to the pathogenesis of late-onset NCDs, such as AD.",

However, physiological A\u03b2 level is essential to improves neuronal survival, attenuates neuronal apoptosis and has neuroprotective effect. In addition, physiological APP level has neurotrophic effect on the central nervous system (CNS). APP has a critical role in the brain growth and development via activation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and acceleration of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, APP is cleaved by \u03b1 secretase to form a neuroprotective soluble APP alpha (sAPP\u03b1) in non-amyloidogenic pathway.

        "AbstractText": "Patients with chronic pain often have cognitive impairment; this is especially true in elderly patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. This was addressed in the present study by investigating the effect of chronic neuropathic pain on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive impairment using amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice subjected to spared-nerve injury (SNI). The Von Frey test was performed to determine the mechanical threshold of mouse hind limbs after SNI. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory. Doublecortin-positive (DCX+), 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)+, BrdU+/neuronal nuclei (NeuN)+, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)+ neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. CCL2 and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) protein levels in the mouse hippocampus were analyzed by western blotting. The results showed that APP/PS1 mice with chronic neuropathic pain induced by SNI had significant learning and memory impairment. This was accompanied by increased CCL2 and CCR2 expression and decreases in the number of DCX+, BrdU+, and BrdU+/NeuN+ neurons. These results suggest that chronic neuropathic pain is associated with cognitive impairment, which may be caused by CCL2/CCR2 signaling-mediated inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, therapeutic strategies that alleviate neuropathic pain can potentially slow cognitive decline in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Apart from its anti-depressive and anxiolytic effects, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment also offers intracellular modifications that may help to improve neurogenesis, reduce amyloid burden & Tau pathologies, and neuroinflammation in AD. Despite its multifaceted impact in the brain, the exact physiological and molecular mechanism by which SSRIs such as Citalopram improve neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in dementia is poorly understood. In the current study, we investigated the protective role of SSRI, Citalopram, in serotonergic, medullary raphe neurons (RN46A-B14). RN46A-B14 cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant APP and Tau cDNAs for 24\u202fh and then treated with 20\u202f\u03bcM Cit for 24\u202fh. We then assessed mRNA and protein levels of p-Tau, total Tau, serotonin related proteins such as TPH2, SERT, and 5HTR1a, synaptic proteins and cytoskeletal structure. We also assessed cell survival, mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial morphology. The mutant APP and Tau transfected cells showed increased levels of serotonin related proteins and mRNA, while the mRNA and protein levels of synaptic proteins were downregulated. Citalopram treatment significantly reduced pathologically p-Tau level along with the serotonin related protein levels. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the mRNA and protein levels of synaptic genes and cytoskeletal structure in the treated groups. Further, Citalopram also improved cell survival, mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial morphology in Citalopram treated cells that express mAPP and mTau. Taken together these findings suggest Citalopram could not only be a promising therapeutic drug for treating patients with depression, but also for AD patients.",

This study updates the prediction for the National Health Service (NHS) in England, using an improved model and newer data. We reviewed published data on capacity for diagnosis of cognitive impairment combined with expert input and constructed a model for wait times to access from 2023 to 2043. The model tracks patients from initial evaluation in primary care, cognitive testing by a dementia specialist, confirmatory biomarker testing with positron emission tomography (PET) scans or examination of cerebrospinal fluid and infusion delivery. Capacity for specialist visits and PET scans are assumed to be capacity constrained, and cerebrospinal fluid testing and infusion delivery to be scalable. Capacity constraints were projected to result in substantial wait times: patients referred to specialists based on a brief cognitive test, which is the current standard of care, would expect an overall initial wait times of 56\u00a0months in 2023, increasing to 129\u00a0months in 2029 and then falling slowly to around 100\u00a0months. Use of a blood test for the confirmation of Alzheimer's pathology as an additional triage step, would reduce wait times to around 17 to 25\u00a0months. The NHS England lacks capacity to provide timely access to a disease-modifying treatment, which is estimated to result in significant wait times and potentially avoidable disease progression.

Indane derivatives with a donor-\u03c0-acceptor (D-\u03c0-A) structure were designed and synthesized. The probes were evaluated for their ability to bind to \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) protein aggregates, which are a key pathological hallmark of AD. The results showed that several probes exhibited significant changes in fluorescence intensity at wavelengths greater than 600\u00a0nm when they were bound to A\u03b2 aggregates compared to the A\u03b2 monomeric form. Among the tested probes, four D-\u03c0-A type indane derivatives showed promising binding selectivity to A\u03b2 aggregates over non-specific proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). The molecular docking study showed that our compounds were appropriately located along the A\u03b2 fibril axis through the hydrophobic tunnel structure. Further analysis revealed that the most active compound having dimethylaminopyridyl group as an election donor and dicyano group as an electron acceptor could effectively stain A\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue samples from AD transgenic mice. These findings suggest that our indane-based compounds have the potential to serve as fluorescent probes for the detection and monitoring of A\u03b2 aggregation in AD.",

However, little is known about why these sex differences in prevalence rate exist. In the current longitudinal task fMRI study, we explored whether there were sex differences in the patterns of memory decline and brain activity during object-location (spatial context) encoding and retrieval in a large sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Novel or Experimental Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (PREVENT-AD) program who are at heightened risk of developing AD due to having a family history (+FH) of the disease. The goal of the study was to gain insight into whether there are sex differences in the neural correlates of episodic memory decline, which may advance knowledge about sex-specific patterns in the natural progression to AD. Our results indicate that +FH females performed better than +FH males at both baseline and follow-up on neuropsychological and task fMRI measures of episodic memory. Moreover, multivariate data-driven task fMRI analysis identified generalized patterns of longitudinal decline in medial temporal lobe activity that was paralleled by longitudinal increases in lateral prefrontal cortex, caudate and midline cortical activity during successful episodic retrieval and novelty detection in +FH males, but not females. Post-hoc analyses indicated that higher education had a stronger effect on +FH females neuropsychological scores compared to +FH males. We conclude that higher educational attainment may have a greater neuroprotective effect in older +FH females compared to +FH males.",

Using our genome-wide BP database, we delineated the BP-ACC segments of all human introns and found extreme depletion of AG/YAG in the [BP+8, ACC-4] high-risk region. We developed AGAIN as a genome-wide computational approach to systematically and precisely pinpoint intronic AG-gain variants within the BP-ACC regions. AGAIN identified 350 AG-gain variants from the Human Gene Mutation Database, all of which alter splicing and cause disease. Among them, 74% created new acceptor sites, whereas 31% resulted in complete exon skipping. AGAIN also predicts the protein-level products resulting from these two consequences. We performed AGAIN on our exome/genomes database of patients with severe infectious diseases but without known genetic etiology and identified a private homozygous intronic AG-gain variant in the antimycobacterial gene SPPL2A in a patient with mycobacterial disease. AGAIN also predicts a retention of six intronic nucleotides that encode an in-frame stop codon, turning AG-gain into stop-gain. This allele was then confirmed experimentally to lead to loss of function by disrupting splicing. We further showed that AG-gain variants inside the high-risk region led to misspliced products, while those outside the region did not, by two case studies in genes STAT1 and IRF7. We finally evaluated AGAIN on our 14 paired exome-RNAseq samples and found that 82% of AG-gain variants in high-risk regions showed evidence of missplicing.

VH are a major predictor of dementia in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and are included as a core clinical feature in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). A newly developed Noise Pareidolia Test (NPT) was proposed as a possible surrogate marker for VH in DLB patients as increased pareidolic responses correlated with informant-corroborated accounts of VH. This association could, however, be mediated by visuoperceptual impairment. To understand the drivers of performance on the NPT, we contrasted performances in patient groups that varied both in terms of visuoperceptual ability and rates of VH. N = 43 patients were studied of whom n = 13 had DLB or PD with Dementia (PDD); n = 13 had PD; n = 12 had typical, memory-onset Alzheimer's Disease (tAD); and n = 5 had Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) due to Alzheimer's disease. All patient groups reported pareidolias. Within the Lewy body disorders (PD, DLB, PDD), there was no significant difference in pareidolic response rates between hallucinating and non-hallucinating patients. Visuoperceptual deficits and pareidolic responses were most frequent in the PCA group-none of whom reported VH. Regression analyses in the entire patient cohort indicated that pareidolias were strongly predicted by visuoperceptual impairment but not by the presence of VH. These findings suggest that pareidolias reflect the underlying visuoperceptual impairment of Lewy body disorders, rather than being a direct marker for VH.",

Specifically, based on network-structured multi-view data, a structural information mapping model is proposed to capture hierarchical interaction patterns among views. Subsequently, three different types of graph convolutional operations are designed in SM-GAN based on the model. Compared with regular GAN, we add a structural information mapping module between the encoder and decoder wthin the generator, completing the structural information mapping from the micro-view to the macro-view. This paper conducted sufficient validation experiments using public imaging genetics data in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.

G4s folded in proximal promoter regions (PPR) are associated either with positive or negative transcriptional regulation. Given that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) affecting G4 folding (G4-Vars) may alter gene transcription, and that SNVs are associated with the human diseases' onset, we undertook a novel comprehensive study of the G4-Vars genome-wide (G4-variome) to find disease-associated G4-Vars located into PPRs. We developed a bioinformatics strategy to find disease-related SNVs located into PPRs simultaneously overlapping with putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs). We studied five G4-Vars disturbing in vitro the folding and stability of the G4s located into PPRs, which had been formerly associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (GRIN2B), a severe familiar coagulopathy (F7), atopic dermatitis (CSF2), myocardial infarction (SIRT1)\u00a0and deafness (LHFPL5). Results obtained in cultured cells for these five G4-Vars suggest that the changes in the G4s affect the transcription, potentially contributing to the development of the mentioned diseases.

We use a relatively newer network measure of assortativity in metabolic connectivity to understand network differences in patients with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) compared to those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 83 demographically matched patients with dementia (56 AD and 27 MCI) who underwent PET-MRI study, were recruited for this exploratory study. Global and nodal network measures obtained using the BRAPH toolbox were used to derive group-level differences (corrected p<0.05). The methods were validated in age, and gender matched 23 cognitively normal (CN), 25 MCI, and 53 AD patients from the publicly available ADNI data.

Patients with AD revealed significantly increased global assortativity compared to MCI group. In addition, they also revealed increased modularity and decreased participation coefficient. These findings were validated in the ADNI data. We also found that the regional SUV (standard uptake values) measures of the right superior parietal and left superior temporal lobes were proportional to the ACE-III memory subdomain scores. Global errors associated with network assortativity is found in patients with AD making the networks more regular and less resilient.

To assess the stratified associations of APOE genotypes with AD risk across sex, age, race and ethnicity, and global population ancestry. This genetic association study included case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts that recruited referred and volunteer participants. Data were analyzed between March 2022 and April 2023. Genetic data were available from high-density, single-nucleotide variant microarrays, exome microarrays, and whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. Summary statistics were ascertained from published AD genetic studies. The main outcomes were risk for AD (odds ratios [ORs]) and risk of conversion to AD (hazard ratios [HRs]), with 95% CIs. Risk for AD was evaluated through case-control logistic regression analyses. Risk of conversion to AD was evaluated through Cox proportional hazards regression survival analyses. Among 68\u202f756 unique individuals, analyses included 21\u202f852 East Asian (demographic data not available), 5738 Hispanic (68.2% female; mean [SD] age, 75.4 [8.8] years), 7145 non-Hispanic Black (hereafter referred to as Black) (70.8% female; mean [SD] age, 78.4 [8.2] years), and 34\u202f021 non-Hispanic White (hereafter referred to as White) (59.3% female; mean [SD] age, 77.0 [9.1] years) individuals. There was a general, stepwise pattern of ORs for APOE*4 genotypes and AD risk across race and ethnicity groups. Odds ratios for APOE*34 and AD risk attenuated following East Asian (OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 3.99-5.17),White (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 3.27-3.65), Black (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.90-2.49) and Hispanic (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.65-2.18) individuals. Similarly, ORs for APOE*22+23 and AD risk attenuated following White (OR, 0.53, 95% CI, 0.48-0.58), Black (OR, 0.69, 95% CI, 0.57-0.84), and Hispanic (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.10) individuals, with no association for Hispanic individuals. Deviating from the global pattern of ORs, APOE*22+23 was not associated with AD risk in East Asian individuals (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.23). Global population ancestry could not explain why Hispanic individuals showed APOE associations with less pronounced AD risk compared with Black and White individuals. Within Black individuals, decreased global African ancestry or increased global European ancestry showed a pattern of APOE*4 dosage associated with increasing AD risk, but no such pattern was apparent for APOE*2 dosage with AD risk.

To assess if ApoE4 carriers show accelerated amyloid-related tau spreading and propose amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) thresholds at which tau spreading accelerates in ApoE4 carriers vs noncarriers. This cohort study including combined ApoE genotyping, amyloid PET, and longitudinal tau PET from 2 independent samples: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n\u2009=\u2009237; collected from April 2015 to August 2022) and Avid-A05 (n\u2009=\u2009130; collected from December 2013 to July 2017) with a mean (SD) tau PET follow-up time of 1.9 (0.96) years in ADNI and 1.4 (0.23) years in Avid-A05. ADNI is an observational multicenter Alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative and Avid-A05 an observational clinical trial. Participants classified as cognitively normal (152 in ADNI and 77 in Avid-A05) or mildly cognitively impaired (107 in ADNI and 53 in Avid-A05) were selected based on ApoE genotyping, amyloid-PET, and longitudinal tau PET data availability. Participants with ApoE \u03b52/\u03b54 genotype or classified as having dementia were excluded. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity templates were based on 42 healthy participants in ADNI. Mediation of amyloid PET on the association between ApoE4 status and subsequent tau PET increase through Braak stage regions and interaction between ApoE4 status and amyloid PET with annual tau PET increase through Braak stage regions and connectivity-based spreading stages (tau epicenter connectivity ranked regions). The mean (SD) age was 73.9 (7.35) years among the 237 ADNI participants and 70.2 (9.7) years among the 130 Avid-A05 participants. A total of 107 individuals in ADNI (45.1%) and 45 in Avid-A05 (34.6%) were ApoE4 carriers.

Further, we found a significant association between ApoE4 status by amyloid PET interaction and annual tau PET increases consistently through early Braak- and connectivity-based stages where amyloid-related tau accumulation was accelerated in ApoE4carriers vs noncarriers at lower centiloid thresholds, corrected for age and sex. The findings in this study indicate that amyloid-related tau accumulation was accelerated in ApoE4 carriers at lower amyloid levels, suggesting that ApoE4 may facilitate earlier amyloid-driven tau spreading across connected brain regions. Possible therapeutic implications might be further investigated to determine when best to prevent tau spreading and thus cognitive decline depending on ApoE4 status.",

        "AbstractText": "Insulin signaling cascade in peripheral insulin sensitive tissues regulates whole-body glucose metabolism. Any deregulation in this pathway leads to insulin resistance, ultimately leading to metabolic diseases like diabetes-I, -II, obesity, etc. Insulin signaling in the brain has also been studied for many decades, and associated with many primary functions like maintaining synaptic plasticity, regulating cognition, circadian rhythm etc. Importantly, neuronal insulin signaling has also been associated with regulating neuronal glucose uptake. Any impairment in neuronal insulin signaling affecting neuronal glucose uptake has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disorder, which is now being termed as type-3 diabetes. Since the criticality lies in proper signaling cascade, determining important points of deregulation is important. In this review, we have discussed some critical points of such deregulation, dividing them into two classes: kinases and phosphatases. We have highlighted their individual roles in neuronal insulin signaling, possible implications in neuronal insulin resistance. Future strategies in targeting these nodes in neuronal insulin signaling might be helpful in potential therapeutic opportunities to overcome neuronal insulin resistance and related neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Agitation is a prevalent, distressing, and burdensome manifestation of Alzheimer dementia in need of an efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated treatment. To confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole in patients with agitation in Alzheimer dementia. This randomized clinical trial was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel-arm trial that ran from May 2018 to June 2022 at 123 clinical trial sites in Europe and the United States. Participants included patients with agitation in Alzheimer dementia in a care facility or community-based setting. Stable Alzheimer disease medications were permitted. In this 2-arm trial, patients were randomized to receive oral brexpiprazole or placebo (2:1 ratio) for 12 weeks. Within the brexpiprazole arm, patients were further randomized to receive fixed doses of 2 mg/d or 3 mg/d in a 1:2 ratio. The primary end point was change in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total score (which measures the frequency of 29 agitated behaviors) from baseline to week 12 for brexpiprazole, 2 or 3 mg, vs placebo. Safety was assessed by standard measures, including treatment-emergent adverse events. A total of 345 patients were randomized to receive brexpiprazole (n\u2009=\u2009228) or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009117); completion rates were 198 (86.8%) for brexpiprazole and 104 (88.9%) for placebo. Mean (SD) age was 74.0 (7.5) years, and 195 of 345 patients were female (56.5%). Patients receiving brexpiprazole, 2 or 3 mg (n\u2009=\u2009225), demonstrated statistically significantly greater improvement than those taking placebo (n\u2009=\u2009116) in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total score from baseline to week 12 (brexpiprazole baseline, 80.6, mean change, -22.6; placebo baseline, 79.2, mean change, -17.3; least-squares mean difference, -5.32; 95% CI, -8.77 to -1.87; P\u2009=\u2009.003; Cohen d effect size, 0.35). No treatment-emergent adverse events had an incidence of 5% or more with brexpiprazole and greater incidence than placebo. The proportion of patients who discontinued because of adverse events was 12 of 226 (5.3%) for brexpiprazole and 5 of 116 (4.3%) for placebo. In this study, patients with Alzheimer dementia who took brexpiprazole, 2 or 3 mg, showed a statistically significant improvement vs placebo in agitation over 12 weeks. Brexpiprazole was generally well tolerated over 12 weeks in this vulnerable patient population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03548584.",

The current study on whether pathological changes of AD extend to the enteric nervous system (ENS) is still in its infancy. In this study, we found enteric A\u03b2 deposition, intestinal dysfunction, and colonic inflammation in the young APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, these mice exhibited cholinergic and nitrergic signaling pathways damages and enteric neuronal loss. Our data show that A\u03b242 treatment remarkably affected the gene expression of cultured myenteric neurons and the spontaneous contraction of intestinal smooth muscles. The intra-colon administration of A\u03b242 induced ENS dysfunction, brain gliosis, and \u03b2-amyloidosis-like changes in the wild-type mice. Our results suggest that ENS mirrors the neuropathology observed in AD brains, and intestinal pathological changes may represent the prodromal events, which contribute to brain pathology in AD.

Data came from the Systematic Multi-Domain Alzheimer's Risk Reduction Trial, a randomized controlled trial of a multi-domain intervention in higher-risk older adults (aged 70-89). A questionnaire was administered to participants (n = 156; 90.7% response rate) between May 2020 and March 2021. The data show a significant decline in social activity, physical activity, and mood among respondents. Compared to living with others, living alone was associated with worsened physical activity, diet, and subjective memory/thinking, adjusted for sex and age. These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated several risk factors for dementia in older adults, particularly in those living alone.",

        "AbstractText": "Recent research indicates that multiple sclerosis is preceded by a prodromal phase with elevated levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), a marker of axonal injury. The effect of environmental risk factors on the extent of axonal injury during this prodrome is unknown. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study was to determine if HHV-6A serostatus is associated with the level of sNfL in the multiple sclerosis prodrome, which would support a causative role of HHV-6A. A nested case-control study was performed by crosslinking multiple sclerosis registries with Swedish biobanks. Individuals with biobank samples collected before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis were included as cases. Controls without multiple sclerosis were randomly selected, matched for biobank, sex, sampling date and age. Serostatus of HHV-6A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was analysed with a bead-based multiplex assay. The concentration of sNfL was analysed with Single molecule array technology. The association between HHV-6A serology and sNfL was assessed by stratified t-tests and linear regressions, adjusted for EBV serostatus and sampling age. Within-pair ratios of HHV-6A seroreactivity and sNfL were calculated for each case and its matched control. To assess the temporal relationship between HHV-6A antibodies and sNfL, these ratios were plotted against the time to the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis and compared using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing regressions with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Samples from 519 matched case-control pairs were included. In cases, seropositivity of HHV-6A was significantly associated with the level of sNfL (+11%, 95% CI 0.2-24%, P\u2009=\u20090.045), and most pronounced in the younger half of the cases (+24%, 95% CI 6-45%, P\u2009=\u20090.007). No such associations were observed among the controls. Increasing seroreactivity against HHV-6A was detectable before the rise of sNfL (significant within-pair ratios from 13.6 years vs 6.6 years before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis). In this study, we describe the association between HHV-6A antibodies and the degree of axonal injury in the multiple sclerosis prodrome. The findings indicate that elevated HHV-6A antibodies both precede and are associated with a higher degree of axonal injury, supporting the hypothesis that HHV-6A infection may contribute to multiple sclerosis development in a proportion of cases.",

        "AbstractText": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a key physiological component of the central nervous system (CNS), maintaining nutrients, clearing waste, and protecting the brain from pathogens. The inherent barrier properties of the BBB pose a challenge for therapeutic drug delivery into the CNS to treat neurological diseases. Impaired BBB function has been related to neurological disease. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the deposition of amyloid in the cerebral vasculature leading to a compromised BBB, is a co-morbidity in most cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that BBB dysfunction or breakdown may be involved in neurodegeneration. Due to limited access to human BBB tissue, the mechanisms that contribute to proper BBB function and BBB degeneration remain unknown. To address these limitations, we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived BBB (iBBB) by incorporating endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes in a 3D matrix. The iBBB self-assembles to recapitulate the anatomy and cellular interactions present in the BBB. Seeding iBBBs with amyloid captures key aspects of CAA. Additionally, the iBBB offers a flexible platform to modulate genetic and environmental factors implicated in cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration, to investigate how genetics and lifestyle affect disease risk. Finally, the iBBB can be used for drug screening and medicinal chemistry studies to optimize therapeutic\u00a0delivery to the CNS. In this protocol, we describe the differentiation of the three types of cells (endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes) arising from human pluripotent stem cells, how to assemble the differentiated cells into the iBBB, and how to model CAA in vitro using exogenous amyloid. This model overcomes the challenge of studying live human brain tissue with a system that has both biological fidelity and experimental flexibility, and enables the interrogation of the human BBB and its role in neurodegeneration.",

Beyond addressing the fundamental problems, it has been used as a fantastic model organism for human disease research. Being an insect, Drosophila has a robust and advanced olfactory system that has been used many times as a model neuronal circuit to study fundamental questions in neurobiology. The circuit is well-explored at anatomical, physiological, and functional levels. It provides several advantages for the study of neurobiological disorders, such as spatiotemporally regulated misexpression or knockdown of disease proteins, genetic tractability, well-studied neuroanatomy, simple behavioural training paradigms, and quantifiable assays. Hence, Drosophila olfaction has been a favourite choice for the study of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome, etc. This review aims to discuss earlier progress and future scope in using the Drosophila olfactory system for modelling human neurological pathophysiology for conducting fundamental and applied research. A major goal of research in biological science is to alleviate human disease burden. Diverse experimental systems are required to address different aspects of disease aetiology. Drosophila is one of the finest in vivo systems; its olfactory system is arguably the most well-characterized circuit for modelling human neurological disorders. A vast amount of research has been conducted to decipher cellular, molecular, and even cognitive aspects of human disorders using the Drosophila olfactory system.

Methods and Results Using 2013 to 2017 US Medicare claims linked to Minimum Data Set records, we conducted a retrospective cohort study. We identified DOAC initiators (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban) aged \u226565\u2009years with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation residing in a nursing home. We estimated inverse-probability of treatment weights for DOAC dose using propensity scores. We examined safety (hospitalization for major bleeding) and effectiveness outcomes (all-cause mortality, thrombosis [myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, venous thromboembolism]). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs using cause-specific hazard-regression models. Of 21\u2009878 DOAC initiators, 48% received reduced dosing. The mean age of residents was 82.0\u2009years, 66% were female, and 31% had moderate/severe cognitive impairment. After estimating inverse-probability of treatment weights, standard dosing was associated with a higher rate of bleeding (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.03-1.37]; 9.4 versus 8.0 events per 100 person-years). Standard-dose therapy was associated with the highest rates of bleeding among those aged >80\u2009years (9.1 versus 6.7 events per 100\u2009person-years) and with a body mass index <30\u2009kg/m2 (9.4 versus 7.4 events per 100\u2009person-years). There was no association of dosing with mortality (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.96-1.06]) or thrombotic events (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.96-1.41]). Conclusions In this nationwide study of nursing home residents with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, we found a higher rate of bleeding and little difference in effectiveness of standard versus reduced-dose DOAC treatment.

AD patients usually present symptoms, such as cognitive dysfunction, progressive memory loss, and other manifestations. With the increasing number of AD cases worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop effective drug treatments.

In this review, we summarized both cellular and animal studies and described the mechanism of action of curcumin in altering the pathological features of AD. Curcumin attenuates the formation of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and promotes its decomposition, reduces the phosphorylation of tau, improves its clearance rate, and binds with copper to reduce cholesterol. It changes the activity of microglia, suppresses acetylcholinesterase, regulates insulin signal transduction, and exhibits antioxidant properties. Studies have found that curcumin can promote nerve repair and has a significant effect on AD. However, the low bioavailability of curcumin may hinder its use as a therapeutic agent.

Water maze and immunohistochemical experiments demonstrated that AST significantly improved the cognitive level of APP/PS1 mice and reduced A\u03b2 deposition in the cortex. After the dietary intake of AST, the composition and level of 84 GLS molecular species in the mouse cortex were determined using the LC-MS strategy. The results showed that the total GLS was reduced, most complex GLS was decreased, and simple GLS (GM3 and GM1a) was increased in the APP/PS1 mouse cortex. Notably, F-AST mainly regulated complex GLS (p < 0.001), whereas AST-DHA primarily reacted with simple GLS (p < 0.001). OAc-GQ1a(38:1), OAc-GQ1a(36:1), GD1a(36:1), and GM3(38:1) decreased 3.73, 2.31, and 2.29-fold and increased 3.54-fold, respectively, and were identified as potential AD biomarkers in the cortices of APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, the AST diet significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of GLS synthesizing genes (st3gal5, st8sia1, b3galt4, st3fal2, and soat) and siae (p < 0.05) and down-regulated that of the GLS catabolizing gene hexa (p < 0.01).

Prior studies indicate that the presence of atherosclerosis, the pathogenic basis of CVD, is linked with dementias. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias are a major public health challenge in the United States. Recent studies indicate that \u22483.7\u2009million Americans \u226565\u2009years of age had clinical AD in 2017, with projected increases to 9.3\u2009million by 2060. Treatment options for AD remain limited. Development of disease-modifying therapies are challenging due, in part, to the long preclinical window of AD. The preclinical incubation period of AD starts in midlife, providing a critical window for identification and optimization of AD risk factors. Studies link AD with CVD risk factors such as hypertension, inflammation, and dyslipidemia. Both AD and CVD are progressive diseases with decades-long development periods. CVD can clinically manifest several years earlier than AD, making CVD and its risk factors a potential predictor of future AD. The current review focuses on the state of literature on molecular and metabolic pathways modulating the heart-brain axis underlying the potential association of midlife CVD risk factors and their effect on AD and related dementias.

Non-drug patient-centred care is first-line treatment, but we need other treatment when this fails. Current evidence is sparse on safer and effective alternatives to antipsychotics. To assess clinical and cost-effectiveness and safety of mirtazapine and carbamazepine in treating agitation in dementia. Pragmatic, phase III, multicentre, double-blind, superiority, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness of mirtazapine over 12 weeks (carbamazepine arm discontinued). Twenty-six UK secondary care centres. Eligibility: probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, agitation unresponsive to non-drug treatment, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory score\u2005\u2265\u200545. Mirtazapine (target 45\u2009mg), carbamazepine (target 300\u2009mg) and placebo. Primary: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory score 12 weeks post randomisation. Main economic outcome evaluation: incremental cost per six-point difference in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory score at 12 weeks, from health and social care system perspective. Data from participants and informants at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Long-term follow-up Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory data collected by telephone from informants at 6 and 12 months. Participants allocated 1 : 1 : 1 ratio (to discontinuation of the carbamazepine arm, 1 : 1 thereafter) to receive placebo or carbamazepine or mirtazapine, with treatment as usual. Random allocation was block stratified by centre and residence type with random block lengths of three or six (after discontinuation of carbamazepine, two or four). Double-blind, with drug and placebo identically encapsulated. Referring clinicians, participants, trial management team and research workers who did assessments were masked to group allocation. Two hundred and forty-four participants recruited and randomised (102 mirtazapine, 102 placebo, 40 carbamazepine). The carbamazepine arm was discontinued due to slow overall recruitment; carbamazepine/placebo analyses are therefore statistically underpowered and not detailed in the abstract. Mean difference placebo-mirtazapine (-1.74, 95% confidence interval -7.17 to 3.69; p\u2005=\u20050.53). Harms: The number of controls with adverse events (65/102, 64%) was similar to the mirtazapine group (67/102, 66%). However, there were more deaths in the mirtazapine group (n\u2005=\u20057) by week 16 than in the control group (n\u2005=\u20051). Post hoc analysis suggests this was of marginal statistical significance (p\u2005=\u20050.065); this difference did not persist at 6- and 12-month assessments. At 12 weeks, the costs of unpaid care by the dyadic carer were significantly higher in the mirtazapine than placebo group [difference: \u00a31120 (95% confidence interval \u00a356 to \u00a32184)]. In the cost-effectiveness analyses, mean raw and adjusted outcome scores and costs of the complete cases samples showed no differences between groups. Our study has four important potential limitations: (1) we dropped the proposed carbamazepine group; (2) the trial was not powered to investigate a mortality difference between the groups; (3) recruitment beyond February 2020, was constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic; and (4) generalisability is limited by recruitment of participants from old-age psychiatry services and care homes. The data suggest mirtazapine is not clinically or cost-effective (compared to placebo) for agitation in dementia. There is little reason to recommend mirtazapine for people with dementia with agitation. Effective and cost-effective management strategies for agitation in dementia are needed where non-pharmacological approaches are unsuccessful. This trial is registered as ISRCTN17411897/NCT03031184. This project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 27, No. 23. See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information. It is common for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease to experience agitation, for example feeling restless or unsettled. If left untreated, agitation can lead to poorer quality of life and increased hospitalisation and strain for family carers. Often these symptoms are treated with medications that are usually used to manage psychosis (antipsychotic drugs), but such medication has limited effectiveness and can cause serious adverse effects to patients, including risk of increased death. Two medications that are already commonly prescribed for other health issues, mirtazapine (an antidepressant) and carbamazepine (a drug used to treat epilepsy), had been identified as a possible alternative way of treating agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s disease that might not have the harms associated with antipsychotic medication. In this study, we compared the effects of giving mirtazapine or carbamazepine with a dummy drug (placebo) in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease who were experiencing agitation. The results of the study showed that neither medication was any more effective than the placebo in reducing agitation over 12 weeks in terms of improving symptoms, or in economic terms. Mirtazapine may lead to additional carer costs as compared to placebo. The study findings are stronger for mirtazapine than carbamazepine because the carbamazepine arm was stopped when it had recruited less than half the numbers needed. That was done because the study was not recruiting quickly enough to support both the mirtazapine and the carbamazepine arms. The findings from this study show that mirtazapine should not be recommended to treat agitation in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. More work is needed to formulate effective ways and to test new drug and non-drug treatments for agitation in dementia.",

We used a variety of in silico tools to investigate the transcript-level mutational impact of exonic missense rare variations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) on protein function and to identify potential druggable protein cavities that correspond to potential therapeutic targets for the management of AD. According to the NIA-AA (National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association) framework, we selected three AD biomarker genes (APP, NEFL, and MAPT). We systematically screened transcript-level exonic rare SNPs from these genes with a minor allele frequency of 1% in 1KGD (1000 Genomes Project Database) and gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database). With downstream functional effect predictions, a single variation (rs182024939: K > N) of the MAPT gene with nine transcript SNPs was identified as the most pathogenic variation from the large dataset of mutations. The machine learning consensus classifier predictor categorized these transcript-level SNPs as the most deleterious variations, resulting in a large decrease in protein structural stability (\u0394\u0394G kcal/mol). The bioactive flavonoid library was screened for drug-likeness and toxicity risk. Virtual screening of eligible flavonoids was performed using the MAPT protein. Identification of druggable protein-binding cavities showed VAL305, GLU655, and LYS657 as consensus-interacting residues present in the MAPT-docked top-ranked flavonoid compounds. The MM/PB(GB)SA analysis indicated hesperetin (-5.64 kcal/mol), eriodictyol (-5.63 kcal/mol), and sakuranetin (-5.60 kcal/mol) as the best docked flavonoids with the near-native binding pose. The findings of this study provide important insights into the potential of hesperetin as a promising flavonoid that can be utilized for further rational drug design and lead optimization to open new gateways in the field of AD therapeutics.",

        "AbstractText": "The structure and function of the brain greatly rely on different signaling pathways. The wide variety of biological processes, including neurogenesis, axonal remodeling, the development and maintenance of pre- and postsynaptic terminals, and excitatory synaptic transmission, depends on combined actions of these molecular pathways. From that point of view, it is important to investigate signaling pathways and their crosstalk in order to better understand the formation of toxic proteins during neurodegeneration. With recent discoveries, it is established that the modulation of several pathological events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Wnt signaling, 5'-adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, silent mating-type information regulator 2 homologue 1) are central to the key findings. These include decreased amyloid formation and inflammation, mitochondrial dynamics control, and enhanced neural stability. This review intends to emphasize the importance of these signaling pathways, which collectively determine the fate of neurons in AD in several ways. This review will also focus on the role of novel synthetic and natural bioactive molecules in balancing the intricate crosstalk among different pathways in order to prolong the longevity of AD patients.",

The least significant difference (LSD) post hoc test was used to analyze the difference pattern between means. Participants in both conditions reported healthier dietary behavior and lower level of stress from pre-intervention to the post-intervention. These effects were not maintained at one-month follow up. An online educational intervention may improve the health and well-being of informal caregivers of people with AD. Further research is necessary to determine which specific intervention components to include and what strategies may help participants maintain improved health behaviors. This program focused on the health and well-being of informal caregivers of individuals with AD rather than on emphasizing how caregivers can perform their caregiving duties better.

We used longitudinal data for 3,299 cognitively healthy UK residents aged 65+. We used data on AARC and SCD assessed in 2019, and cognitive tasks assessed in 2019, 2020, and 2021. We used latent growth curve modeling, latent class growth analysis, and growth mixture modeling. For VR, multiple growth trajectories were not evident. Mean VR at baseline was 37.45; this remained stable over time. Higher AARC-gains in cognition (mean intercept\u2009=\u2009-0.23; 95%CI: -0.31; -0.16), higher AARC-losses in cognition (mean intercept\u2009=\u2009-0.37; 95%CI: -0.46; -0.28), and lower SCD (mean intercept\u2009=\u20092.92; 95%CI: 2.58; 3.58) were associated with poorer VR at baseline. A three-class growth mixture model-class varying best represented trajectories of WM. In Class 1 (N\u2009=\u2009182) mean WM at baseline was 31.20; this decreased by 2.48 points each year. In Class 2 (N\u2009=\u2009119) mean WM at baseline was 23.12; this increased by 3.28 points each year. In Class 3 (N\u2009=\u20092,998) mean WM at baseline was 30.11; and it remained stable.

We aimed to investigate the longitudinal associations of baseline objectively assessed sleep quality and duration, as well as time in bed, with verbal memory capacity over a 7-9\u2009year period. Participants are a well-characterized subsample of 148 persons (mean age at baseline: 72.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7\u2009years) from the Cretan Aging Cohort. Based on comprehensive neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation at baseline, participants were diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; n\u2009=\u200979) or found to be cognitively unimpaired (CNI; n\u2009=\u200969). Sleep quality/quantity was estimated from a 3-day consecutive actigraphy recording, whereas verbal memory capacity was examined using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Greek Passage Memory Test at baseline and follow-up. Panel models were applied to the data using AMOS including several sociodemographic and clinical covariates. Sleep efficiency at baseline directly predicted subsequent memory performance in the total group (immediate passage recall: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.266, p\u2009=\u20090.001; immediate word list recall: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.172, p\u2009=\u20090.01; delayed passage retrieval: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.214, p\u2009=\u20090.002) with the effects in Passage Memory reaching significance in both clinical groups. Wake after sleep onset time directly predicted follow-up immediate passage recall in the total sample (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.211, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and in the MCI group (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.235, p\u2009=\u20090.02). In the total sample, longer 24-h sleep duration was associated with reduced memory performance indirectly through increased sleep duration at follow-up (immediate passage recall: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.045, p\u2009=\u20090.01; passage retention index: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.051, p\u2009=\u20090.01; RAVLT-delayed recall: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.048, p\u2009=\u20090.009; RAVLT-retention index:\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.066, p\u2009=\u20090.004). Similar indirect effects were found for baseline 24-h time in bed. Indirect effects of sleep duration/time in bed were found predominantly in the MCI group. Findings corroborate and expand previous work suggesting that poor sleep quality and long sleep duration predict worse memory function in elderly. Timely interventions to improve sleep could help prevent or delay age-related memory decline among non-demented elderly.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Modulating mitochondrial calcium channels (TRPM2/MCU/NCX) as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders.",
        "AbstractText": "Efficient cellular communication is essential for the brain to regulate diverse functions like muscle contractions, memory formation and recall, decision-making, and task execution. This communication is facilitated by rapid signaling through electrical and chemical messengers, including voltage-gated ion channels and neurotransmitters. These messengers elicit broad responses by propagating action potentials and mediating synaptic transmission. Calcium influx and efflux are essential for releasing neurotransmitters and regulating synaptic transmission. Mitochondria, which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and the energy generation process, also interact with the endoplasmic reticulum to store and regulate cytoplasmic calcium levels. The number, morphology, and distribution of mitochondria in different cell types vary based on energy demands. Mitochondrial damage can cause excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Mitophagy is a selective process that targets and degrades damaged mitochondria via autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Defects in mitophagy can lead to a buildup of ROS and cell death. Numerous studies have attempted to characterize the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinocerebellar ataxia, and aging. Interventional strategies to reduce mitochondrial damage and accumulation could serve as a therapeutic target, but further research is needed to unravel this potential. This review offers an overview of calcium signaling related to mitochondria in various neuronal cells. It critically examines recent findings, exploring the potential roles that mitochondrial dysfunction might play in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Furthermore, the review identifies existing gaps in knowledge to guide the direction of future research.",

While many tools have been developed to assess levels of apathy in pathology, no standardized measure of apathy in healthy people exists. Therefore, this study aimed to validate the French version of the Apathy Motivation Index (f-AMI). The results of 729 participants were analyzed using an exploratory factorial analysis. Preliminary analyses suggested that the three domains of apathy extracted in the original AMI scale-behavioral activation (BA), social motivation (SM), and emotional sensitivity (ES)-could be found also in the f-AMI. A further exploratory analysis showed that a higher number of factors could be extracted, particularly for women. Specifically, both social and emotional factors could be divided into two sub-factors: (1) social motivation toward strangers or toward an acquaintance and (2) self-directed emotional sensitivity directed toward others. Regarding construct validity, the scores of f-AMI were correlated with the French Dimensional Apathy Scale results. Concerning the divergent validity, emotional sensitivity in apathy is different from depression, anhedonia, and fatigue levels. These results suggest that the f-AMI can be used to assess levels of apathy in healthy adults.",

        "AbstractText": "SRY-box transcription factor 21 antisense divergent transcript 1 (SOX21-AS1) is a multifaceted long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that plays diverse roles in both neoplastic conditions and Alzheimer's disease. Its aberrant expression intricately regulates a wide spectrum of cellular processes, spanning from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, migration, metastasis, and stemness to drug resistance. SOX21-AS1 achieves these effects through its involvement in the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, modulation of downstream genes, and regulation of critical pathways, including PI3K/AKT, Hippo, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, and ERK signaling. Of significant clinical relevance, SOX21-AS1 expression has shown robust correlations with various clinical-pathological features. Moreover, it has demonstrated promising prognostic and diagnostic potential across a spectrum of tumors, as evidenced by existing literature and TCGA pan-cancer analyses. In Alzheimer's disease, SOX21-AS1 assumes a distinctive role. It influences neuronal viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress by interacting with miR-107 and miR-132, and affecting the PI3K/AKT and Wnt signaling pathways. This comprehensive review sheds light on the functions of SOX21-AS1 and the regulated mechanisms underpinning its impact on neoplastic conditions and Alzheimer's disease. It underscores the clinical significance of SOX21-AS1 and positions it as a promising therapeutic target in both the oncological and neurodegenerative domains.",

        "AbstractText": "The relationship between epilepsy and dementia is currently a topic of great interest. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of dementia diagnoses among patients of a large level 4 university epilepsy center. In this retrospective monocentric study conducted at the Department of Epileptology of the University Hospital Bonn, we searched for dementia-related terms in a total of 145,501 medical letters from 40,360 adult patients who were seen between 2003 and 2021. Files with at least one hit were selected and analyzed with regard to diagnoses, age, age at epilepsy onset, and the question as to whether epilepsy preceded or followed the dementia diagnosis. Among the medical letters of 513 patients, dementia-related terms were found. The letters of 12.7% of these patients stated a dementia diagnosis, 6.6% were suspected of having dementia, 4.9% had mild cognitive impairment, and 6.6% had other neurodegenerative diseases without dementia. Taking all 40,360 patients into account, the prevalence of diagnosed or suspected dementia was 0.25%. An older age (\u226560 years) and late-onset epilepsy (\u226560 years), but not a longer epilepsy duration, increased the odds of dementia by 6.1 (CI 3.5-10.7) and 2.9 (CI 1.7-4.7), respectively. Additionally, vascular, metabolic, inflammatory, and behavioral mood-related comorbidities were commonly observed. Epilepsy tended to precede (23.2%) rather than follow (8.1%) the dementia diagnosis. Despite the clear limitations of a selection bias and the potential underdiagnosis of dementia and underestimation of its prevalence when relying on the medical letters from a specialized center which rather focuses on epilepsy-related issues, the findings of this study offer valuable insights from the perspective of an epilepsy center. In this setting, the prevalence of dementia in epilepsy is rather low. However, physicians should be aware that the risk of dementia is higher in the elderly, in late-onset epilepsies, and when comorbid risk factors exist. Seizures can also be an early sign of a neurodegenerative disease. Future research should explicitly screen for dementia in patients with epilepsy and stratify them according to their underlying pathologies and comorbidities.",

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Mann-Whitney U, intra-class (ICC) and Spearman ranked correlations, Bland-Altman plots and Kappa scores, Chi-square and Fisher exact probability test, and multiple-logistic regression were focused primarily on spindle duration and NRH and the frequencies assigned to the four normal/abnormal spindle duration/NRH combinations. ANOVA identified group differences in age, sleep efficiency, REM, NRH (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and sleep time (p\u2009=\u20090.015), Spindle duration and NRH each demonstrated good night-to-night reliabilities (ICC\u2009=\u20090.95 and 0.75, Kappa\u2009=\u20090.93 and 0.66, respectively) and together exhibited an association in the PD and LBD groups only (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

Besides, the available systemic therapies for AD are still inadequate. Due to the insufficient therapeutic options, new treatment strategies are urgently needed to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic effect. Marine bio-resources have been accepted as one of the most economically viable and sustainable sources with potential applications for drug discovery and development. In this study, a marine cyanobacteria-Synechococcus sp. XM-24 was selected as the object of research, to systematically investigate its therapeutic potential mechanisms for AD. The major active compounds derived from the Synechococcus sp. biomass were identified via pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and 22 compounds were identified in this strain. The most abundant chemical compounds was (E)-octadec-11-enoic acid, with the peak area of 30.6%. Follow by tridecanoic acid, 12-methyl- and hexadecanoic acid, with a peak area of 23.26% and 18.23%, respectively. GC-MS analysis also identified indolizine, isoquinoline, 3,4-dihydro- and Phthalazine, 1-methyl-, as well as alkene and alkane from the strain. After the chemical toxicity test, 10 compounds were finally collected to do the further analysis. Then, network pharmacology and molecular docking were adopted to systematically study the potential anti-AD mechanism of these compounds. Based on the analysis, the 10 Synechococcus-derived active compounds could interact with 128 related anti-AD targets. Among them, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3) were the major targets. Furthermore, the compounds N-capric acid isopropyl ester, (E)-octadec-11-enoic acid, and 2H-Pyran-2,4(3H)-dione, dihydro-6-methyl- obtained higher degrees in the compounds-intersection targets network analysis, indicating these compounds may play more important role in the process of anti-AD. In addition, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that these active compounds exert the anti-AD effects mainly through PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and ras signaling pathway. Our study identified Synechococcus-derived bioactive compounds have the potential for application to AD by targeting multiple targets and related pathways, which will provide a foundation for future research on applications of marine cyanobacteria in the functional drug industry.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the leading contributors of dementia globally with approximately 60-70% of its cases. Current research is focused on the mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is associated with cognitive decline but does not disrupt routine activities. Event-related potential (ERP) research is essential in screening patients with MCI. Low-density channel electroencephalography (EEG) is frequently used due to its convenience, portability, and affordability, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. Despite extensive research on neural biomarkers for cognitive impairment, there is a considerable gap in understanding the effects on early stages of cognitive processes, particularly when combining physiological and cognitive markers using portable devices. The present study aimed to examine cognitive shortfalls and behavioral changes in patients with MCI using prefrontal selective attention ERP recorded from a prefrontal two-channel EEG device. We assessed cognitive decline using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB). We administered auditory selective attention tasks to 598 elderly participants, including those with MCI (160) and cognitively normal (CN) individuals (407). We conducted statistical analyses such as independent t-tests, Pearson's correlations, and univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses to assess group differences and associations between neuropsychological tests, ERP measures, behavioral measures, and MCI prevalence. Our findings revealed that patients with MCI demonstrated slower information-processing abilities, and exhibited poorer task execution, characterized by reduced accuracy, increased errors, and higher variability in response time, compared to CN adults. Multiple logistic regression analyses confirmed the association between some ERP and behavioral measures with MCI prevalence, independent of demographic and neuropsychological factors. A relationship was observed between neuropsychological scores, ERP, and behavioral measures. The slower information processing abilities, and poor task execution in the MCI group compared to the CN individuals suggests flawed neurological changes and reduced attentional maintenance during cognitive processing, respectively. Hence, the utilization of portable EEG devices to capture prefrontal selective attention ERPs, in combination with behavioral assessments, holds promise for the identification of mild cognitive deficits and neural alterations in individuals with MCI. This approach could potentially augment the traditional neuropsychological tests during clinical screening for MCI.",

        "AbstractText": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a prodromal state of dementia. Abnormal values of cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (CSF-AD-b) have been associated with a higher risk of conversion to dementia (due to Alzheimer's disease), but studies evaluating the ability of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in this task are lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between MoCA and CSF-AD-b, as well as the ability of those tools to predict conversion to dementia. Taking advantage of our MCI cohort with biological characterization on longitudinal follow-up (180 patients followed for 62.6 months during which 41.3% converted), we computed MoCA and MMSE z-scores, using Portuguese normative data. The performance in MoCA z-score was correlated with CSF-AD-b and the relative time to conversion and risk according to baseline characteristics were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models. MoCA z-scores were correlated with A\u03b242 (p\u200a=\u200a0.026), t-tau (p\u200a=\u200a0.033), and p-tau (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). Impaired MMSE (p\u200a<\u200a0.001) and MoCA z-scores (p\u200a=\u200a0.019), decreased A\u03b242 (p\u200a<\u200a0.001) and increased t-tau (p\u200a<\u200a0.001) and p-tau (p\u200a<\u200a0.001) were associated with shorter estimated time of conversion. A\u03b242 (p\u200a<\u200a0.001) and MMSE z-scores (p\u200a=\u200a0.029) were independent predictors of conversion. For those with at least 9 years of education, MoCA z-score (p\u200a=\u200a0.004) (but not MMSE) was an independent predictor of conversion as well as A\u03b242. This study confirms the role of CSF-AD-b, namely A\u03b242, in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia and suggests the utility of MoCA in predicting conversion in highly educated subjects, supporting its use in the evaluation of MCI patients.",

Most of the CCD and CNTB scores were predicted by age and years of education, with some tests only predicted by age or showing a ceiling effect. The comparison of normative data between the two samples confirmed the favorable cross-cultural properties of these instruments, with only some differences in processing speed and executive functioning scores.

        "AbstractText": "In 2018, the Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) was established to bring together Australia's leading dementia researchers, people with living experience and clinicians to transform research and clinical care in the field. To address dementia diagnosis, treatment, and care, ADNeT has established three core initiatives: the Clinical Quality Registry (CQR), Memory Clinics, and Screening for Trials. Collectively, the initiatives have developed an integrated clinical and research community, driving practice excellence in this field, leading to novel innovations in diagnostics, clinical care, professional development, quality and harmonization of healthcare, clinical trials, and translation of research into practice. Australia now has a national Registry for Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia with 55 participating clinical sites, an extensive map of memory clinic services, national Memory and Cognition Clinic Guidelines and specialized screening for trials sites in five states. This paper provides an overview of ADNeT's achievements to date and future directions. With the increase in dementia cases expected over coming decades, and with recent advances in plasma biomarkers and amyloid lowering therapies, the nationally coordinated initiatives and partnerships ADNeT has established are critical for increased national prevention efforts, co-ordinated implementation of emerging treatments for Alzheimer's disease, innovation of early and accurate diagnosis, driving continuous improvements in clinical care and patient outcome and access to post-diagnostic support and clinical trials. For a heterogenous disorder such as dementia, which is now the second leading cause of death in Australia following cardiovascular disease, the case for adequate investment into research and development has grown even more compelling.",

We aimed to identify the differences in non-cognitive factors according to AD stages and their involvement in basic and instrumental ADL performance by using intrinsic capacity (IC) in groups with cognition ranging from normal to moderate or severe AD. We enrolled 6397 patients aged\u226565 years who visited our memory clinic. Non-cognitive IC was assessed using the locomotion, sensory, vitality, and psychological domains. Multiple logistic regression was performed to identify how non-cognitive IC declines over the AD course and examine the correlation between non-cognitive IC and basic and instrumental ADL performance. Non-cognitive IC declined from the initial AD stage and was significantly correlated with both basic and instrumental ADL performance from the aMCI stage through all AD stages. In particular, the relationship between IC and basic ADL was stronger in mild and moderate to severe AD than in the aMCI stage. On the other hand, the relationship between IC and instrumental ADL was stronger in aMCI than in later AD stages. The results show non-cognitive factors, which decline from the aMCI stage, are correlated with ADL performance from the aMCI stage to almost all AD stages. Considering that the relationship strength varied by ADL type and AD stage, an approach tailored to ADL type and AD stage targeting multiple risk factors is likely needed for effectively preventing ADL performance declines.",

This study aimed to clarify whether the spontaneous jugular vein reflux (JVR) is associated with cognitive impairment and incident dementia. Patients with any evidence of cerebral vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were consecutively enrolled between October 2015 to July 2019. We employed carotid duplex sonography to measure the internal jugular vein (IJV). The subjects were classified into two groups based on the degree of JVR on either side: none, mild (JVR(-) group) and moderate, severe (JVR (+) group) JVR. They underwent both the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Japanese (MoCA-J) global tests. Their cognitive status was prospectively assessed until March 2023. 302 patients with an MMSE score \u226524 underwent duplex sonography of the IJV. Among them, 91 had spontaneous JVR on either side. Both MMSE and MoCA-J were significantly lower in patients with JVR (+) group than in the JVR (-) group. After the adjustment for risk factors and MRI findings, intergroup differences in MoCA-J remained significant. Among the cognitive subdomains, median executive function and memory scores were significantly lower in the JVR (+) group than in the JVR (-) group. During the median 5.2-year follow-up, 11 patients with incident dementia were diagnosed. Patients with severe JVR were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with dementia (log-rank test, p\u200a=\u200a0.031).

        "AbstractText": "The approval of lecanemab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States has sparked controversy over issues of safety, cost, and efficacy. Furthermore, the prognostication of cognitive decline is prohibitively difficult with current methods. The inability to forecast incipient dementia in patients with biological AD suggests a prophylactic scenario wherein all patients with cognitive decline are prescribed anti-AD drugs at the earliest manifestations of dementia; however, most patients with mild cognitive impairment (approximately 77.7% ) do not develop dementia over a 3-year period. Prophylactic response therefore constitutes unethical, costly, and unnecessary treatment for these patients. We present a snapshot of the costs associated with the first 3 years of mass availability of anti-AD drugs in a variety of scenarios. We consider multiple prognostication scenarios with varying sensitivities and specificities based on neuroimaging studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment to determine approximate costs for the large-scale use of lecanemab. The combination of fluorodeoxyglucose and magnetic resonance was determined to be the most cost-efficient at $177,000 for every positive outcome every 3 years under an assumed adjustment in the price of lecanemab to $9,275 per year. Imaging-assisted identification of cognitive status in patients with prodromal AD is demonstrated to reduce costs and prevent instances of unnecessary treatment in all cases considered. This highlights the potential of this technology for the ethical prescription of anti-AD medications under a paradigm of imaging-assisted early detection for pharmaceutical intervention in the treatment of AD.",

PM2.5 exposure was associated with altered amino acid metabolism, energy production, and oxidative stress response, pathways also associated with Alzheimer's disease. Three metabolites were associated with PM2.5 exposure through all three approaches: cysteinylglycine disulfide, a diglyceride, and a dicarboxylic acid. The relationship between several features and PM2.5 exposure was modified by diet and metabolic diseases.

With the increase in aged population, there is a prevalence of irreversible neurodegenerative changes, causing a significant mental, social, and economic burden globally. The factors contributing to AD are multidimensional, highly complex, and not completely understood. However, it is widely known that aging, neuroinflammation, and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with other free radicals, substantially contribute to oxidative stress and cell death, which are inextricably linked. While oxidative stress is undeniably important in AD, limiting free radicals and ROS levels is an intriguing and potential strategy for deferring the process of neurodegeneration and alleviating associated symptoms. Therapeutic compounds from natural sources have recently become increasingly accepted and have been effectively studied for AD treatment. These phytocompounds are widely available and a multitude of holistic therapeutic efficiencies for treating AD owing to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and biological activities. Some of these compounds also function by stimulating cholinergic neurotransmission, facilitating the suppression of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1, \u03b1-synuclein, and monoamine oxidase proteins, and deterring the occurrence of AD. Additionally, various phenolic, flavonoid, and terpenoid phytocompounds have been extensively described as potential palliative agents for AD progression.

PRKN is located in FRA6E, which is one of the common fragile sites in the human genome, making this region prone to structural variants. However, complex structural variants such as inversions of PRKN are seldom reported, suggesting that there are potentially unrevealed complex pathogenic PRKN structural variants. To identify complex structural variants in PRKN using long-read sequencing. We investigated the genetic cause of monozygotic twins presenting with a young onset dystonia-parkinsonism using targeted sequencing, whole exome sequencing, multiple ligation probe amplification, and long-read sequencing. We assessed the presence and frequency of complex inversions overlapping PRKN using whole-genome sequencing data of Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinson's disease (AMP-PD) and United Kingdom (UK)-Biobank datasets. Multiple ligation probe amplification identified a heterozygous exon three deletion in PRKN and long-read sequencing identified a large novel inversion spanning over 7\u2009Mb, including a large part of the coding DNA sequence of PRKN. We could diagnose the affected subjects as compound heterozygous carriers of PRKN. We analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 43,538 participants of the UK-Biobank and 4941 participants of the AMP-PD datasets. Nine inversions in the UK-Biobank and two in AMP PD were identified and were considered potentially damaging and likely to affect PRKN expression. This is the first report describing a large 7\u2009Mb inversion involving breakpoints outside of PRKN.

        "AbstractText": "We have proposed that cognitive resilience (CR) counteracts brain damage from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related dementias such that older individuals who harbor neurodegenerative disease burden sufficient to cause dementia remain cognitively normal. However, CR traditionally is considered a binary trait, capturing only the most extreme examples, and is often inconsistently defined. This study addressed existing discrepancies and shortcomings of the current CR definition by proposing a framework for defining CR as a continuous variable for each neuropsychological test. The linear equations clarified CR's relationship to closely related terms, including cognitive function, reserve, compensation, and damage. Primarily, resilience is defined as a function of cognitive performance and damage from neuropathologic damage. As such, the study utilized data from 844 individuals (age\u2009=\u200979\u2009\u00b1\u200912, 44% female) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center cohort that met our inclusion criteria of comprehensive lesion rankings for 17 neuropathologic features and complete neuropsychological test results. Machine learning models and GWAS then were used to identify medical and genetic factors that are associated with CR. CR varied across five cognitive assessments and was greater in female participants, associated with longer survival, and weakly associated with educational attainment or APOE \u03b54 allele. In contrast, damage was strongly associated with APOE \u03b54 allele (P value\u2009<\u20090.0001). Major predictors of CR were cardiovascular health and social interactions, as well as the absence of behavioral symptoms. Our framework explicitly decoupled the effects of CR from neuropathologic damage. Characterizations and genetic association study of these two components suggest that the underlying CR mechanism has minimal overlap with the disease mechanism. Moreover, the identified medical features associated with CR suggest modifiable features to counteract clinical expression of damage and maintain cognitive function in older individuals.",

Data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) was utilized to conduct this study. CHAP is a population-based cohort study of chronic conditions in older adults. Participants completed in-home interviews cycles of three years from 1993-2012. Mixed effects regression models were conducted to test the associations between physical activity, neuroticism, and the interaction between neuroticism and physical activity on outcomes: global cognitive function, global cognitive decline, episodic memory, decline in episodic memory, perceptual speed, and decline in perceptual speed. Stratified mixed effects regression models by physical activity level were conducted to test the associations between neuroticism and global cognitive function and global cognitive decline. A total of 7,685 participants were eligible for this study. Participants were 62% female and 64% African American. We found statistically significant associations for the interaction of high physical activity and neuroticism on baseline global cognitive function (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.017 (SE\u2009=\u20090.007), p\u2009=\u2009.010) and on the interaction of neuroticism and high physical activity on baseline episodic memory (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.020 (SE\u2009=\u2009.009), p\u2009=\u2009.021) and on decline in episodic memory over time (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.003 (SE\u2009=\u2009.001), p\u2009=\u2009.039).

        "AbstractText": "Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has extended lifespans of people living with HIV (PWH), increasing both the risk for age-related neuropathologies and the importance of distinguishing effects of HIV and its comorbidities from neurodegenerative disorders. The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in hippocampus is a common degenerative change, with specific patterns of hippocampal subfield vulnerability observed in different disease contexts. Currently, associations between chronic HIV, its comorbidities, and p-tau burden and distribution in the hippocampus are unexplored. We used immunohistochemistry with antibody AT8 to analyze hippocampal p-tau in brain tissues of PWH (n\u2009=\u200971) and HIV negative controls (n\u2009=\u200925), for whom comprehensive clinical data were available. Using a morphology-based neuroanatomical segmentation protocol, we annotated digital slide images to measure percentage p-tau areas in the hippocampus and its subfields. Factors predicting p-tau burden and distribution were identified in univariate analyses, and those with significance at p\u2009\u2264\u20090.100 were advanced to multivariable regression. The patient sample had a mean age of 61.5\u00a0years. Age predicted overall hippocampal p-tau burden. Subfield p-tau predictors were for Cornu Ammonis (CA)1, age; for CA2 and subiculum, seizure history; for CA3, seizure history and head trauma; and for CA4/dentate, history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In this autopsy sample, hippocampal p-tau burden and distribution were not predicted by HIV, viral load, or immunologic status, with viral effects limited to associations between HCV and CA4/dentate vulnerability. Hippocampal p-tau pathologies in cART-era PWH appear to reflect age and comorbidities, but not direct effects of HIV infection.",

This study aimed to detect the joint and interactive associations of socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle factors with incident dementia risk, and the underlying brain imaging alterations.

A total of 276,730 participants with a mean age of 55.9 (\u00b18.0) years old from UK biobank were included. Over 8.5 (\u00b12.6) years of follow-up, 3013 participants were diagnosed with dementia. Participants with high SES and most healthy lifestyle had a significantly lower risk of incident dementia (HR=0.19, 95% CI=0.14 to 0.26, P<2\u00d710-16), Alzheimer's disease (AD, HR=0.19, 95% CI=0.13 to 0.29, P=8.94\u00d710-15), and vascular dementia (HR=0.24, 95% CI=0.12 to 0.48, P=7.57\u00d710-05) compared with participants with low SES and an unhealthy lifestyle. Significant interactions were found between SES and lifestyle on dementia (P=0.002) and AD (P=0.001) risks; the association between lifestyle and dementia was stronger among those of high SES. The combination of high SES and healthy lifestyle was positively associated with higher volumes in brain regions vulnerable to dementia-related atrophy. These findings suggest that SES and lifestyle significantly interact and influence dementia with its related brain structure phenotypes.",

        "AbstractText": "Disruptions to iron metabolism and iron\u00a0homeostasis have emerged as significant contributors to the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human transferrin plays a key part in maintaining iron equilibrium throughout the body, highlighting its importance in AD. Many plant-derived compounds and dietary constituents show promise for preventing AD. Polyphenols that are\u00a0abundant in fruits, vegetables, teas, coffee, and herbs possess neuroprotective attributes. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol present in various plant sources like grapes, berries, peanuts, and red wine that has garnered research interest due to its wide range of biological activities. Notably, resveratrol exhibits neuroprotective effects that may help prevent or treat AD through multiple mechanisms. In the present study, we employed a combination of molecular docking and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (MD) along with experimental approaches to unravel the intricate interactions between transferrin and resveratrol deciphering the binding mechanism. Through molecular docking analysis, it was determined that resveratrol occupies the iron\u00a0binding pocket of transferrin. Furthermore, MD simulations provided a more profound insight into the stability and conformational dynamics of the complex suggesting that the binding of resveratrol introduced localized flexibility, while maintaining overall stability. The spectroscopic observations yielded clear evidence of substantial binding between resveratrol and transferrin, confirming the computational findings. The identified binding mechanism and conformational stability hold potential for advancing the development of innovative therapeutic approaches targeting AD through resveratrol, particularly concerning iron homeostasis. These insights serve as a platform for considering the natural compounds in the realm of AD therapeutics.",

Using survival models, we assessed the effect of advanced BA on incident neurological diagnoses, including all-cause and cause-specific dementia, ischaemic stroke, Parkinson's disease and motor neuron disease. During a mean follow-up of 9.0 years, there were 1397 incident cases of dementia and 2515 of ischaemic stroke, with smaller case numbers of other diagnoses. The strongest associations with a 1 SD in BA residual were seen for all-cause dementia (KDMAge HR=1.19, 95% CI=1.11 to 1.26), vascular dementia (1.41, 1.25 to 1.60) and ischaemic stroke (1.39, 1.34 to 1.46).

We developed a deep learning frame work explainable variational autoencoder (E-VAE) classifier model using genotype (GWAS SNPs=5474) data from 2714 study participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to classify ADRD. We validated the generalizability of this model among 234 participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Utilizing a linear decoder approach we have extracted the weights associated with latent features for biological interpretation.

However, the role of Rlip in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases is not well understood. The purpose of the present study is to determine the role of Rlip in the brains of AD patients and control subjects. To achieve our goals, we used frozen tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded postmortem brains from AD patients of different Braak stages and age-matched control subjects. Our immunohistology and immunoblotting blotting analysis revealed that expression of Rlip protein gradually and significantly decreased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) with AD progression, being lowest in Braak stage IV-V. Rlip was colocalized with Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) as observed by IHC staining and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Lipid peroxidation (4-HNE generation) and H2O2 production were significantly higher (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004 and 0.0001 respectively) in AD patients compared to controls, and this was accompanied by lower ATP production in AD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0009). Oxidative DNA damage was measured by 8-Hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in tissue lysates by ELISA and COMET assay. AD 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) compared to controls. COMET assay was performed in brain cells, isolated from frozen postmortem samples. The control samples showed minimal DNA in comets representing few DNA strand breaks (<20\u00a0%), (score-0-1). However, the AD group showed an average of 50\u00a0% to 65\u00a0% of DNA in comet tails (score-4-5) indicating numerous DNA strand breaks. The difference between the two groups was significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), as analyzed by Open Comet by ImageJ. Elevated DNA damage was further examined by western blot analysis for phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (\u03b3H2AX). Induction of \u03b3H2AX was very significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and confirmed the presence of double-strand breaks in DNA. Overall, our results indicate an important role for Rlip in maintaining neuronal health and homeostasis by suppressing cellular oxidative stress and DNA damage.

However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Notably, TREM2 directly regulates microglia inflammation through various signaling pathways. Additionally, studies have suggested that TREM2 mediates microglial phagocytosis, autophagy, metabolism, and microglia phenotypes, which may be involved in the modulation of neuroinflammation.

We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these TMS indices among patients with NAD and healthy controls. Our meta-analyses indicated that TMS neurophysiological examinations revealed decreased glutamatergic function in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and decreased GABAergic function in patients with FTD, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease, cortico-basal syndrome, and multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the MRI and clinical data of 121 MCI patients, of whom 32 progressed to AD during a four-year follow-up period. The MCI patients were divided into training and validation sets at a ratio of 7:3. DTI features were extracted from MCI patient data in the training set, and their dimensionality was reduced to construct a radiomics signature (RS). Then, combining the RS with independent predictors of MCI disease progression, a joint model was constructed, and a nomogram was generated. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the diagnostic and clinical efficacy of the nomogram based on the data from the validation set. The AUCs of the RS in the training and validation sets were 0.81 and 0.84, with sensitivities of 0.87 and 0.78 and specificities of 0.71 and 0.81, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the RS, clinical dementia rating scale score, and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale score were the independent predictors of progression and thus used to construct the nomogram. The AUCs of the nomogram in the training and validation sets were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively, with sensitivities of 0.78 and 0.89 and specificities of 0.90 and 0.88, respectively.

Accumulation evidence suggests that low toxicity multi-target drugs may play effective roles in AD. Ginseng is the root and rhizome of Panax ginseng Meyer, which can be used not only as herbal medicine but also as a functional food to support body functions. Ginsenoside RK1 (RK1), obtained from ginseng plants through high-temperature treatment, has antiapoptotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects and these events are involved in the development of AD. So, we believe that RK1 may be an effective drug for the treatment of AD. We aimed to investigate the potential protective effects and mechanisms of RK1 in AD. Neuronal damage was detected by MTT assay, LDH assay, immunofluorescence and western blotting. Oxidative stress was measured by JC-1 staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) staining, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malonaldehyde (MDA). The cognitive deficit was measured through morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. RK1 attenuated A\u03b2-induced apoptosis, restored mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), and reduced intracellular levels of ROS in both PC12 cells and primary cultured neurons. In vivo, RK1 significantly improved cognitive deficits and mitigated AD-like pathological features. Notably, RK1 demonstrated superior efficacy compared to the positive control drug, donepezil. Mechanistically, our study elucidates that RK1 modulates the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream target, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), leading to the optimization of mitochondrial membrane potential, reduction of ROS levels, and mitigation of AD-like pathology. It's noteworthy that blocking the AMPK signaling pathway attenuated the protective effects of RK1. RK1 demonstrates superior efficacy in alleviating cognitive deficits and mitigating pathological changes compared to donepezil. These findings suggest the potential utility of RK1-based therapies in the development of treatments for AD.",

In addition, the results of some methods lack interpretability. In this work, we proposed a novel method (called DANMLP) of joining dual attention convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for computer-aided AD diagnosis by integrating multi-modality data of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical data (i.e., demographics, neuropsychology), and APOE genetic data. Our DANMLP consists of four primary components: (1) the Patch-CNN for extracting the image characteristics from each local patch, (2) the position self-attention block for capturing the dependencies between features within a patch, (3) the channel self-attention block for capturing dependencies of inter-patch features, (4) two MLP networks for extracting the clinical features and outputting the AD classification results, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the 5CV test, DANMLP achieves 93% and 82.4% classification accuracy for the AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC tasks on the ADNI database, which is 0.2%\u223c15.2% and 3.4%\u223c26.8% higher than that of other five methods, respectively. The individualized visualization of focal areas can also help clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD. These results indicate that DANMLP can be effectively used for diagnosing AD and MCI patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), have the gradual onset of neurobiological changes preceding clinical diagnosis by decades. To elucidate how brain dysfunction proceeds in neurodegenerative disorders, we performed longitudinal characterization of behavioral, morphological, and transcriptomic changes in a tauopathy mouse model, P301S transgenic mice. P301S mice exhibited cognitive deficits as early as 3 months old, and deficits in social preference and social cognition at 5-6 months. They had a significant decrease of arborization in basal dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons from 3 months and apical dendrites of PFC pyramidal neurons at 9 months. Transcriptomic analysis of genome-wide changes revealed the enrichment of synaptic gene upregulation at 3 months of age, while most of these synaptic genes were downregulated in PFC and hippocampus of P301S mice at 9 months. These time-dependent changes in gene expression may lead to progressive alterations of neuronal structure and function, resulting in the manifestation of behavioral symptoms in tauopathies.",

        "AbstractText": "Traditional and scientific evidence attribute numerous bioactivities of Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn.) in aging-related disorders. In this state-of-art review, an extensive search in several databases was conducted to collect all relevant literature and comprehensively analyze Licorice's pharmacological attributes, neuroprotective properties, safety, and its mechanistic role in treating various neurological conditions. Network pharmacology was employed for the first time exploring the mechanistic role of Licorice in neurological disorders. Its neuroprotective role is attributed to phytoconstituents, including liquiritin, glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritigenin, glabridin, 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid, quercetin, isoliquiritigenin, paratocarpin B, glycyglabrone, and hispaglabridin B, as evident from in vitro and in vivo studies. Network pharmacology analysis reveals that these compounds protect against long-term depression, aging-associated diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and other addictions through interactions with cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic proteins, validated in animal studies only. Future clinical trials are warranted as Licorice administration has a limiting factor of mild hypertension and hypokalemia. Hopefully, scientific updates on Licorice will propagate a paradigm shift in medicine, research propagation, and development of the central nervous system phytopharmaceuticals.",

However, the therapeutic mechanism of JSW in the treatment of AD remains unclear. This study aimed to verify the pharmacodynamics of JSW in the treatment of AD, and to explore its potential mechanism based on network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental validation both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the underlying mechanism of JSW against AD was investigated by the integration of network pharmacology. Then, the core pathways and biological process of JSW were verified by experiment, including behavioral test and pathological and biochemical assays with 6-month-old APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 transgenic (APP/PS1) mice in vivo and verified with A\u03b21-42-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. At last, molecular docking was used to show the binding activity of each active ingredient to the core genes of JSW treatment in AD. A Drug-Ingredient-Target network was established, which included 363 ingredients and 116 targets related to the JSW treatment of AD. The main metabolic pathway of JSW treatment for AD is neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, and biological processes are mainly involved in A\u03b2 metabolic process. In vivo experiments, compared with APP/PS1 mice, the cognitive and memory ability of mice was significantly improved after JSW administration. In brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice, JSW could increase the contents of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), enkephalinase (NEP) and Acetyl choline (ACh), and decrease the contents of A\u03b21-42, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), decrease the vitality of cholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Besides, JSW could increase \u03b1-secretase expression and decrease \u03b2/\u03b3-secretase expression, and improve the number and morphology of synapses in CA1 region of the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In vitro experiments, Drug-Containing Serum (JSW-serum) has a neuroprotective effect by reducing the apoptosis on A\u03b21-42-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Molecular docking results showed that 2-Isopropyl-8-methylphenanthrene-3,4-dione had strong binding activity with PTGS2, which maybe a potential ingredient for the treatment of AD. JSW improves AD in APP/PS1 mice, and this therapeutic effect may be achieved in part by altering the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway.",

Reported pharmacological properties include antioxidant effects, enhanced learning and memory, and protection against ischemic neuronal cell death, supporting its use in treating neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aims to assess the effects of co-treatment with WCW and donepezil on cognitive functions and serum metabolic profiles in a scopolamine-induced AD model. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured in amyloid \u03b2-peptide25-35 (A\u03b225-35)-induced SH-SY5Y cells. An AD model was established in ICR mice by intraperitoneal scopolamine administration. Animals underwent the step-through passive avoidance test (PAT) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Hippocampal tissues were collected to examine specific protein expression. Serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Co-treatment with WCW and donepezil increased cell viability and reduced ROS production in A\u03b225-35-induced SH-SY5Y cells compared to that with donepezil treatment alone. Co-treatment improved cognitive functions and was comparable to donepezil treatment alone in the PAT and MWM tests. Pathways related to tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and cysteine and methionine metabolism were altered by co-treatment. Levels of tyrosine and methionine, major serum metabolites in these pathways, were significantly reduced after co-treatment. Co-treatment with WCW and donepezil shows promise as a therapeutic strategy for AD and is comparable to donepezil alone in improving cognitive function. Reduced tyrosine and methionine levels after co-treatment may enhance cognitive function by mitigating hypertyrosinemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, known risk factors for AD. The serum metabolic profiles obtained in this study can serve as a foundation for developing other bioactive compounds using a scopolamine-induced mouse model.",

        "AbstractText": "Schizophrenia is associated with increased risk of developing multiple aging-related diseases, including metabolic, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's and related dementias, leading to the hypothesis that schizophrenia is accompanied by accelerated biological aging. This has been difficult to test because there is no widely accepted measure of biological aging. Epigenetic clocks are promising algorithms that are used to calculate biological age on the basis of information from combined cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) across the genome, but they have yielded inconsistent and often negative results about the association between schizophrenia and accelerated aging. Here we test the schizophrenia-aging hypothesis using a DNA methylation measure that is uniquely designed to predict an individual's rate of aging. We brought together 5 case-control datasets to calculate DunedinPACE (Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome), a new measure trained on longitudinal data to detect differences between people in their pace of aging over time. Data were available from 1812 psychosis cases (schizophrenia or first-episode psychosis) and 1753 controls. Mean chronological age was 38.9 (SD=13.6) years. We observed consistent associations across datasets between schizophrenia and accelerated aging as measured by DunedinPACE. These associations were not attributable to tobacco smoking or clozapine medication. Schizophrenia is accompanied by accelerated biological aging, already by midlilfe. This may explain schizophrenia's wide-ranging risk for developing multiple different age-related physical diseases: metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascular, dementia. Measures of biological aging could prove valuable for assessing patients' risk for physical and cognitive decline and for evaluating intervention effectiveness.",

        "AbstractText": "The self-aggregation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau proteins are closely implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence indicates that A\u03b2 and tau proteins can cross-interact to form co-aggregates, which aggravates the development of AD. However, their transient heterooligomer conformations and co-aggregation molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Herein, we utilize replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the conformational ensembles formed by the central hydrophobic core of A\u03b2 (A\u03b216-22) and each of two fibril-nucleating core segments of tau (PHF6* and PHF6). Both PHF6 and PHF6* are found to co-aggregate with A\u03b216-22 into \u03b2-sheet-rich heterooligomers. Intriguingly, PHF6 and A\u03b216-22 peptides formed closed \u03b2-barrels, while PHF6* and A\u03b216-22 formed open \u03b2-barrels, implying their distinct co-aggregation property. Compared to A\u03b216-22-PHF6*, A\u03b216-22-PHF6 heterooligomers have higher \u03b2-sheet content, and contain longer \u03b2-strands and larger \u03b2-sheets, indicative of stronger co-aggregation ability of PHF6 with A\u03b216-22. Further analyses reveal that hydrophobic and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between Y310 of PHF6 and A\u03b216-22 are crucial for the closed \u03b2-barrel/larger \u03b2-sheet formation in A\u03b216-22-PHF6 heterooligomers. These results highlight the paramount importance of PHF6 fragment, particularly Y310 residue, as a potential target for inhibiting A\u03b2-tau co-aggregation, which could help for effective therapeutic design in mitigating A\u03b2-tau co-aggregation related amyloidogenesis.",

There is great potential for natural products to be used in the development of anti-AD drugs. P-coumaric acid (PCA), a small molecule phenolic acid widely distributed in the plant kingdom, has pharmacological effects such as neuroprotection, but its anti-AD mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism of PCA intervention in the A\u03b225-35-induced AD model using gut microbiomics and serum metabolomics combined with in vitro and in vivo pharmacological experiments. PCA was found to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction and neuronal cell damage in A\u03b225-35-injected mice as measured by behavioral, pathological and biochemical indicators. 16S rDNA sequencing and serum metabolomics showed that PCA reduced the abundance of pro-inflammatory-associated microbiota (morganella, holdemanella, fusicatenibacter and serratia) in the gut, which were closely associated with metabolites of the glucose metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, tyrosine metabolism and phospholipid metabolism pathways in serum. Next, in vivo and in vitro pharmacological investigations revealed that PCA regulated A\u03b225-35-induced disruption of glucose metabolism through activation of PI3K/AKT/Glut1 signaling. Additionally, PCA ameliorated A\u03b225-35-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and by modulating upstream MAPK signaling. In conclusion, PCA ameliorated cognitive deficits in A\u03b225-35-induced AD mice by regulating glucose metabolism and neuroinflammation, and the mechanism is related not only to restoring homeostasis of gut microbiota and serum metabolites, but also to PI3K/AKT/Glut1 and MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling.",

Long-term, well-powered efficacy trials are required to understand whether CPAP could slow cognitive decline in individuals with MCI/AD, but its tolerability in this group remains uncertain. The present review investigates CPAP adherence among individuals with OSA and MCI/AD. Electronic searches were performed on 8 databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Six independent studies and four secondary analyses included 278 unique participants (mean age\u00a0=\u00a072.1 years). In five of the retained studies, around half of participants (45% N\u00a0=\u00a085 MCI, 56% N\u00a0=\u00a022 AD) were adherent to CPAP, where \u22654\u00a0h use per night was considered adherent. Three of the retained studies also reported average CPAP use to range between 3.2 and 6.3\u00a0h/night. CPAP adherence in individuals with MCI and AD is low, albeit similar to the general elderly population. Reporting adherence in future studies as both average duration as well as using a binary cut-off would improve our understanding of the optimum CPAP use in dementia clinical trials and care.",

CES-D scores were analyzed in growth-mixture models to determine depression trajectories from baseline (post-surgery, pre-systemic therapy) through 3-year annual follow-up. Multivariable, multinomial logistic regression was used to identify baseline predictors of depression trajectories. Survivors had three distinct trajectories: stable (84.6%), emerging depressive symptoms (10.3%), and recovery from high depressive symptoms at baseline that improved slowly over time (5.1%). Compared to stable survivors, those in the emerging (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.08-1.23) or recovery (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.15-1.38) groups reported greater baseline anxiety.

        "AbstractText": "Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), also known as aspirin, was discovered in 1897 as an acetylated form of salicylate. It has been widely used for its anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects. It is commonly used for its cardiovascular benefits and is prescribed as secondary prophylaxis after a heart attack. Furthermore, low-dose, long-term ASA is used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in individuals without prior cardiovascular disease. Acetylsalicylic acid acts as a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX), which inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins and prevents pro-inflammatory cytokines. Findings suggest that targeting cytokines and growth factors could be a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing neuroinflammation and slowing down the progression of dementia. Additionally, prostaglandins contribute to synaptic plasticity and can act as retrograde messengers in synapses. Research has implicated COX-1, one of the isoforms of the enzyme, in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders. The inhibition of COX-1 might potentially prevent impairments in working memory and reduce neuroinflammation caused by beta-amyloid proteins in some conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cyclooxygenase-2, an inducible form of the enzyme, is expressed in cortical and hippocampal neurons and is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. The inhibition or knockout of COX-2 has been shown to decrease long-term potentiation, a process involved in memory formation. Studies have also demonstrated that the administration of COX-2 inhibitors impairs cognitive function and memory acquisition and recall in animal models. There remains a debate regarding the effects of aspirin on dementia and cognitive decline. Although some studies suggest a possible protective effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, against the development of AD, others have shown inconsistent evidence. This review provides an overview of the effects of ASA or its active metabolite salicylate on learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity.",

Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, has been associated with mutations in TREM2, which is also responsible for raising the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we have made an endeavour to differentiate the confirmed pathogenic variants in TREM2 extra-cellular domain (ECD) linked with NHD and AD using mutation-induced fold stability change (\u2206\u2206G), with the computation of 12distinct structure-based methods through saturation mutagenesis. Correlation analysis between relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and \u2206\u2206G expresses the discrete distributive behaviour of mutants associated with TREM2 in AD (R2\u2009=\u20090.061) and NHD (R2\u2009=\u20090.601). Our findings put an emphasis on W50 and V126 as major players in maintaining V-like domain in TREM2. Interestingly, we discern that both of them interact with a common residue Y108, which is dissolved upon mutation. This Y108 could have structural or functional role for TREM2 which can be an ideal candidate for further study. Furthermore, the residual interaction network highlights the importance of R47 and R62 in maintaining the CDR loops that are crucial for ligand binding. Future studies using biophysical characterisation of ligand interactions in TREM2-ECD would be helpful for the development of novel therapeutics for AD and NHD. ConSurf algorithm and ENDscript were used to determine the position and conservation of each residue in the wild-type ECD of TREM2. The mutation-induced fold stability change (\u2206\u2206G) of confirmed pathogenic mutants associated with NHD and AD was estimated using 12 state-of-the-art structure-based protein stability tools. Furthermore, we also computed the effect of random mutation on these sites using computational saturation mutagenesis. Linear regression analysis was performed using mutants \u2206\u2206G and RSA through GraphPad software.

While EOAD exhibits the same clinicopathological changes such as amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), brain atrophy, and cognitive decline (Sirkis et al. in Mol Psychiatry 27:2674-88, 2022; Caldwell et al. in Mol Brain 15:83, 2022) as observed in the more prevalent late-onset AD (LOAD), EOAD patients tend to have more severe cognitive deficits, including visuospatial, language, and executive dysfunction (Sirkis et al. in Mol Psychiatry 27:2674-88, 2022). Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been used to model and study penetrative, familial AD (FAD) mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 (Valdes et al. in Research Square 1-30, 2022; Caldwell et al. in Sci Adv 6:1-16, 2020) but have been seldom used for sporadic forms of AD that display more heterogeneous disease mechanisms. In this study, we sought to characterize iPSC-derived neurons from EOAD patients via RNA sequencing. A modest difference in expression profiles between EOAD patients and non-demented control (NDC) subjects resulted in a limited number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

One hundred forty-four elderly participants underwent 18F-AV45 positron emission tomography (PET) scan, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and blood sample collection. The composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was derived from 18F-AV45 PET to assess brain amyloid burden, and the hippocampal volume was determined from structural MRI scans. Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated tau-181 (ptau-181), and neurofilament light (NfL) measured by single molecular array (SIMOA) technology were assessed with respect to ATN framework, genetic risk factor, age, clinical assessment, and future functional decline among the participants. Among the three plasma markers, GFAP best discriminated participants stratified by clinical diagnosis and brain amyloid status. Age was strongly associated with NfL, followed by GFAP and ptau-181 at much weaker extent. Brain amyloid was strongly associated with plasma GFAP and ptau-181 and to a lesser extent with plasma NfL. Moderate association was observed between plasma markers. Hippocampal volume was weakly associated with all three markers. Elevated GFAP and ptau-181 were associated with worse cognition, and plasma GFAP was the most predictive of future functional decline. Combining GFAP and ptau-181 together was the best model to predict brain amyloid status across all participants (AUC\u2009=\u20090.86) or within cognitively impaired participants (AUC\u2009=\u20090.93); adding NfL as an additional predictor only had a marginal improvement. Our findings indicate that GFAP is of potential clinical utility in screening amyloid pathology and predicting future cognitive decline. GFAP, NfL, and ptau-181 were moderately associated with each other, with discrepant relevance to age, sex, and AD genetic risk, suggesting their relevant but differential roles for AD assessment. The combination of GFAP with ptau-181 provides an accurate model to predict brain amyloid status, with the superior performance of GFAP over ptau-181 when the prediction is limited to cognitively impaired participants.",

        "AbstractText": "The use of mixed effect models with a specific functional form such as the Sigmoidal Mixed Model and the Piecewise Mixed Model (or Changepoint Mixed Model) with abrupt or smooth random change allows the interpretation of the defined parameters to understand longitudinal trajectories. Currently, there are no interface R packages that can easily fit the Sigmoidal Mixed Model allowing the inclusion of covariates or incorporating recent developments to fit the Piecewise Mixed Model with random change. To facilitate the modeling of the Sigmoidal Mixed Model, and Piecewise Mixed Model with abrupt or smooth random change, we have created an R package called nlive. All needed pieces such as functions, covariance matrices, and initials generation were programmed. The package was implemented with recent developments such as the polynomial smooth transition of the piecewise mixed model with improved properties over Bacon-Watts, and the stochastic approximation expectation-maximization (SAEM) for efficient estimation. It was designed to help interpretation of the output by providing features such as annotated output, warnings, and graphs. Functionality, including time and convergence, was tested using simulations. We provided a data example to illustrate the package use and output features and interpretation. The package implemented in the R software is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlive . The nlive package for R fits the Sigmoidal Mixed Model and the Piecewise Mixed: abrupt and smooth. The nlive allows fitting these models with only five mandatory arguments that are intuitive enough to the less sophisticated users.",

        "AbstractText": "Protein misfolding and aggregation play crucial roles in amyloidogenic diseases through the self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in type II diabetes (T2D), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder after AD, and is associated with the loss of dopaminergic signaling, which causes motor and nonmotor signs and symptoms. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are common pathological hallmarks of PD that are mainly composed of aggregates of disordered \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn). There have been many efforts to develop chemical compounds to prevent aggregation or facilitate disruption of the aggregates. Furthermore, the roles and interactions of many compounds have yet to be revealed at the atomistic level, especially their impacts on the dynamics and chain-chain interactions of the oligomers, which are of interest in this study. The conformational diversity and detailed interactions among homo-oligomer chains of \u03b1-Syn are not fully discovered; identifying these might help uncover a practical approach to developing a potent therapy. In this study, we used an in-silico investigation to address the conformational diversity of \u03b1-Syn oligomer. The roles of several point mutations in protein aggregation in PD are known; we take this further by evaluating the interaction energies and contributions of all residues in stability and residue-chain interactions. In this study, we docked chemical derivatives of three compounds with high drug-likeness properties to evaluate the roles of our ligands in the conformational dynamicity of the oligomers, with emphasis on intramolecular forces. Free energy evaluation of the modeled inter and intramolecular interactions through MD simulation shows effective interaction and binding between \u03b1-Syn and our compounds. However, we find that they do not significantly disrupt the chain-chain interactions, compared to unliganded simulation.",

The meta-SNP tool includes four different integrated tools (SIFT, PANTHER, SNAP, and PhD-SNP) was used to identify non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNPs). Prediction of nsSNPs was conducted on three representative proteins for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases; APPl in Drosophila melanogaster, LRRK1 in Aedes aegypti, and VCPl in Tribolium castaneum. With the possibility of using insect models to investigate neurodegenerative diseases. We conclude from the protein comparative analysis between different insect models and nsSNP analyses that D. melanogaster is the best model for Alzheimer's representing five nsSNPs of the 21 suggested mutations in the APPl protein. Aedes aegypti is the best model for Parkinson's representing three nsSNPs in the LRRK1 protein.

We also identify distinct subtypes of border-associated macrophages (BAMs) that display differential gene expressions from microglia and express risk genes for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as nominated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We discover cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes in individuals with Alzheimer's dementia, particularly in fibroblasts and BAMs. Indeed, when cultured, leptomeningeal cells display the signature of ex vivo AD fibroblasts upon amyloid-\u03b2 treatment.

In this study, we constructed frequency-based multilayer resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) networks and extracted representative network features to improve the differentiation between AD and FTD. When compared with healthy controls (HC), AD showed primarily stronger delta-alpha cross-couplings and weaker theta-sigma cross-couplings. Notably, when comparing the AD and FTD groups, we found that the AD exhibited stronger delta-alpha and delta-beta connectivity than the FTD. Thereafter, by extracting the representative network features and then applying these features in the classification between AD and FTD, an accuracy of 81.1% was achieved. Finally, a multivariable linear regressive model was built, based on the differential topologies, and then adopted to predict the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale. Accordingly, the predicted and actual measured scores were indeed significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.274, p = 0.036).

Protein-aggregate deposition is a hallmark of aging and neurodegeneration. Our previous study reported that aggregation is strikingly elevated in hearts of hypertensive and aged mice; however, no prior study has addressed MI effects on aggregation in heart or brain. Here, we present novel data on heart and brain aggregation in mice following experimental MI, induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation. Infarcted and peri-infarcted heart tissue, and whole cerebra, were isolated from mice at sacrifice, 7 days following LCA ligation. Sham-MI mice (identical surgery without ligation) served as controls. We purified detergent-insoluble aggregates from these tissues, and quantified key protein constituents by high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Infarct heart tissue had 2.5- to 10-fold more aggregates than non-infarct or sham-MI heart tissue (each P\u2009=\u20090.001). Protein constituents from MI cerebral aggregates overlapped substantially with those from human Alzheimer's disease brain. Prior injection of mice with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) exosomes, shown to limit infarct size after LCA ligation, reduced cardiac aggregation\u2009~\u200960%, and attenuated markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in heart and brain (GRP78, ATF6, P-PERK) by 50-75%. MI also elevated aggregate constituents enriched in Alzheimer's disease (AD) aggregates, such as proteasomal subunits, heat-shock proteins, complement C3, clusterin/ApoJ, and other apolipoproteins. These data provide novel evidence that aggregation is elevated in mouse hearts and brains after myocardial ischemia, leading to cognitive impairment resembling AD, but can be attenuated by exosomes or drug (CDN1163) interventions that oppose ER stress.",

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated signaling cascade is currently identified as a crucial pro-inflammatory pathway that plays a significant role in the development of neuroinflammation. This process has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), CNS damage, and cerebral ischemia. Getting enough polyphenols through eating habits has resulted in mitigating the effects of oxidative stress (OS) and lowering the susceptibility to associated neurodegenerative disorders, including but not limited to multiple sclerosis (MS), AD, stroke, and PD. Polyphenols possess significant promise in dealing with the root cause of neurological conditions by modulating multiple therapeutic targets simultaneously, thereby attenuating their complicated physiology. Several polyphenolic substances have demonstrated beneficial results in various studies and are presently undergoing clinical investigation to treat neurological diseases (NDs). The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the different aspects of the MAPK pathway involved in neurological conditions, along with an appraisal of the progress made in using polyphenols to regulate the MAPK signaling system to facilitate the management of NDs.",

To elucidate the mechanisms of decreased [18F]-FDG uptake in the AD by PET, [18F]-FDG uptake in the brain of aged model mouse of AD was investigated using a dynamic autoradiography technique \"bioradiography\". A X-ray phase-contrast imaging (X-PCI) and a histopathological evaluation were also investigated to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationships between decreased [18F]-FDG uptake and the pathological changes in the brain of AD mouse. In this study, AD model mouse (5XFAD, APP+/PS1+) were used. [18F]-FDG-bioradiography was conducted in fresh slices of brain tissue under the condition of resting (slices immersed in 5\u00a0mM K+ solution) and metabolically active (in 50\u00a0mM K+ solution). Amyloid \u03b242 (A\u03b242) deposition in the brain of AD mouse was confirmed by X-PCI. In addition, the positive cells of phosphated tau protein (P-tau) and deposition of A\u03b242 were also examined by immunohistochemical staining. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the resting condition. In the activate condition of the brain, [18F]-FDG uptake was significantly decreased in AD mice compared to WT mice. In X-PCI showed A\u03b2 deposition in the AD mouse, but not in the WT. The AD mouse also showed increased P-tau, accumulation of A\u03b242, increase in neuronal apoptosis, and decrease in the number of neurons than that of the WT mouse. Neuronal damage, and induction of neuronal apoptosis, decreased [18F]-FDG uptake, increased A\u03b2 accumulation and P-tau induced neurofibrillary degeneration are observed in AD mouse. In clinical diagnosis, reduction of [18F]-FDG uptake by PET is one of the means of diagnosing the onset of AD.

In vivo, 5 \u03bcL of disease venom was injected into the lateral ventricle of APP/PS1 mice for treatment. Pyroptosis was induced by treating astrocytes with A\u03b242 in vitro. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to silence caspase-1 and Gasdermin D (GSDMD) mRNA expression. Cell viability was determined using a CCK-8 detection kit. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect cell pyroptosis. The degree of pathological damage to the brain and aortic tissue was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. A\u03b242 induced astrocyte pyroptosis dependent on the GSDMD/Gasdermin E (GSDME)/Caspase 11/NLRP3 pathway, releasing large amounts of inflammatory factors, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18. Astrocyte pyroptosis caused endothelial cell dysfunction and release of large amounts of vasoconstrictors (ET and vWF). Knockdown of GSDMD reduced astrocyte pyroptosis in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal tissue, decreased the release of inflammatory factors IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-18, reduced A\u03b2 deposition and tau protein, increased the release of peripheral vasodilator substances (eNOS), and decreased the release of vasoconstrictor substances (ET, vWF), thereby reducing brain tissue damage and vascular injury in APP/PS1 mice.

        "ArticleTitle": "Pathologic polyglutamine aggregation begins with a self-poisoning polymer crystal.",
        "AbstractText": "A long-standing goal of amyloid research has been to characterize the structural basis of the rate-determining nucleating event. However, the ephemeral nature of nucleation has made this goal unachievable with existing biochemistry, structural biology, and computational approaches. Here, we addressed that limitation for polyglutamine (polyQ), a polypeptide sequence that causes Huntington's and other amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases when its length exceeds a characteristic threshold. To identify essential features of the polyQ amyloid nucleus, we used a direct intracellular reporter of self-association to quantify frequencies of amyloid appearance as a function of concentration, conformational templates, and rational polyQ sequence permutations. We found that nucleation of pathologically expanded polyQ involves segments of three glutamine (Q) residues at every other position. We demonstrate using molecular simulations that this pattern encodes a four-stranded steric zipper with interdigitated Q side chains. Once formed, the zipper poisoned its own growth by engaging naive polypeptides on orthogonal faces, in a fashion characteristic of polymer crystals with intramolecular nuclei. We further show that self-poisoning can be exploited to block amyloid formation, by genetically oligomerizing polyQ prior to nucleation. By uncovering the physical nature of the rate-limiting event for polyQ aggregation in cells, our findings elucidate the molecular etiology of polyQ diseases. Diseases that typically occur later in life, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, are often caused by specific proteins clumping together into structures known as amyloids. Once the process starts, amyloids will continue to form, leading to worse symptoms that cannot be cured. The best way to treat these diseases is therefore to stop amyloids from arising in the first place. Amyloids initially develop by proteins coming together to create an unstable structure referred to as the nucleus. The instability of the nucleus means it cannot be observed directly, making it hard to study this nucleation process. To overcome this, Kandola, Venkatesan et al. investigated the simplest protein known to form an amyloid \u2013 polyglutamine, which is made up of a chain of repeating building blocks known as amino acids. Polyglutamine forms only one type of amyloid which is associated with nine neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington\u2019s disease. However, it only does this when its chain of amino acids exceeds a certain length, suggesting that a specific structure may be required for nucleation to begin. Kandola, Venkatesan et al. made alternative versions of the polyglutamine protein which each contained slightly different sequences of amino acids that will alter the way the protein folds. They then tested how well these different variants could form amyloids in yeast cells. This revealed that in order to join together into a nucleus, polyglutamine needs to be able to fold into a zipper shape made up of four interlocking strands. The length of the protein required to form this shape is also the same length that causes the amyloid associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Kandola, Venkatesan et al. also found that polyglutamine tends to bind to nuclei that have already formed in a way that hinders their growth. This \u2018self-poisoning\u2019 affect could potentially be exploited as a way to pre-emptively stop amyloids from initially arising. These findings have uncovered a potential therapeutic strategy for blocking amyloid formation that could eventually benefit people with or at risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases linked to polyglutamine. Additionally, this approach provides a blueprint for understanding how other proteins undergo amyloid nucleation, including those responsible for Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and other diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "This paper aims to establish a coupling model of neuronal populations and astrocytes and, on this basis, explore the possible mechanism of electroencephalography (EEG) slowing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the viewpoint of dynamical modeling. First and foremost, excitatory and inhibitory time constants are shown to induce the early symptoms of AD. The corresponding dynamic nature is mainly due to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the oscillatory behavior. However, there are also a few cases that can be attributed to the change of the oscillation mode caused by the limit cycle bifurcation and birhythmicity. Then, an improved neural mass model influenced by astrocytes is proposed, considering the important effects of glutamate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by astrocytes on the synaptic transmission process reported in experiments. The results show that a dysfunctional astrocyte disrupts the physiological state, causing three typical EEG slowing phenomena reported clinically: the decreased dominant frequency, the decreased rhythmic activity in the \u03b1 band, and the increased rhythmic activity in the \u03b4+\u03b8 band. In addition, astrocytes may control AD when the effect of ATP on synaptic connections is greater than that of glutamate. The control rate depends on the ratio of the effect of glutamate on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. These modeling results can not only reproduce some experimental and clinical results, but, more importantly, may offer a prediction of some underlying phenomena, helping to inspire the disease mechanisms and therapeutic methods of targeting astrocytes.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease where abnormal amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) occurs and has been linked to neuronal dysfunction. Hypometabolism of glucose in the brain can lead to synaptic loss and neuronal death, which in turn exacerbates energy deficiency and amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) accumulation. Lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis serves as an energy substrate supporting neuronal function and facilitating neuronal repair. Vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4) has been recognized as a key regulator of the hypoxia-sensing pathway. However, the role of VGLL4 in AD remains unexplored. Here, we reported that the expression of VGLL4 protein was significantly decreased in the brain tissue of AD model mice and AD model cells. We further found that overexpression of VGLL4 reduced APP amyloidogenic processing and ameliorated neuronal synaptic damage. Notably, we identified a compromised hypoxia-sensitive capability of LDHA regulated by VGLL4 in the context of AD. Upregulation of VGLL4 increased the response of LDHA to hypoxia and enhanced the expression levels of LDHA and lactate by inhibiting the ubiquitination and degradation of LDHA. Furthermore, the inhibition of lactate production by using sodium oxamate, an inhibitor of LDHA, suppressed the neuroprotective function of VGLL4 by increasing APP amyloidogenic processing. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that VGLL4 exerts a neuroprotective effect by upregulating LDHA expression and consequently promoting lactate production. Thus, this study suggests that VGLL4 may be a novel player involved in molecular mechanisms relevant for ameliorating neurodegeneration.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid-beta and brain atrophy are hallmarks for Alzheimer's Disease that can be targeted with positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI, respectively. MRI is cheaper, less-invasive, and more available than PET. There is a known relationship between amyloid-beta and brain atrophy, meaning PET images could be inferred from MRI. To build an image translation model using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network able to synthesize Amyloid-beta PET images from structural MRI. Retrospective. Eight hundred eighty-two adults (348 males/534 females) with different stages of cognitive decline (control, mild cognitive impairment, moderate cognitive impairment, and severe cognitive impairment). Five hundred fifty-two subjects for model training and 331 for testing (80%:20%). 3\u2009T, T1-weighted structural (T1w). The testing cohort was used to evaluate the performance of the model using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), comparing the likeness of the overall synthetic PET images created from structural MRI with the overall true PET images. SSIM was computed in the overall image to include the luminance, contrast, and structural similarity components. Experienced observers reviewed the images for quality, performance and tried to determine if they could tell the difference between real and synthetic images. Pixel wise Pearson correlation was significant, and had an R2 greater than 0.96 in example images. From blinded readings, a Pearson Chi-squared test showed that there was no significant difference between the real and synthetic images by the observers (P\u2009=\u20090.68). A high degree of likeness across the evaluation set, which had a mean SSIM\u2009=\u20090.905 and PSNR\u2009=\u20092.685. The two observers were not able to determine the difference between the real and synthetic images, with accuracies of 54% and 46%, respectively. Amyloid-beta PET images can be synthesized from structural MRI with a high degree of similarity to the real PET images. 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 1.",

        "AbstractText": "Objectives: Nursing home (NH) residents' capacity to communicate deteriorates with dementia. Consequently, NHs with high proportions of people living with dementia (PLWD) may receive fewer resident complaints, and/or investigating complaints may be challenging. We assessed NHs' proportion of PLWD in relation to total and substantiated complaints.Methods: Data were from the ASPEN Complaints/Incident Tracking System and the Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reports (2017). NHs (N\u2009=\u200915,499) were categorized based on high (top-10%), medium (middle-80%), and low (bottom-10%) dementia prevalence. Negative binomial Poisson regression assessed complaint patterns in relation to NHs' high/low (vs. medium) proportions of PLWD and other facility/resident characteristics.Results: Compared to NHs with medium-dementia prevalence, NHs with low proportions of PLWD had higher total (average marginal effect [AME]\u2009=\u20090.16, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and substantiated (AME = 0.30, p\u2009<\u20090.001) complaints, whereas NHs with high proportions of PLWD had fewer total (AME=\u2009-0.07; p\u2009<\u20090.05) and substantiated (AME=\u2009-0.11, p\u2009<\u20090.05) complaints. Also, NHs' profit status, chain-affiliation, size, staffing, and resident ethnicity were associated with total and substantiated complaints.Conclusion: The association between high proportions of PLWD and lower NH complaints suggests either that these NHs have higher overall quality or that complaints are underreported. Regardless, surveyors and families may need more involvement in monitoring higher dementia prevalence facilities.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid-like protein assemblies have been associated with toxic phenotypes because of their repetitive and stable structure. However, evidence that cells exploit these structures to control function and activity of some proteins in response to stimuli has questioned this paradigm. How amyloid-like assembly can confer emergent functions and how cells couple assembly with environmental conditions remains unclear. Here, we study Rim4, an RNA-binding protein that forms translation-repressing assemblies during yeast meiosis. We demonstrate that in its assembled and repressive state, Rim4 binds RNA more efficiently than in its monomeric and idle state, revealing a causal connection between assembly and function. The Rim4-binding site location within the transcript dictates whether the assemblies can repress translation, underscoring the importance of the architecture of this RNA-protein structure for function. Rim4 assembly depends exclusively on its intrinsically disordered region and is prevented by the Ras/protein kinase A signaling pathway, which promotes growth and suppresses meiotic entry in yeast. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby cells couple a functional protein assembly with a stimulus to enforce a cell fate decision.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most concerned neurodegenerative disorders across the world characterized by amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), leading to cognitive decline and memory loss. Targeting key pathways involved in AD like A\u03b2 and NFT pathways, are crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In this study, we aimed to identify and establish promising dual inhibitors targeting BACE1 and GSK-3\u03b2, two proteins implicated in A\u03b2 and NFT formation respectively. We have used molecular docking, ADME property analysis, and MMGBSA calculations for the identification of hit molecules and further evaluation of binding affinity, drug-like properties, and stability against BACE1 and GSK-3\u03b2. Our results demonstrated strong binding affinities of ZINC000034853956 towards the active sites of both proteins, with favorable interactions involving key residues crucial for inhibitory activity. Additionally, ZINC000034853956 exhibited favorable drug-like properties. MD simulations revealed the stable binding of ZINC000034853956 to both BACE1 and GSK-3\u03b2 over a 50 ns period, with consistent ligand-protein interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts. These findings highlight the potential of ZINC000034853956 as a promising candidate for AD treatment, acting as a dual inhibitor targeting both BACE1 and GSK-3\u03b2. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the potential of ZINC000034853956 as a dual inhibitor for AD. The strong binding affinity, favorable drug-like properties, and stability observed in MD simulations support its suitability for further optimization and preclinical studies. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms and therapeutic benefits of ZINC000034853956. Our findings offer hope for the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting crucial pathways involved in AD neurodegeneration.",

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is widely used in the study of CBF in patients with MCI. However, alterations in CBF connectivity in these patients remain poorly understood. In this study, 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D-pCASL) technology was used to investigate the changes in regional CBF and CBF connectivity between 32 MCI patients and 32 healthy controls. The normalized CBF was used to reduce inter-subject variations. Both group comparisons in the CBF and correlations between CBF alterations and cognitive scores were assessed. CBF connectivity of brain regions with regional CBF differences was also compared between groups. We found that compared with that in controls, the CBF was significantly reduced in the left superior parietal gyrus in MCI patients, whereas it was increased in the left precentral gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right putamen, and left supplementary motor area. In patients with MCI, significant correlations were identified between CBF and neuropsychological scales. Importantly, MCI patients exhibited CBF disconnections between the left supplementary motor area and the left superior parietal gyrus. This study found that there are not only changes in regional CBF but also in CBF connectivity patterns in MCI patients compared with controls. These observations may provide a novel explanation for the neural mechanism underlying the pathophysiology in patients with Alzheimer's disease and MCI.",

This is increasing exposure to humankind and affecting health in various ways. Alternation in cognition is one among them. Epidemiological research has reflected the impact of arsenic exposure on children in the form of diminished cognition. Considering this fact, the present study reviewed the impact of arsenic on amyloid precursor protein, which is known to cause one of the commonest cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The present study reviews the arsenic role in the generation of amyloid-beta from its precursor that leads to Alzheimer's disease through the published article from Pubmed and Scopus. According to the findings, regular, long-term exposure to arsenic beginning in infancy changes numerous arsenic level-regulating regions in the rat brain, which are related to cognitive impairments. Arsenic also affects the BBB clearance route by increasing RAGE expression. Arsenic triggers the proamyloidogenic pathway by increasing APP expression and subsequently, its processing by \u03b2-secretase and presenilin. Arsenic also affects mitochondrial dynamics, DNA repair pathway and epigenetic changes. The mechanism behind all these changes is explained in the present review article. A raised level of arsenic exposure affects the amyloid precursor protein, a factor for the early precipitation of Alzheimer's disease.",

Cognitive decline in community cohorts is often due to multiple pathologies; however, the frequency and contributions of these pathologies to cognitive impairment in people exposed to RHI is unknown. Here, we examined the relative contributions of 13 neuropathologies to cognitive symptoms and dementia in RHI-exposed brain donors. Neuropathologists examined brain tissue from 571 RHI-exposed donors and assessed for the presence of 13 neuropathologies, including CTE, Alzheimer disease (AD), Lewy body disease (LBD), and TDP-43 inclusions. Cognitive status was assessed by presence of dementia, Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), and Cognitive Difficulties Scale (CDS). Spearman's rho was calculated to assess intercorrelation of pathologies. Additionally, frequencies of pathological co-occurrence were compared to a simulated distribution assuming no intercorrelation. Logistic and linear regressions tested associations between neuropathologies and dementia status and cognitive scale scores. The sample age range was 18-97 (median: 65.0 [IQR 46.0-76.0]). 77.2% of donors had at least one moderate-severe neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular pathology. Stage III-IV CTE was the most common neurodegenerative disease (43.1%), followed by TDP-43 pathology, AD, and hippocampal sclerosis. Neuropathologies were intercorrelated and there were fewer unique combinations than expected if pathologies were independent (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The greatest contributors to dementia were AD, neocortical LBD, hippocampal sclerosis, CAA, and CTE. In this sample of RHI-exposed brain donors with wide-ranging ages, multiple neuropathologies were common and correlated. Mixed neuropathologies, including CTE, underlie cognitive impairment in contact sport athletes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

This study aims to investigate the temporal course of these subtypes and identify the impact of functional, neuropsychiatric, and comorbid medical conditions on prognosis. Additionally, the relationship between hippocampal atrophy, white matter intensities, and disease progression will be examined, along with the identification of key covariates influencing slow or fast progression in non-Alzheimer's dementias. A total of 196 patients with non-Alzheimer's dementias who underwent at least three comprehensive evaluations were included, with proportions of VaD, FTD, LBD, and PDD being 50, 19.39, 19.90, and 10.71%, respectively. Patient demographics, comorbidities, neuropsychiatric and neuroimaging parameters, and global evaluation were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The study followed patients for a mean duration of 62.57\u2009\u00b1\u200933.45\u2009months (ranging from 11 to 198\u2009months). The results from three different visits for each non-AD dementia case demonstrated significant differences in various measures across visits, including functional capacity (BDLAS), cognition (MMSE), and other neuropsychological tests. Notably, certain genotypes and hippocampal atrophy grades were more prevalent in specific subtypes. The results indicate that Fazekas grading and hippocampal atrophy were significant predictors of disease progression, while epilepsy, extrapyramidal symptoms, thyroid dysfunction, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, hyperlipidemia, sleep disorders, smoking, and family history of dementia were not significant predictors. BDLAS and EDLAS scores at the first and second visits showed significant associations with disease progression, while scores at the third visit did not. Group-based trajectory analysis revealed that non-AD cases separated into two reliable subgroups with slow/fast prognosis, showing high reliability (Entropy\u2009=\u20090.790, 51.8 vs. 48.2%). This study provides valuable insights into the temporal course and prognostic factors of non-Alzheimer's dementias.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted between January and March 2020 with six people living with dementia and 15 family carers. Inductive and deductive techniques were used. The latter was informed by Link and Phelan's (2001) sociological theory of stigma. Dementia was commonly viewed by people living with dementia as part of ageing and carers reported low levels awareness about the condition. To avoid negative reactions from people, people living with dementia managed the negative views of dementia by minimising and normalising the condition, by expressing their ability to live an active life, and by emphasising the positive impacts of dementia in their lives. Fear of negative reactions appeared to lead to a selective disclosure of their diagnosis. Among carers, stigmatising attitudes coincided with a strong willingness to provide good care, to protect the person cared for, as well as to understand and validate their caring experiences, rather than to cause harm. In doing so, however, carers ended up depersonalising and infantilising people living with dementia, underestimating their capacities, demanding 'obedience', and restricting their freedom.

Moreover, drug prediction and molecular docking were also performed. Subsequently, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to further verify the findings. Finally, RT-qPCR validation was performed. The characterization of 12\u2009AD-related CRGs was evaluated in AD, and a diagnostic model for AD showed a satisfying discrimination power based on five CRGs by LASSO regression analysis. The dysregulated CRGs and activated immune responses partially differed between patients with AD and healthy subjects. Furthermore, two molecular subtypes (clusters A and B) with different immune infiltration characteristics in AD were identified. Similarly, a diagnostic model for different AD subtypes was built with nine CRGs, which achieved a good performance. Molecular docking revealed the optimum conformation of CHEMBL261454 and its target gene CSNK1D, which was further validated by MD simulation. The RT-qPCR results were consistent with those of the comprehensive analysis.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis in its early stages remains difficult with current diagnostic approaches. Though tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) generally follow the stereotypical pattern described by the Braak staging scheme, the network degeneration hypothesis (NDH) has suggested that NFTs spread selectively along functional networks of the brain. To evaluate this, we implemented a Bayesian workflow to develop hierarchical multinomial logistic regression models with increasing levels of complexity of the brain from tau-PET and structural MRI data to investigate whether it is beneficial to incorporate network-level information into an ROI-based predictive model for the presence/absence of AD. This study included data from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) longitudinal cohort from McGill University's Research Centre for Studies in Aging (MCSA). Baseline and 1\u2009year follow-up structural MRI and [18F]MK-6240 tau-PET scans were acquired for 72 cognitive normal (CN), 23 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 18 Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects. We constructed the four following hierarchical Bayesian models in order of increasing complexity: (Model 1) a complete-pooling model with observations, (Model 2) a partial-pooling model with observations clustered within ROIs, (Model 3) a partial-pooling model with observations clustered within functional networks, and (Model 4) a partial-pooling model with observations clustered within ROIs that are also clustered within functional brain networks. We then investigated which of the models had better predictive performance given tau-PET or structural MRI data as an input, in the form of a relative annualized rate of change. The Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) estimate of the expected log pointwise predictive density (ELPD) results indicated that models 3 and 4 were substantially better than other models for both tau-PET and structural MRI inputs. For tau-PET data, model 3 was slightly better than 4 with an absolute difference in ELPD of 3.10\u2009\u00b1\u20091.30. For structural MRI data, model 4 was considerably better than other models with an absolute difference in ELPD of 29.83\u2009\u00b1\u20097.55 relative to model 3, the second-best model. Our results suggest that representing the data generating process in terms of a hierarchical model that encompasses both ROI-level and network-level heterogeneity leads to better predictive ability for both tau-PET and structural MRI inputs over all other model iterations.",

Thirty eight mild AD patients with sleep disturbances and 21 mild AD patients without sleep disturbances participated in this study. All subjects underwent neuropsychological assessments and 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance scanning. Static and dynamic regional homogeneity (ReHo) were used to represent the local functional connectivity. Seed-based whole-brain functional connectivity was used to represent the remote functional connectivity. The seed was chosen based on the results of ReHo. Compared to ADNSD, ADSD showed decreased static ReHo in the left posterior central gyrus and the right cuneus and increased dynamic ReHo in the left posterior central gyrus. As for the remote functional connectivity, comparing ADSD to ADNSD, it was found that there was a decreased functional connection between the left posterior central gyrus and the left cuneus as well as the left calcarine. The current study demonstrated that, compared with ADNSD, ADSD is impaired in both local and remote functional connectivity, manifested as reduced functional connectivity involving the primary sensory network and the primary visual network. The abnormality of the above functional connectivity is one of the reasons why sleep disorders promote cognitive impairment in AD. Moreover, sleep disorders change the temporal sequence of AD pathological damage to brain functional networks, but more evidence is needed to support this conclusion.",

The occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease involves many processes. In response to the complex pathogenesis of AD, the Traditional Chinese medicine formula Liuwei Dihuang Pill (LWD) has been shown to improve the cognitive function of AD animal models. However, the active ingredients and mechanism of action of LWD have not been fully elucidated. In this study, network pharmacological analysis predicted 40 candidate compounds in LWD, acting on 227 potential targets, of which 185 were associated with AD. Through network pharmacological analysis, the mechanism of action of LWD therapy AD is related to the inhibition of inflammatory response, regulation of neuronal state, and autophagy. In this experiment, LWD was detected in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model. The objective was to observe the effects of LWD on hippocampal learning and memory ability, A\u03b2 clearance, autophagy and inflammatory response in APP/PS1 mice. The results showed that LWD improved long-term memory and working memory in APP/PS1 mice compared with the WT group. At the same time, LWD can increase the expression of hippocampal autophagy biomarkers, reduce the precipitation of A\u03b2, and the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Its mechanism may be related to the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that LWD has a neuroprotective effect on APP/PS1 mice and provide theoretical foundation for the development of a new clinical treatment for AD.",

To study the influence of CMDs on cognitive ability and whether they are related longitudinally to development of clinical signs of Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome. We followed 115 individuals with Down syndrome, 27 of whom were diagnosed with a CMD, over approximately 3 years. Changes in cognitive and behavioural outcomes between baseline and follow-up assessment were analysed, with comparisons made between those with and without a comorbid CMD. Age, gender, apolipoprotein E status and level of intellectual disability were included as covariates. No significant association between presence of a CMD and poorer performance on cognitive tasks or informant-rated decline over time was observed (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that a diagnosis of a CMD does not have a significant negative effect on long-term cognitive or behavioural outcomes in individuals with Down syndrome. In individuals with stable or treated CMD, subsequent cognitive decline is likely indicative of Alzheimer's disease rather than a consequence of mental disorder.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, and its incidence increases yearly. Because AD patients will have cognitive impairment and personality changes, it has caused a heavy burden on the family and society. Image genetics takes the structure and function of the brain as a phenotype and studies the influence of genetic variation on the structure and function of the brain. Based on the structural magnetic resonance imaging data and transcriptome data of AD and healthy control samples in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Disease database, this paper proposed the use of an orthogonal structured sparse canonical correlation analysis for diagnostic information fusion algorithm. The algorithm added structural constraints to the region of interest (ROI) of the brain. Integrating the diagnostic information of samples can improve the correlation performance between samples. The results showed that the algorithm could extract the correlation between the two modal data and discovered the brain regions most affected by multiple risk genes and their biological significance. In addition, we also verified the diagnostic significance of risk ROIs and risk genes for AD. The code of the proposed algorithm is available at https://github.com/Wanguangyu111/OSSCCA-DIF.",

        "AbstractText": "The subject of hyponatremia is undergoing significant changes after developing a more pathophysiologic approach that is superior to the ineffective volume approach and can more effectively identify the different causes of hyponatremia. This new approach identified cerebral salt wasting (CSW) in 24 (38%) of 62 hyponatremic patients from the medical wards of the hospital with 21 showing no evidence of cerebral disease to support our proposal to change CSW to renal salt wasting (RSW). RSW had to be differentiated from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) because of diametrically opposite therapeutic goals of water-restricting water-logged patients with SIADH or administering salt water to volume-depleted patients with RSW. Both syndromes present with identical clinical parameters that require a difficult protocol to make such a differentiation possible. We describe rat clearance studies demonstrating natriuretic activity in the plasma of patients with neurosurgical and Alzheimer diseases (AD) and eventually identify the protein as haptoglobin-related protein without signal peptide, which can serve as a biomarker to simplify diagnosis of RSW and delivery of the proper management to improve clinical outcomes. We also discuss the introduction of a new syndrome of RSW in AD and its implications. The high prevalence of RSW and identification of the natriuretic factor have created debates over the existence of RSW with none questioning or addressing the pathophysiologic data that identified patients with RSW. We also discuss the potentially large group of patients with RSW who are normonatremic.",

        "AbstractText": "The mismatch between the limited availability versus the high demand of participants who are in the pre-dementia phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a bottleneck for clinical studies in AD. Nevertheless, potential enrollment barriers in the pre-dementia population are relatively under-reported. In a large European longitudinal biomarker study (the AMYPAD-PNHS), we investigated main enrollment barriers in individuals with no or mild symptoms recruited from research and clinical parent cohorts (PCs) of ongoing observational studies. Logistic regression was used to predict study refusal based on sex, age, education, global cognition (MMSE), family history of dementia, and number of prior study visits. Study refusal rates and categorized enrollment barriers were compared between PCs using chi-squared tests. 535/1856 (28.8%) of the participants recruited from ongoing studies declined participation in the AMYPAD-PNHS. Only for participants recruited from clinical PCs (n\u2009=\u2009243), a higher MMSE-score (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.22, OR\u2009=\u20090.80, p\u2009<\u2009.05), more prior study visits (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.93, OR\u2009=\u20090.40, p\u2009<\u2009.001), and positive family history of dementia (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.08, OR\u2009=\u20098.02, p\u2009<\u2009.01) resulted in lower odds on study refusal.

The enrollment rate for the AMYPAD-PNHS was relatively high, suggesting an advantage of recruitment via ongoing studies. In this observational cohort, study burden reduction and tailored strategies may potentially improve participant enrollment into trial readiness cohorts such as for phase-3 early anti-amyloid intervention trials.

Studying gene-environment interactions can help develop personalized early intervention strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no studies have examined the relationship between screen-based sedentary activities and genetic susceptibility to AD risk, and further understanding of the causal relationship is also crucial. This study included 462,524 participants from the UK Biobank with a follow-up of 13.6\u00a0years. Participants' screen-based sedentary activities time was categorized into three groups based on recorded time:\u2009\u2265\u20094\u00a0h/day, 2-3\u00a0h/day, and\u2009\u2264\u20091\u00a0h/day. Cox proportional risk models were used to analyze the association between computer use/TV viewing groups and the risk of all-cause dementia, AD and vascular dementia (VD).

In addition, a causal effect of TV viewing times was observed on AD analyzed using MR Egger (OR\u2009=\u20095.618, 95%CI:1.502-21.013, P\u2009<\u20090.05). There was a causal effect between TV viewing time and AD analyzed using bidirectional MR, and more TV viewing time exposure was correlated with a higher AD risk. Therefore, it is recommended that people with intermediate and high AD-GRS should control their TV viewing time to be less than 4\u00a0h/ day or even less than 1\u00a0h/day.",

Male Wistar rats received streptozotocin (STZ icv, 3\u00a0mg/kg diluted in aCFS, 5\u00a0\u00b5l/ventricle) and were treated for 21\u00a0days with EXE-4 (10\u00a0\u00b5g/kg, ip; saline as the vehicle). Four groups were formed: vehicle, EXE-4, STZ, and STZ\u2009+\u2009EXE-4. The groups were submitted to Y-Maze (YM), object recognition (ORT), and object displacement tasks (ODT) to assess learning and memory. The brains were used for immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques with antibodies to NeuN, cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), PCNA, doublecortin (DCX), synaptophysin (SYP), and insulin receptor (IR). STZ worsened spatial memory in the YMT, as well as short-term (STM) and long-term (LTM) memories in the ORT and ODT, respectively. EXE-4 protected against memory impairment in STZ animals. STZ reduced mature neuron density (NeuN) and increased cell apoptosis (CC3) in the DG, CA1, and CA3. EXE-4 protected against neuronal death in all regions. EXE-4 increased PCNA+ cells in all regions of the hippocampus, and STZ attenuated this effect. STZ reduced neurogenesis in DG per se as well as synaptogenesis induced by EXE-4. EXE-4 increased immunoreactivity to IR in the CA1. From these findings, EXE-4 showed a beneficial effect on hippocampal pyramidal and granular neurons in the SDAT showing anti-apoptotic properties and promoting cell proliferation. In parallel, EXE-4 preserved the memory of SDAT rats. EXE-4 appears to enhance synapses at CA3 and DG. In conclusion, these data indicate that agonists to GLP-1R have a beneficial effect on hippocampal neurons in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule-binding protein tau in the brain is a key pathological marker for Alzheimer's disease and additional neurodegenerative tauopathies. However, how hyperphosphorylated tau causes cellular dysfunction or death that underlies neurodegeneration remains an unsolved question critical for the understanding of disease mechanism and the design of efficacious drugs. Using a recombinant hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) synthesized by the PIMAX approach, we examined how cells responded to the cytotoxic tau and explored means to enhance cellular resistance to tau attack. Upon p-tau uptake, the intracellular calcium levels rose promptly. Gene expression analyses revealed that p-tau potently triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress-associated apoptosis, and pro-inflammation in cells. Proteomics studies showed that p-tau diminished heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an ER stress-associated anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress regulator, while stimulated the accumulation of MIOS and other proteins. p-Tau-induced ER stress-associated apoptosis and pro-inflammation are ameliorated by apomorphine, a brain-permeable prescription drug widely used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, and by overexpression of HO-1. Our results reveal probable cellular functions targeted by hyperphosphorylated tau. Some of these dysfunctions and stress responses have been linked to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The observations that the ill effects of p-tau can be mitigated by a small compound and by overexpressing HO-1 that is otherwise diminished in the treated cells inform new directions of Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.",

        "AbstractText": "The mechanisms that confer cognitive resilience to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are not fully understood. Here, we describe a neural circuit mechanism underlying this resilience in a familial AD mouse model. In the prodromal disease stage, interictal epileptiform spikes (IESs) emerge during anesthesia in the CA1 and mPFC regions, leading to working memory disruptions. These IESs are driven by inputs from the thalamic nucleus reuniens (nRE). Indeed, tonic deep brain stimulation of the nRE (tDBS-nRE) effectively suppresses IESs and restores firing rate homeostasis under anesthesia, preventing further impairments in nRE-CA1 synaptic facilitation and working memory. Notably, applying tDBS-nRE during the prodromal phase in young APP/PS1 mice mitigates age-dependent memory decline. The IES rate during anesthesia in young APP/PS1 mice correlates with later working memory impairments. These findings highlight the nRE as a central hub of functional resilience and underscore the clinical promise of DBS in conferring resilience to AD pathology by restoring circuit-level homeostasis.",

        "AbstractText": "Many aging individuals accumulate the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) without evidence of cognitive decline. Here we describe an integrated neurodegeneration checkpoint response to early pathological changes that restricts further disease progression and preserves cognitive function. Checkpoint activation is mediated by the REST transcriptional repressor, which is induced in cognitively-intact aging humans and AD mouse models at the onset of amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) deposition and tau accumulation. REST induction is mediated by the unfolded protein response together with \u03b2-catenin signaling. A consequence of this response is the targeting of REST to genes involved in key pathogenic pathways, resulting in downregulation of gamma secretase, tau kinases, and pro-apoptotic proteins. Deletion of REST in the 3xTg and J20 AD mouse models accelerates A\u03b2 deposition and the accumulation of misfolded and phosphorylated tau, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Conversely, viral-mediated overexpression of REST in the hippocampus suppresses A\u03b2 and tau pathology. Thus, REST mediates a neurodegeneration checkpoint response with multiple molecular targets that may\u00a0protect against the onset of AD.",

EOAD affects individuals\u00a0<65\u00a0years old, and accounts for 5%-10% of all AD cases. Previous studies on EOAD primarily focused on familial forms, whereas research on sporadic EOAD (sEOAD), which represents 85%-90% of EOAD cases, is limited. In this prospective cohort study, participants were recruited between 2018 and 2023 and included patients with sEOAD (n\u00a0=\u00a0110), late-onset AD (LOAD, n\u00a0=\u00a089), young controls (YC, n\u00a0=\u00a050), and older controls (OC, n\u00a0=\u00a025).

        "AbstractText": "The presence of protein aggregates is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Traditionally, each disease has been associated with the aggregation of specific proteins, which serve as disease-specific biomarkers. For example, aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) are found in \u03b1-synucleinopathies such as PD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Similarly, AD is characterized by aggregates of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau proteins. However, it has been observed that these protein aggregates can also occur in other neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to disease progression. For instance, \u03b1-syn aggregates have been detected in AD, Down syndrome, Huntington's disease, prion diseases, and various forms of FTLD. Similarly, A\u03b2 aggregates have been found in conditions like DLB and PD. Tau aggregates, in addition to being present in primary tauopathies, have been identified in prion diseases, \u03b1-synucleinopathies, and cognitively healthy aged subjects. Finally, aggregates of TDP-43, typically associated with FTLD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have been observed in AD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), MSA, DLB, and other neurodegenerative diseases. These findings highlight the complexity of protein aggregation in neurodegeneration and suggest potential interactions and common mechanisms underlying different diseases. A deeper understating of this complex scenario may eventually lead to the identification of a better elucidation of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these devastating conditions and hopefully new therapeutic stragegies.",

According to the most widely accepted concept, the production and aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides play a critical role in AD. As a result, therapeutic intervention with these processes is the focus of intense research. The A\u03b2 peptide is cleaved by the \u03b1-secretase, \u03b2-secretase, and \u03b3-secretase enzymes in a region near the pathogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) and mutations occurring site. In the current review, a complete picture of the risk factors behind AD has been investigated. Mutations involved in AD progression have also been screened in various studies. Most of the mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) can lead to the accumulation of APP oligomers in the brain, leading to AD. Several point mutations in APP can cause familial AD (FAD), including the Swedish mutation (K>M670/671N>L) and the A673>V mutation. The pathogenic A673>V mutation and Swedish mutation (M670>K/N671>L) are present in the same region of amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, the A673>T mutation has been shown to confer protection against AD. More investigations are needed from geographically distinct regions on mutations associated with AD development and applications of nanomedicines for better management of the disease burden in the future. Nanotechnology-produced metal nanoparticles (NPs) have gotten much attention because of their wide range of uses in the medicinal and agricultural industries.

Methods: We analyzed [18F]PI-2620 PET data from 65 patients with clinical diagnoses associated with AD or FTLD neuropathology; most (60/65) also had amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) PET. Scans were acquired 30-60\u2009min after injection; SUVr maps (reference, inferior cerebellar cortex) were created for the full acquisition and for 10-min truncated sliding windows (30-40, 35-45,\u202650-60\u2009min). Age- and sex-adjusted z score maps were computed for each patient, relative to 23 A\u03b2-negative cognitively healthy controls (HC). Mean SUVr in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nuclei, dentate nuclei, white matter, and temporal gray matter was extracted for the full and truncated windows. Results: Patients with suspected AD neuropathology (A\u03b2-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia) showed high-intensity temporoparietal cortex-predominant [18F]PI-2620 binding. At the group level, patients with clinical diagnoses associated with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome [PSP Richardson syndrome], corticobasal syndrome, and nonfluent-variant primary progressive aphasia) exhibited higher globus pallidus SUVr than did HCs; pallidal retention was highest in the PSP Richardson syndrome group, in whom SUVr was correlated with symptom severity (\u03c1 = 0.53, P = 0.05). At the individual level, only half of PSP Richardson syndrome, corticobasal syndrome, and nonfluent-variant primary progressive aphasia patients had a pallidal SUVr above that of HCs. Temporal SUVr discriminated AD patients from HCs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.83-1.00]) for all time windows, whereas discrimination between patients with PSP Richardson syndrome and HCs using pallidal SUVr was fair regardless of time window (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61-0.92] at 30-40\u2009min vs. 0.81 [95% CI, 0.66-0.96] at 50-60\u2009min; P = 0.67). Conclusion: [18F]PI-2620 SUVr shows an intense and consistent signal in AD but lower-intensity, heterogeneous, and rapidly decreasing binding in patients with suspected FTLD.

Additionally, OGA inhibitors have been important for defining the augmentation of O-GlcNAc as a promising disease-modifying approach to combat several neurodegenerative diseases including both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. These studies have led to development and optimization of OGA inhibitors for clinical application. These compounds have been shown to be well tolerated in early clinical studies and are steadily advancing into the clinic.

        "AbstractText": "In humans, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically sporadic in nature, and its pathology is usually influenced by extensive factors. The study established a rat model based on the genetic-environmental interaction. A rat model was established by transduction of an adeno-associated virus combined with acrolein treatment. Rats were assigned to the normal control (NC), acrolein group, AAV (-) group, AAV-APP group, and AAV-APP/acrolein group. The success of model construction was verified in multiple ways, including by assessing cognitive function, examining microstructural changes in the brain in vivo, and performing immunohistochemistry. The contribution of genetic (APP mutation) and environmental (acrolein) factors to AD-like phenotypes in the model was explored by factorial analysis. 1) The AAV-APP/acrolein group showed a decline in cognitive function, as indicated by a reduced gray matter volume in key cognition-related brain areas, lower FA values in the hippocampus and internal olfactory cortex, and A\u03b2 deposition in the cortex and hippocampus. 2) The AAV-APP group also showed a decline in cognitive function, although the group exhibited atypical brain atrophy in the gray matter and insignificant A\u03b2 deposition. 3) The acrolein group did not show any significant changes in A\u03b2 levels, gray matter volume, or cognitive function. 4) The genetic factor (APP mutation) explained 39.74% of the AD-like phenotypes in the model factors, and the environmental factor (acrolein exposure) explained 33.3%. The genetic-environmental interaction rat model exhibited a phenotype that resembled the features of human AD and will be useful for research on AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks include amyloid-\u03b2eta (A\u03b2) and tau proteins aggregates, neurite degeneration, microglial activation with cognitive impairment. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/Glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (PI3K/AKT/GSK-3) pathway is essential for neuroprotection, cell survival and proliferation by blocking apoptosis. This study aimed to assess protective role of nanocurcumin (NCMN) as strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent with elucidating its synergistic effects with Donepezil as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on AD in rats via modulating PI3K/AKT/GSK-3\u03b2 pathway. The experiment was performed on 70 male Wistar albino rats divided into seven groups (control, NCMN, Donepezil, AD-model, Donepezil co-treatment, NCMN only co-treatment, and NCMN+Donepezil combined treatment). Behavioral and biochemical investigations as cholinesterase activity, oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, nitric oxide, superoxidedismutase, and catalase), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Tau, \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), Phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1), Glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK-3\u03b2) and toll-like receptor-4 were evaluated.

        "AbstractText": "Autophagy is a self-degradative process important for balancing the sources of energy and involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, a number of papers have shown that elastin-derived peptides (EDPs) affect the expression and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), which is crucial for the development of AD and autophagy initiation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether EDPs with a Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly (VGVAPG) amino acid sequence activate the autophagic process in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Our study is the first to show that EDPs with the VGVAPG sequence initiate the autophagy process in the undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cell line exhibiting a number of features of normal neuroblasts. In particular, we observed in our study that VGAVPG peptide increased ULK1, AKT, PPAR\u03b3, and LC3B protein expression. Moreover, our experiments with the agonist (rosiglitazone) and antagonist (GW9662) of PPAR\u03b3 confirm that the studied EDP acts through the PPAR\u03b3 pathway affecting mTOR and finally autophagy. Some studies have shown that autophagy disturbances are involved in the development of AD. Therefore, we believe that our study will provide new evidence of the possible involvement of EDPs (especially VGVAPG) in the development of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Fe65 is a brain enriched adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton regulation, DNA repair and transcription. A well-studied interacting partner of Fe65 is the transmembrane amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP), which can undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). Following \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase-mediated RIP, the released APP intracellular domain (AICD) together with Fe65 can translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription. In this study, we investigated if Fe65 nuclear localization can also be regulated by different \u03b1-secretases, also known to participate in RIP of APP and other transmembrane proteins. We found that in both Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and all-trans retinoic acid differentiated neuroblastoma cells a strong negative impact on Fe65 nuclear localization, equal to the effect observed upon \u03b3-secretase inhibition, could be detected following inhibition of all three (ADAM9, ADAM10 and ADAM17) \u03b1-secretases. Moreover, using the comet assay and analysis of Fe65 dependent DNA repair associated posttranslational modifications of histones, we could show that inhibition of \u03b1-secretase-mediated Fe65 nuclear translocation resulted in impaired capacity of the cells to repair DNA damage. Taken together this suggests that \u03b1-secretase processing of APP and/or other Fe65 interacting transmembrane proteins play an important role in regulating Fe65 nuclear translocation and DNA repair.",

        "AbstractText": "Maintaining the proteome is crucial to retaining cell functionality and response to multiple intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. Protein misfolding increased the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated the adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore cell homeostasis. Apoptosis occurs when ER stress is prolonged or the adaptive response fails. In healthy young cells, the ratio of protein folding machinery to quantities of misfolded proteins is balanced under normal circumstances. However, the age-related deterioration of the complex systems for handling protein misfolding is accompanied by ageing-related disruption of protein homeostasis, which results in the build-up of misfolded and aggregated proteins. This ultimately results in decreased cell viability and forms the basis of common age-related diseases called protein misfolding diseases. Proteins or protein fragments convert from their ordinarily soluble forms to insoluble fibrils or plaques in many of these disorders, which build up in various organs such as the liver, brain, or spleen. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type II diabetes, and cancer are diseases in this group commonly manifest in later life. Thus, protein misfolding and its prevention by chaperones and different degradation paths are becoming understood from molecular perspectives. Proteodynamics information will likely affect future interventional techniques to combat cellular stress and support healthy ageing by avoiding and treating protein conformational disorders. This review provides an overview of the diverse proteostasis machinery, protein misfolding, and ER stress involvement, which activates the UPR sensors. Here, we will discuss the crosstalk between protein misfolding and ER stress and their role in developing age-related diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Commonly occurring dementias include those of Alzheimer's, vascular, and mixtures of these and other pathologies. They are believed to evolve over many years, but that time interval has been difficult to establish. Our objective is to determine how many years in advance of a dementia diagnosis cognitive scores begin to change. 14,086 dementia-free ARIC participants underwent a cognitive exam at baseline visit 2 (1990-1992, mean age 57\u00b15.72), and in 11,244 at visit 4 (1996-1998), 5,640 at visit 5 (2011-2013), and 3,574 at visit 6 (2016-2017) with surveillance for dementias of all causes combined. Within 5-year intervals after each visit, we compared performance on the Delayed Word Recall Test (DWRT), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the Word Fluency Test (WFT), and the combined mean of three cognitive tests at baseline in participants who were diagnosed with dementia within each interval versus those who survived the interval without a dementia diagnosis. Z-scores were adjusted for demographics and education in separate regression models for each visit. We plotted adjusted z-score means by time interval following each visit. During follow-up 3,334, 2,821, 1,218, and 329 dementia cases were ascertained after visits 2, 4, 5, and 6 respectively. Adjusted DWRT z-scores were significantly lower 20-25 years before dementia than those who did not experience dementia within 25 years. DSST z-scores were significantly lower at 25-30 years and 3-test combination z-scores were significantly lower as early as 30-31 years before onset. The difference between dementia and non-dementia group in the visit 2 3-test combination z-score was -0.20 at 30-31 years prior to dementia diagnosis. As expected, differences between the dementia and non-dementia groups increased closer to the time of dementia occurrence, up to their widest point at 0-5 years prior to dementia diagnosis. The difference between dementia and non-dementia groups in the visit 2 3-test combination z-score was -0.90. WFT z-score differences were smaller than for the DSST or DWRT and began later. Patterns were similar in Black and White participants. DWRT, DSST and combined 3-test z-scores were significantly lower more than 20 years prior to diagnosis in the dementia group versus the non-dementia group. Findings contribute to our knowledge of the long prodromal period in Blacks and Whites.",

NPY naturally binds to G-protein coupled receptors, activating the Y-receptors (Y1-Y5 and y6). The findings on numerous therapeutic applications of NPY for CNS disease are presented in this review by the authors. New targets for treating diseases will be revealed by medication combinations that target NPY and its receptors. This review is mainly focused on disorders such as anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Machado Joseph disease, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, depression, migraine, alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorder. The findings from the preclinical studies and clinical studies covered in this article may help create efficient therapeutic plans to treat neurological conditions on the one hand and psychiatric disorders on the other.

        "AbstractText": "The short association fibers or U-fibers travel in the superficial white matter (SWM) beneath the cortical layer. While the U-fibers play a crucial role in various brain disorders, there is a lack of effective tools to reconstruct their highly curved trajectory from diffusion MRI (dMRI). In this work, we propose a novel surface-based framework for the probabilistic tracking of fibers on the triangular mesh representation of the SWM. By deriving a closed-form solution to transform the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients of 3D fiber orientation distributions (FODs) to local coordinate systems on each triangle, we develop a novel approach to project the FODs onto the tangent space of the SWM. After that, we utilize parallel transport to realize the intrinsic propagation of streamlines on SWM following probabilistically sampled fiber directions. Our intrinsic and surface-based method eliminates the need to perform the necessary but challenging sharp turns in 3D compared with conventional volume-based tractography methods. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we performed quantitative comparisons to demonstrate the proposed algorithm can more effectively reconstruct the U-fibers connecting the precentral and postcentral gyrus than previous methods. Quantitative validations were then performed on post-mortem MRIs to show the reconstructed U-fibers from our method more faithfully follow the SWM than volume-based tractography. Finally, we applied our algorithm to study the parietal U-fiber connectivity changes in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) patients and successfully detected significant associations between U-fiber connectivity and disease severity.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The probable role of tissue plasminogen activator/neuroserpin axis in Alzheimer's disease: a new perspective.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia associated with amyloid beta (A\u03b2) deposition. Dysfunction of the neuronal clearance pathway promotes the accumulation of A\u03b2. The plasminogen-activating system (PAS) is controlled by various enzymes like tissue plasminogen activators (tPA). Neuronal tPA enhances the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which cleaves A\u03b2; this function is controlled by many inhibitors of PAS, including a plasminogen-activating inhibitor (PAI-1) and neuroserpin. Therefore, the objective of the present narrative review was to explore the potential role of tPA/neuroserpin in the pathogenesis of AD. PAI-1 activity is increased in AD, which is involved in accumulating A\u03b2. Progressive increase of A\u03b2 level during AD neuropathology is correlated with the over-production of PAI-1 with subsequent reduction of plasmin and tPA activities. Reducing plasmin and tPA activities promote A\u03b2 by reducing A\u03b2 clearance. Neuroserpin plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD as it regulates the expression and accumulation of A\u03b2. Higher expression of neuroserpin inhibits the neuroprotective tPA and the generation of plasmin with subsequent reduction in the clearance of A\u03b2. These observations raise conflicting evidence on whether neuroserpin is neuroprotective or involved in AD progression. Thus, neuroserpin over-expression with subsequent reduction of tPA may propagate AD neuropathology.",

How these processes are affected by craniofacial disorders such as craniosynostosis are poorly understood. We report that raised intracranial pressure and diminished CSF flow in craniosynostosis mouse models associates with pathological changes to meningeal lymphatic vessels that affect their sprouting, expansion, and long-term maintenance. We also show that craniosynostosis affects CSF circulatory pathways and perfusion into the brain. Further, craniosynostosis exacerbates amyloid pathology and plaque buildup in Twist1+/-:5xFAD transgenic Alzheimer's disease models. Treating craniosynostosis mice with Yoda1, a small molecule agonist for Piezo1, reduces intracranial pressure and improves CSF flow, in addition to restoring meningeal lymphangiogenesis, drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes, and brain-CSF perfusion. Leveraging these findings, we show Yoda1 treatments in aged mice with reduced CSF flow and turnover improve lymphatic networks, drainage, and brain-CSF perfusion. Our results suggest CSF provides mechanical force to facilitate meningeal lymphatic growth and maintenance. Additionally, applying Yoda1 agonist in conditions with raised intracranial pressure and/or diminished CSF flow, as seen in craniosynostosis or with ageing, is a possible therapeutic option to help restore meningeal lymphatic networks and brain-CSF perfusion.",

Alzheimer's disease is a critically prolonged brain disorder that alters brain connectivity through changes in neural synchronization and desynchronization. Metastable states occur when functional connectivity patterns changes as a consequence of temporal dynamics of brain. Thus, studying metastability under EO and EC would help in understanding the cortical dynamics and its impact in early-stage Alzheimer's disease. The study estimated metastability from three methods namely frequency variance analysis, Kuramoto order parameter and through meta-state activation patterns. Frequency variance estimated from 21 EEG channels were clustered into three regions namely anterior, central and posterior to study the regional metastability analysis. Global metastability was assessed from Kuramoto order parameter and meta-state activation patterns by collating the 21 EEG channels. Reduction in metastability was observed in central regions of MCI-AD subjects through the study of frequency variance analysis. There was a marked reduction in global metastability in the patient group under resting EO condition. Reduction in meta-state activation properties such as TAS complexity, modularity and leap size in MCI-AD condition under EO condition indicates an overall reduction in brain flexibility. Taken together, the study infers an underlying structural change in neuronal dynamics influencing the reduction of metastability under MCI-AD condition.

The expression of microRNAs in serum was analyzed using the Agilent human microRNA oligonucleotide microarray, and bioinformatics methods were employed to predict target genes and their involvement in AD-related pathways. Among the 122 microRNAs screened, five microRNAs (hsa-miR-208a-5p, hsa-miR-125b-1-3p, hsa-miR-3194-3p, hsa-miR-4652-5p, and hsa-miR-4419a) exhibited differential expression and met quality control standards. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the target genes of these microRNAs were involved in multiple AD-related pathways, which changed with disease progression. These findings demonstrate significant differences in serum microRNA expression between NC, MCI, and AD patients. Three microRNAs were identified as potential candidates for the development of diagnostic models for MCI and AD. The results highlight the crucial role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD and provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and personalized treatment approaches for AD.

In all, 137 dyads (people with AD and their caregivers) underwent 2 assessments: at baseline (M1) and after 1 year (M2). During follow-up, 58 dyads were excluded, and the study was thus concluded with 79. Longitudinal analysis of the people with AD showed that while some cognitive functions declined (which is consistent with disease progression), SC impairments showed a more stable pattern. Another interesting result was related to SC predictors. For people with AD, SC was associated with cognition at both time points. For caregivers, besides cognition, other predictors included reduced functional abilities and quality of life in people with AD. These results are consistent with the discrepancy predictors. The stable pattern in SC functioning over 12 months in AD suggests that this neurocognitive domain may be influenced more by emotional processing than by cognitive impairment. In addition, the SC predictors showed that the investigation of different points of view enables a more global understanding, contributing to better and more targeted treatment for the patient.",

        "AbstractText": "The hunt for new biomarkers - for the diagnosis of subcategories of disease, or for the monitoring of the efficacy of novel therapeutics - is an increasingly relevant challenge in the current era of precision medicine. In neurodegenerative research, the aim is to look for simple tools which can predict cognitive or motor decline early, and to determine whether these can also be used to test the efficacy of new interventions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are thought to play an important role in intercellular communication and have been shown to play a vital role in a number of diseases. The aim of this review is to examine what we know about EVs in neurodegeneration and to discuss their potential to be diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in the future. It will cover the techniques used to isolate and study EVs and what is currently known about their presence in neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we will discuss what is required for standardization in biomarker research, and the challenges associated with using EVs within this framework. The technical challenges associated with isolating EVs consistently, combined with the complex techniques required for their efficient analysis, might preclude 'pure' EV populations from being used as effective biomarkers. Whilst biomarker discovery is important for more effective diagnosis, monitoring, prediction and prognosis in neurodegenerative disease, reproducibility and ease-of-use should be the priorities.",

        "AbstractText": "Activation of microglia and astrocytes has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is reported to be activated in AD and involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. Moreover, amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation is detected as a characteristic pathology in the AD brain, and is known to be a substrate of TG2. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can modify cell proliferation and differentiation, and is reported to have therapeutic effects on AD pathology. We aimed to assess the effects of ATRA in microglia and astrocytes on TG2 expression and glial functions. After treatment with ATRA, TG2 expression and TG activity were assayed in both murine microglia BV-2 cells and cultured rat brain astrocytes. Endocytosis activity in BV-2 cells and A\u03b2 aggregation by astrocytes conditioned medium were also assessed. In both BV-2 cells and cultured astrocytes, ATRA increased TG2 expression and TG activity. The increase was blocked by AGN194310, an RA receptor antagonist. ATRA enhanced the endocytosis activity in BV-2 cells, and the addition of AGN194310 reversed it. The addition of cystamine, a competitive TG inhibitor, also reduced ATRA-enhanced endocytosis activity. On the other hand, A\u03b2 aggregation was potentiated by ATRA-treated astrocytes conditioned medium compared to control astrocytes conditioned medium. These results suggest that ATRA increased TG2 expression and TG activity via RA receptor in microglia and astrocytes. ATRA-enhanced TGs might be involved in phagocytosis and A\u03b2 aggregation. Adequate control of TGs expression and function in microglia and astrocytes can be an important factor in AD pathology.",

Our objectives are (1) to describe the development and structure of the IMbedded Pragmatic ADRD Clinical Trials Collaboratory (IMPACT) iLibrary of potential outcome measures for ADRD pragmatic trials, and (2) to assess their pragmatic characteristics. We identified potential outcome measures from several sources: a database of administrative and clinical outcome measures from ADRD clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, published reviews, and IMPACT pilot pragmatic trial outcome measures. The iLibrary reports (a) number of items, (b) completion time, (c) readability for diverse populations, (d) cost or copyright barriers to use, (e) method of administration, (f) assessor training burden, and (g) feasibility of data capture and interpretation in routine care; a summary of pragmatic characteristics of each outcome measure (high, moderate, low); items or descriptions of items; and links to primary citations regarding development or psychometric properties. We included 140 outcome measures in the iLibrary: 66 administrative (100% were pragmatic) and 74 clinical (52% were pragmatic). The most commonly addressed outcome domains from administrative assessments included physical function, quality of care or communication concerns, and psychological symptoms or distress behaviors. The most commonly addressed outcome domains from clinical assessments were psychological symptoms or distress behaviors, physical function, cognitive function, and health-related quality of life. Pragmatic outcome measures are brief, meaningful to diverse populations, easily scored and interpreted by clinicians, and available in electronic format for analysis.

This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. An electronic search for cross-sectional, cohort, or case-control studies was conducted on five databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Scopus). No restrictions were applied to the language and year of publication. Exposure was PD, and the outcome of interest was the onset and/or progression of AD. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) designed for non-randomized studies. Six studies fulfilling the selection criteria were included in this systematic review. Four of the studies were of cohort design and two were of case-control design. All except one showed a significant association between PD and the risk of AD onset and progression. According to the NOS bias risk assessment, three studies were found to be of good quality, and three other cohort studies were of low quality. Data from this systematic review indicate that patients with PD present a significantly higher risk of AD compared to individuals with healthy periodontium.

We explored the causal link between osteocalcin and dementia via the implementation of Mendelian randomization methodology. Genome-wide association studies were employed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing significant correlations with osteocalcin. Subsequently, A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted utilizing the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) technique to assess the causal relationship between osteocalcin and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and vascular dementia (VD). This approach aimed to minimize potential sources of confounding bias and provide more robust results. Multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was conducted to adjust for potential genetic pleiotropy. The study employed three SNPs, namely rs71631868, rs9271374, and rs116843408, as genetic tools to evaluate the causal association of osteocalcin with dementia. The IVW analysis indicated that osteocalcin may have a potential protective effect against AD with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.790 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.688-0.906; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, no significant relationship was observed between osteocalcin and other types of dementia.

In this study, our objective was to explore the impact of PM2.5 on mitochondrial dynamics and neuroinflammation, while also examining the reparative potential of scorpion venom heat-resistant synthetic peptide (SVHRSP). Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were employed to ascertain the protein and gene levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in BV2 cells. The concentration of IL-6 in the supernatant of the BV2 cell culture was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For the assessment of mitochondrial homeostasis, western blot, RT-qPCR, and cellular immunohistochemistry methods were utilized to investigate the protein and gene levels of DRP1 and MFN-2 in HT22 cells. In the context of signal pathway analyses, western blot, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence techniques were employed to detect the protein and gene expressions of PGC-1\u03b1 and SIRT3 in HT22 cells, respectively. Following the transfection with siPGC-1\u03b1RNA, downstream proteins of PGC-1\u03b1/SIRT3 pathway in HT22 cells were investigated by Western blot and RT-qPCR. The experimental findings demonstrated that exposure to PM2.5 exacerbated neuroinflammation, resulting in elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, it perturbed mitochondrial dynamics, as evidenced by increased DRP1 expression and decreased MFN-2 expression. Additionally, dysfunction was observed in the PGC-1\u03b1/SIRT3 signal pathway. However, intervention with SVHRSP ameliorated the cellular damage induced by PM2.5 exposure.

        "AbstractText": "Current approaches for treating sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) focus on removal of amyloid beta 1-42 (A\u03b21-42) or phosphorylated tau, but additional strategies are needed to reduce neuropathology at earlier stages prior to neuronal damage. Longstanding data show that calcium dysregulation is a key etiological factor in sAD, and the cortical neurons most vulnerable to tau pathology show magnified calcium signaling, for example in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and entorhinal cortex (ERC). In primate dlPFC and ERC, type 3 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR3s) are predominately post-synaptic, on spines, where they regulate cAMP-calcium signaling, a process eroded by inflammatory glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) actions. The current study tested whether enhancing mGluR3 regulation of calcium via chronic inhibition of GCPII would reduce tau hyperphosphorylation in aged macaques with naturally-occurring tau pathology. Aged rhesus macaques were treated daily with the GCPII inhibitor, 2-MPPA (2-3-mercaptopropyl-penanedioic acid (2-MPPA)),Aged rhesus macaques were treated daily with the GCPII inhibitor, 2-MPPA (2-3-mercaptopropyl-penanedioic acid (2-MPPA)). Aged macaques that received 2-MPPA had significantly lower pT217Tau levels in dlPFC and ERC, and had lowered plasma pT217Tau levels from baseline. pT217Tau levels correlated significantly with GCPII activity in dlPFC. Both 2-MPPA- and vehicle-treated monkeys showed cognitive improvement; 2-MPPA had no apparent side effects. Exploratory CSF analyses indicated reduced pS202Tau with 2-MPPA administration, confirmed in dlPFC samples. These data provide proof-of-concept support that GCPII inhibition can reduce tau hyperphosphorylation in the primate cortices most vulnerable in sAD. GCPII inhibition may be particularly helpful in reducing the risk of sAD caused by inflammation. These data in nonhuman primates should encourage future research on this promising mechanism. Inflammation is a key driver of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.GCPII inflammatory signaling in brain decreases mGluR3 regulation of calcium.Chronic inhibition of GCPII inflammatory signaling reduced pT217Tau in aged monkeys.GCPII inhibition is a novel strategy to help prevent tau pathology at early stages.",

The specific role of certain NPS in functional prognosis remains unclear. To determine the association of different NPS with functional decline in people living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Lewy body dementia (LBD). This is an analysis of data from the Dementia Study of Western Norway (DemVest) with 196 patients included of which 111 had AD and 85 LBD. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Rapid Disability Rating Scale (RDRS-2) for activities of daily living were administered annually for 5 years.

The LBD group exhibited higher levels of functional impairment and a greater burden of NPS at baseline. Over the 5-year follow-up, hallucinations, aggression, depression, anxiety, apathy, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavior disturbances, and abnormal eating patterns were significantly associated with the decline in functional abilities in individuals with AD, as well as irritability and aberrant motor behavior in those with LBD. These results highlight the relevance of early detection and intervention of these particularly relevant NPS, due to its potential of also impacting physical function. Better detection and management of these NPS could improve functional prognosis in people living with dementia.

        "AbstractText": "Macroautophagy/autophagy is the intracellular degradation process of cytoplasmic content and damaged organelles. Autophagy is strongly associated with the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are brain-resident macrophages, and recent studies indicate that autophagy in microglia protects neurons from neurodegeneration. Postnatal neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons from adult neural stem cells (NSCs), is impaired in AD patients as well as in AD animal models. However, the extent to which microglial autophagy influences adult NSCs and neurogenesis in AD animal models has not been studied. Here, we showed that conditional knock out (cKO) of Atg5 (autophagy related 5) in microglia inhibited postnatal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, but not in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of a 5\u00d7FAD mouse model. Interestingly, the protection of neurogenesis by Atg5 in microglia was only observed in female AD mice. To confirm the roles of autophagy in microglia for postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, we generated additional cKO mice to delete autophagy essential genes Rb1cc1 or Atg14 in microglia. However, these rb1cc1 cKO and atg14 cKO mice did not exhibit neurogenesis defects in the context of a female AD mouse model. Last, we used the CSF1R antagonist to deplete ATG5-deficient microglia and this intervention restored neurogenesis in the hippocampus of 5\u00d7FAD mice. These results indicate that microglial ATG5 is essential to maintain postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD. Our findings further support the notion that ATG5 in microglia supports NSC health and may prevent neurodegeneration.",

We recently developed autophagy-targeting chimera (AUTOTAC), a targeted protein degradation (TPD) technology based on the macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). In this study, we employed AUTOTAC to synthesize ATC161, a chimeric compound that adopts Anle138b as target-binding ligand (TBL) for SNCA aggregates. The autophagy-targeting ligand (ATL) of ATC161 was designed to allosterically activate the autophagy receptor SQSTSM1/p62 (sequestosome 1), a key step for targeting SNCA aggregates to the phagophore. The lysosomal degradation of SNCA aggregates by ATC161 acutely occurs at DC50 of 100-500\u2009nM with no significant off-target degradation of monomeric SNCA. ATC161 protects cells from DNA and mitochondrial damage by SNCA aggregates. In PD model mice, oral administration of ATC161 decreases the level of SNCA aggregates and their propagation across brain regions, which mitigates glial inflammatory responses and improves muscle strength and locomotive activity. An Investigational New Drug (IND) was approved by the Korean Food and Drug Administration for a phase 1 clinical trial to treat PD, Alzheimer disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The structural requirements of such plasticity and molecular events involved in this regulation are poorly understood. Specific molecules, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) have been implicated in plasticity\u00a0processes in the hippocampus, a role that decreases with brain aging as expression is lost. Here, we report that TIMP2 is highly expressed by neurons within the hippocampus and its loss drives changes in cellular programs related to adult neurogenesis and dendritic spine turnover with corresponding impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory. Consistent with the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the hippocampus we observe with aging, we find that TIMP2 acts to reduce accumulation of ECM around synapses in the hippocampus. Moreover, its deletion results in hindrance of newborn neuron migration through a denser ECM network. A novel conditional TIMP2 knockout (KO) model reveals that neuronal TIMP2 regulates adult neurogenesis, accumulation of ECM, and ultimately hippocampus-dependent memory. Our results define a mechanism whereby hippocampus-dependent function is regulated by TIMP2 and its interactions with the ECM to regulate diverse processes associated with synaptic plasticity.",

        "AbstractText": "Isoflavones and their derivatives possess neuroprotective activities against neurological disorders. Recently, the active compound SPA1413 (dehydroequol) derived from S-equol, an isoflavone-derived metabolite produced by human intestinal bacteria, was identified as a potent anti-amyloidogenic and neuroinflammatory candidate against Alzheimer's disease. However, its detailed modes of action, associated signaling pathways, and comparison with potential isoflavone derivatives have not yet been studied. Hence, the current study aimed to identify signaling pathways associated with SPA1413 using lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated BV2 cells as the experimental model via biological assays, Western blotting, and quantitative (q)RT-PCR. The results indicate that the SPA1413 anti-neuroinflammatory effect arises due to suppression of the nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling networks, including those of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Interestingly, SPA1413 inhibited IL-11 through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. In addition, SPA1413 inhibited neuronal cell death by reducing LPS-activated microglia in neuronal N2a cells. Our findings suggest that SPA1413 may act as a strong anti-neuroinflammatory candidate by suppressing the MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways.",

Its efficacy has been shown in protecting neural cells in vitro and improving the morphology of the cell population in the brain of mice with AD pathology (AD mice). Matrine (Mat) is a natural product capable of binding to A\u03b242 or its aggregates and blocking their neurotoxicity at concentrations of at least 10\u00a0\u03bcM or greater. However, this study revealed a synergistic effect of Mat on the catalytic effect of HS72 at low concentrations (0.01-2.5\u00a0\u03bcM). This is evidenced by the fact that Mat synergistically enhances HS72's ability to degrade A\u03b242 aggregates and protect neural cells (SH-SY5Y and HT22\u00a0cells, and brain cells of AD mice). The molecular docking models and characterization of Mat's action both indicated that the mechanism of Mat's synergistic impact on HS72 catalysis is to increase the turnover number (or molecular activity) of HS72 by enhancing the catalytic power of the HS72's catalytic groups and encouraging the release of the degradation products (A\u03b2 fragments). The study's results suggest a natural synergy between Mat-like small molecules and the catalytic anti-oligomeric A\u03b242 antibody HS72, enabling more effective reduction or removal of A\u03b242 aggregates or plaques than the antibody alone. These findings provide novel insights into the effectiveness of anti-oligomeric A\u03b242 antibodies in AD immunotherapy.",

Aberrant amyloid-beta accumulation is a common pathological feature in AD patients. Dysfunction of autophagy and impairment of \u03b17nAChR functioning are associated with enhanced amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) accumulation in AD patients. Hesperidin, a flavone glycoside found primarily in citrus species, is known to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of hesperidin as an antiaging and anti-A\u03b2 phytochemical were unclear. In this study, we found that hesperidin upregulates the acr-16 expression level in C. elegans as evidenced by increased GFP-tagged ACR-16 and GFP-tagged pmyo-3:ACR-16 expression in muscle and ventral cord. Further, hesperidin upregulates the autophagy genes in wild-type N2, evident by increased GFP-tagged LGG-1 foci. However, hesperidin failed to upregulate the autophagy genes level in acr-16 mutant worms that suggests autophagy activation is mediated through acr-16. In addition, hesperidin showed antiaging and anti-oxidative effects, as evidenced by positive changes in different markers necessary for health span and lifespan. Additionally, hesperidin could upregulate acr-16 and autophagy genes (lgg-1 & bec-1) and ameliorates A\u03b2-induced toxicity as observed with reduce ROS accumulation, paralysis rate, and enhanced lifespan even in worms AD model CL4176 and CL2006 strain. Our finding suggests that hesperidin significantly enhances oxidative stress resistance, prolongs the lifespan, and protects against A\u03b2-induced toxicity in C. elegans. acr-16 mediated autophagy and antioxidation is associated with anti-aging and anti-A\u03b2 effect of hesperidin.",

Specifically, these models are apt to prospective studies in which causative mechanisms can be manipulated via multiple tools (e.g., genetically engineered models and environmental interventions), and experimentally dissociated to control for potential confounding factors. Here, we provide a narrative synthesis of preclinical studies investigating the association between hyperglycaemia - as a proxy of insulin-related metabolic dysfunctions - and impairments in working and spatial memory, and attention.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is a cognitive dysfunction caused by brain blood flow damage and one of the most common causes of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. White matter damage in patients with chronic ischemic dementia often occurs before cognitive impairment, and its pathological changes include leukoaraiosis, myelin destruction and oligodendrocyte death. The pathophysiology of vascular dementia is complex, involving a variety of neuronal and vascular lesions. The current proposed mechanisms include calcium overload, oxidative stress, nitrative stress and inflammatory damage, which can lead to hypoxia-ischemia and demyelination. Oligodendrocytes are the only myelinating cells in the central nervous system and closely associated with VaD. In this review article, we intend to further discuss the role of oligodendrocytes in white matter and myelin injury in VaD and the development of anti-myelin injury target drugs.",

Here, we summarize existing knowledge on the relationship between brain structural and functional measures and olfaction in older adults without and with cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's disease. We identified 33 eligible studies (30 MRI/DTI,3 fMRI); 31 were cross-sectional, most assessed odor identification, and few examined multiple brain areas. Lower olfactory function was associated with smaller volumes in the temporal lobe (hippocampus,parahippocampal gyrus,fusiform gyrus), olfactory-related regions (piriform cortex,amygdala,entorhinal cortex), pre- and postcentral gyri, and globus pallidus. During aging, olfactory impairment may be associated with pathology in brain areas important for motor function and cognition, especially memory.

We performed confounder-adjusted linear regression analyses between neuroimaging scores and both continuous serologies and categorical seropositivity of each pathogen, as well as a combined infectious burden index (IBI). We identified that increased serologic titers of herpes simplex virus 2 were associated with reduced whole-brain cortical thickness, and a combined score of HSV-2 and C. pneumoniae displayed an additive effect on reduced cortical thickness.

The Chow test was used to quantify sex differences by determining if biological sex affects relationships between the studied biomarkers and outcomes. Multiple magnetic resonance imaging (whole brain, entorhinal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, hippocampus), position emission tomography (AV45), and CSF (P-TAU, TAU) biomarkers were differentially associated with cognitive and functional outcomes. Post-hoc bootstrapped and association analyses confirmed these differential effects and emphasized the necessity of using separate, sex-stratified models.

Herein, we aimed to investigate whether the neuroprotective effect of SalB is attributable to the modulation of microglial polarization and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation. Based on the TMT-labeled proteomics analysis, immunofluorescence, western blot and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were employed to investigate the effects of SalB on neuroinflammation in A\u03b21-42-stimulated BV2 microglia cells. At the proteomic level, a total of 6631 proteins were quantified, and of these, 104 were significantly influenced under A\u03b21-42 treatment. The expression of 36 A\u03b21-42-induced differentially expressed proteins were significantly recovered by SalB treatment (13 upregulated and 23 downregulated). NLRP3 was significantly recovered and was identified as one of the hub proteins. Consistent with the result of the proteomic analysis, western blot and qRT-PCR demonstrated that SalB reduced A\u03b21-42-induced NLRP3 upregulation at both the protein and mRNA levels. In addition, SalB significantly blocked M1 microglia polarization, enhanced M2 microglial polarization, and inhibited the production of caspase-1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 in BV2 microglia cells. our study demonstrated, for the first time, that the anti-inflammatory effects of SalB were mediated by the regulation of NLRP3 activation and promotion of microglial M2 polarization, indicating the potential of SalB as a novel therapeutic candidate for AD.",

In vitro inhibitory effect against Electrophorus electricus acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) from Equine serum was evaluated using modified Ellman's method, considering donepezil and tacrine as reference drugs. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis of the results proved competitive inhibition of AChE and BChE with Ki values, in low micromolar range. The free carboxylic acid series 4a-g showed enhanced selectivity for AChE. Hence, 4c, 1,4-bis (4-chlorobenzyl)-piperazinyl-2-carboxylic acid), was the most active member of this series (Ki (AChE)\u00a0=\u00a010.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.00\u00a0\u00b5M) with clear selectivity for AChE (SI\u00a0\u223c\u00a017.90).

Extraordinarily, 1,4-bis (2-chlorobenzyl)-piperazinyl-2-hydroxamic acid 7b showed promising inhibitory activity against BChE enzyme (Ki\u00a0=\u00a01.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0nM, SI\u00a0=\u00a021862.5), that was significantly superior to that elicited by donepezil (Ki\u00a0=\u00a012.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0\u00b5M) and tacrine (Ki\u00a0=\u00a017.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0nM). Cytotoxicity assessment of 4c and 7b, on human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines, revealed lower toxicity than staurosporine and was nearly comparable to that of donepezil. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation afforded unblemished insights into the structure-activity relationships for AChE and BChE inhibition. The results showed stable binding with fair H-bonding, hydrophobic and/or ionic interactions to the catalytic and peripheral anionic sites of the enzymes. In silico predicted ADME and physicochemical properties of conjugates showed good CNS bioavailability and safety parameters. In this regard, compound (7b) might be considered as a promising inhibitor of BChE with an innovative donepezil-based anti-Alzheimer activity. Further assessments of the most potent AChE and BChE inhibitors as potential MTDLs anti-Alzheimer's agents are under investigation with our research group and will be published later.",

The neuroprotective and memory improving effects of isolated compound were evaluated by aluminium chloride induced Alzheimer's disease rat model, elevated plus maze (EPM) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests., Levels of dopamine and serotonin in rats brains were determined using HPLC. Moreover, western blot and docking were performed to determine interaction between berberine and \u03b2-secretase. During fractionation, ethyl acetate and methanol (3:7) fraction was collected from solvent mixture of ethyl acetate and methanol. This fraction showed the highest anti-acetylcholinesterase activity and was alkaloid positive. The results of TLC and HPLC analysis indicated the presence of the isolated compound as berberine. Additionally, the confirmation of isolated compound as berberine was carried out using FTIR and NMR analysis. In vivo EPM and MWM tests showed improved memory patterns after berberine treatment in Alzheimer's disease model. The levels of dopamine, serotonin and activity of antioxidant enzymes were significantly (p<0.05) enhanced in brain tissue homogenates of berberine treated group. This was supported by decreased expression of \u03b2-secretase in berberine treated rat brain homogenates and good binding affinity of berberine with \u03b2-secretase in docking studies. Binding energies for interaction of \u03b2-secretase with berberine and drug Rivastigmine is -7.0 kcal/mol and -5.8 kcal/mol respectively representing the strong interactions.

Surprisingly, a third (33%, 3379/10263) of hippocampal -dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1 and subiculum- neurons showed movie-selectivity, with elevated firing in specific movie sub-segments, termed movie-fields, similar to the vast majority of thalamo-cortical (LGN, V1, AM-PM) neurons (97%, 6554/6785).

Yet, the total duration of all the movie-fields of a cell was comparable across neurons and brain regions. The hippocampal responses thus showed greater continuous-sequence encoding than visual areas, as evidenced by fewer and broader movie-fields than in visual areas. Consistently, repeated presentation of the movie images in a fixed, but scrambled sequence virtually abolished hippocampal but not visual-cortical selectivity. The preference for continuous, compared to scrambled sequence was eight-fold greater in hippocampal than visual areas, further supporting episodic-sequence encoding.

TAVI may have negative cognitive effects due to periprocedural micro-emboli inducing cerebral infarction. On the contrary, TAVI may also have positive cognitive effects due to increases in cardiac output and cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, studies that systematically assess these effects are scarce. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to assess cerebral and cognitive outcomes in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing TAVI. In the prospective CAPITA (CArdiac OutPut, Cerebral Blood Flow and Cognition In Patients With Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) study, cerebral and cognitive outcomes are assessed in patients undergoing TAVI. One day before and 3\u00a0months after TAVI, patients will undergo echocardiography (cardiac output, valve function), brain magnetic resonance imaging (CBF, structural lesions) and extensive neuropsychological assessment. To assess longer-term effects of TAVI, patients will again undergo echocardiography and neuropsychological assessment 1\u00a0year after the procedure.

The start-up duration in the smooth pursuit test and the number of offsets in the central fixation test were identified as the diagnostic eye movement parameters for D-AD patients with the area under the ROC curves of 0.8011. Partial correlation analysis revealed that the start-up duration and pursuit velocity in the smooth pursuit test and the total offset degrees in the lateral fixation test were correlated with HAMD-17 scores in D-AD patients. Eye movement differences may help to differentiate D-AD patients from nD-AD patients in a non-invasive and cost-effective manner.",

        "AbstractText": "Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. This neurodegenerative disease is characterized by progressive and irreversible damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerves, which can lead to permanent loss of peripheral and central vision. To date, maintaining long-term survival of RGCs using traditional treatments, such as medication and surgery, remains challenging, as these do not promote optic nerve regeneration. Therefore, it is of great clinical and social significance to investigate the mechanisms of optic nerve degeneration in depth and find reliable targets to provide pioneering methods for the prevention and treatment of glaucoma. Regulated necrosis is a form of genetically programmed cell death associated with the maintenance of homeostasis and disease progression in vivo. An increasing body of innovative evidence has recognized that aberrant activation of regulated necrosis pathways is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and glaucoma, resulting in unwanted loss of neuronal cells and function. Among them, ferroptosis and pyroptosis are newly discovered forms of regulated cell death actively involved in the pathophysiological processes of RGCs loss and optic nerve injury. This was shown by a series of in vivo and in vitro studies, and these mechanisms have been emerging as a key new area of scientific research in ophthalmic diseases. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and pyroptosis and their regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, with the aim of exploring their implications as potential therapeutic targets and providing new perspectives for better clinical decision-making in glaucoma treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Despite advances toward understanding the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it remains unclear which aspects of this disease are affected by environmental factors. Chronic life stress increases risk for aging-related diseases including AD. The impact of stress on tauopathies remains understudied. We examined the effects of stress elicited by social (chronic subordination stress, CSS) or psychological/physical (chronic restraint stress, CRS) factors - on the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy. Male PS19 mice (average age 6.3 months) were randomized to receive CSS, CRS, or to remain as singly-housed controls. Behavioral tests were used to assess anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive functions. Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting analysis were used to measure levels of astrogliosis, microgliosis and tau burden. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess glucocorticoid receptor expression. PS19 mice exhibit neuroinflammation (GFAP, t-tests; p = 0.0297; Iba1, t-tests; p = 0.006) and tau hyperphosphorylation (t-test, p = 0.0446) in the hippocampus, reduced anxiety (post hoc, p = 0.046), and cognitive deficits, when compared to wild type mice. Surprisingly, CRS reduced hippocampal levels of both total tau and phospho-tauS404 (t-test, p = 0.0116), and attenuated some aspects of both astrogliosis and microgliosis in PS19 mice (t-tests, p = 0.068 to p = 0.0003); however, this was not associated with significant changes in neurodegeneration or cognitive function. Anxiety-like behaviors were increased by CRS (post hoc, p = 0.046). Conversely, CSS impaired spatial learning in Barnes Maze without impacting tau phosphorylation or neurodegeneration and having a minimal impact on gliosis. Our results demonstrate that social or psychological stress can differentially impact anxiety-like behavior, select cognitive functions, and some aspects of tau-dependent pathology in PS19 male mice, providing entry points for the development of experimental approaches designed to slow AD progression.",

        "AbstractText": "A progressive aggregation of misfolded proteins is a hallmark of numerous pathologies including diabetes Type 2, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. As a result, highly toxic protein aggregates, which are known as amyloid fibrils, are formed. A growing body of evidence suggests that phospholipids can uniquely alter the secondary structure and toxicity of amyloid aggregates. However, the role of phosphatidic acid (PA), a unique lipid that is responsible for cell signaling and activation of lipid-gated ion channels, in the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of the length and degree of unsaturation of fatty acids (FAs) in PA in the structure and toxicity of lysozyme fibrils formed in the presence of this lipid. We found that both the length and saturation of FAs in PA uniquely altered the secondary structure of lysozyme fibrils. However, these structural differences in PA caused very little if any changes in the morphology of lysozyme fibrils. We also utilized cell toxicity assays to determine the extent to which the length and degree of unsaturation of FAs in PA altered the toxicity of lysozyme fibrils. We found that amyloid fibrils formed in the presence of PA with C18:0 FAs exerted significantly higher cell toxicity compared to the aggregates formed in the presence of PA with C16:0 and C18:1 FAs. These results demonstrated that PA can be an important player in the onset and spread of amyloidogenic diseases.",

This study focused on sleep impairment as an overt clinical symptom and tauopathy as a prominent molecular symptom of this disease. Multiple compounds from three biomolecule libraries (719 compounds; ChemDiv:366 - ChEMBL:180 - PubChem:173) were evaluated for potential binding affinity and safety using AutoDock Vina and pkCSM, respectively, resulting in the selection of four candidate compounds (Lestaurtinib, Repotrectinib, Bemcentinib, and Zotiraciclib). Due to the similarity of Repotrectinib and Bemcentinib binding sites to ATP, 300\u2009ns Martini 3 coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) was performed on these two molecules and ATP by NAMD. The stability of tau protein in the presence of drugs was assessed using a 200\u2009ns Martini 3 MD simulation. Binding site analysis discloses Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib as two inhibitors occupying most amino acids in binding with ATP. The RMSD and RMS average correlation results revealed protein containing Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib to have a more stable state compared to ATP in the first 220\u2009ns simulation. There was only a single detachment of Bemcentinib, while Repotrictinib detached twice at the end of the simulation. Eventually, adding Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib to the enzyme-tau complex significantly increased the number of tau detachments during the 200\u2009ns simulation. We report Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib, formerly prescribed for cancer, as potential inhibitors of the CK1 \u03b4. Besides their high binding affinity compared to ATP, they can inhibit all ATP-binding sites and alter the tau binding stability.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "AbstractText": "Brain disorders comprise several psychiatric and neurological disorders which can be characterized by impaired cognition, mood alteration, psychosis, depressive episodes, and neurodegeneration. Clinical diagnoses primarily rely on a combination of life history information and questionnaires, with a distinct lack of discriminative biomarkers in use for psychiatric disorders. Symptoms across brain conditions are associated with functional alterations of cognitive and emotional processes, which can correlate with anatomical variation; structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the brain are therefore an important focus of research, particularly for predictive modelling. With the advent of large MRI data consortia (such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) facilitating a greater number of MRI-based classification studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-deep learning models well suited to image processing tasks-have become increasingly popular for research into brain conditions. This has resulted in a myriad of studies reporting impressive predictive performances, demonstrating the potential clinical value of deep learning systems. However, methodologies can vary widely across studies, making them difficult to compare and/or reproduce,\u00a0potentially limiting their clinical application. Here, we conduct a qualitative systematic literature review of 55 studies carrying out CNN-based predictive modelling of brain disorders using MRI data and evaluate them based on three principles-modelling practices, transparency, and interpretability.

        "AbstractText": "White matter abnormalities, related to poor cerebral perfusion, are a core feature of small vessel cerebrovascular disease, and critical determinants of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Despite this importance there is a lack of treatment options. Proliferation of microglia producing an expanded, reactive population and associated neuroinflammatory alterations have been implicated in the onset and progression of cerebrovascular white matter disease, in patients and in animal models, suggesting that targeting microglial proliferation may exert protection. Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) is a key regulator of microglial proliferation. We found that the expression of CSF1R/Csf1r and other markers indicative of increased microglial abundance are significantly elevated in damaged white matter in human cerebrovascular disease and in a clinically relevant mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular cognitive impairment. Using the mouse model, we investigated long-term pharmacological CSF1R inhibition, via GW2580, and demonstrated that the expansion of microglial numbers in chronic hypoperfused white matter is prevented. Transcriptomic analysis of hypoperfused white matter tissue showed enrichment of microglial and inflammatory gene sets, including phagocytic genes that were the predominant expression modules modified by CSF1R inhibition. Further, CSF1R inhibition attenuated hypoperfusion-induced white matter pathology and rescued spatial learning impairments and to a lesser extent cognitive flexibility. Overall, this work suggests that inhibition of CSF1R and microglial proliferation mediates protection against chronic cerebrovascular white matter pathology and cognitive deficits. Our study nominates CSF1R as a target for the treatment of vascular cognitive disorders with broader implications for treatment of other chronic white matter diseases.",

A substantial body of evidence suggests the role of exosomal noncoding ribonucleic acids in the development of Alzheimer's disease, but the regulatory mechanisms mediated by these noncoding ribonucleic acids remain extensively unknown. Using plasma samples from Alzheimer's disease patients, this study explored the exosomal circular ribonucleic acid-microribonucleic acid profiles. The ArrayExpress platform was used to convey data from 3 samples from each group (healthy, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease). Using plasma exosomes, differentially expressed microribonucleic acids and differentially expressed circular ribonucleic acids were compared between the Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment groups. Afterward, to define pathways, gene ontologies, and networks, differentially expressed microribonucleic acids and differentially expressed circular ribonucleic acids common to both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups were analyzed. Eventually, the selection of hub genes and protein-protein interaction network was analyzed. A total of common 19 (7 upregulated and 12 downregulated) differentially expressed microribonucleic acids and 24 differentially expressed circular ribonucleic acids were recognized. A total of 4559 target genes were predicted for upregulated differentially expressed microribonucleic acids, while 6504 target genes were identified for downregulated differentially expressed microribonucleic acids, and most of the target genes involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinases-Akt pathway and that were mostly regulated by hsa-mir-374a-3p, mir-196a-5p, let-205-5p, mir-185-3p, mir-374a-5p, mir-615-3p, let-7c-5p, mir-185-5p.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical cognitive disorder with an increasing incidence in recent years. AD is also one of the main causes of disability and death of the elderly in current aging society. One of the most common symptoms of AD is spatial memory impairment, which occurs in more than 60% of patients. This memory loss is closely related to the impairment of cognitive maps in the brain. The entorhinal grid cells and the hippocampal place cells are important cellular basis for spatial memory and navigation functions in the brain. Understanding the abnormal firing pattern of these neurons and their impaired coordination to neural oscillations in transgenic rodents is crucial for identifying the therapeutic targets for AD. In this article, we review recent studies on neural activity based on transgenic rodent models of AD, with a focus on the changes in the firing characteristics of neurons and the abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. We also discuss potential cell-network mechanism of spatial memory disorders caused by AD, so as to provide a scientific basis for the diagnosis and treatment of AD in the future.",

The pathogenesis of AD is still uncertain and intricate, and helpful therapy has rarely been recorded. So, discovering amyloid modulators is deemed a promising avenue for preventing and treating AD. In this study, human serum albumin (HSA), a protein-based A\u03b2 inhibitor, was utilized as a template to guide the synthesis of HSA-manganese dioxide nanocomposites (HMn NCs) through biomineralization. The in situ formed MnO2 in HSA endows this nano-platform with outstanding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability, including superoxide dismutase-mimetic and catalase-mimetic activities, which could scavenge the plethora of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide. More importantly, the HMn NCs show enhanced potency in suppressing A\u03b2 fibrillization compared with HSA, which further alleviates A\u03b2-mediated SH-SY5Y neurotoxicity by scavenging excessive ROS. Moreover, it is demonstrated that HMn NCs reduce A\u03b2-related inflammation in BV-2 cells by lowering tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6. Furthermore, transgenic C. elegans studies showed that HMn NCs could remove A\u03b2 plaques, reduce ROS in CL2006 worms, and promote the lifespan extension of worms.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated a mouse model with expression of mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) in only hippocampal CA3 cells. We found that performance in a hippocampus-dependent memory task was impaired in young adult and aged mutant mice. In both age groups, we then recorded from the CA1 region, which receives inputs from APP-expressing CA3 cells. We observed that theta oscillation frequency in CA1 was reduced along with disrupted relative timing of principal cells. Highly localized pathology limited to the presynaptic CA3 cells is thus sufficient to cause aberrant firing patterns in postsynaptic neuronal networks, which indicates that disease progression is not only from spreading pathology but also mediated by progressively advancing physiological dysfunction.",

These 26 dementia-related metabolites were subfractions of intermediate-density lipoprotein, large low-density lipoprotein (L-LDL), small high-density lipoprotein (S-HDL), very-low-density lipoprotein, fatty acids, ketone bodies, citrate, glucose, and valine. Among them, the cholesterol percentage in L-LDL (L-LDL-C%) was associated with lower risk of AD (HR [95% CI]\u2009=\u20090.92 [0.87-0.97], p\u2009=\u20090.002), higher brain cortical (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.047, p\u2009=\u20093.91\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6 ), and hippocampal (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.043, p\u2009=\u20091.93\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4 ) volume. Cholesteryl ester-to-total lipid ratio in L-LDL (L-LDL-CE%) was associated with lower risk of AD (HR [95% CI]\u2009=\u20090.93 [0.90-0.96], p\u2009=\u20091.48\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4 ), cognitive deficits (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.98, p\u2009=\u20090.009), and higher hippocampal volume (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.027, p\u2009=\u20090.009). Cholesteryl esters in S-HDL (S-HDL-CE) were associated with lower risk of VD (HR [95% CI]\u2009=\u20090.81 [0.71-0.93], p\u2009=\u20090.002), but not AD. Taken together, circulating levels of L-LDL-CE% and L-LDL-C% were robustly associated with risk of AD and AD phenotypes, but not with VD. S-HDL-CE was associated with lower risk of VD, but not with AD or AD phenotypes. These metabolites may play a role in the advancement of future intervention trials. Additional research is necessary to gain a complete comprehension of the molecular mechanisms behind these associations.",

        "AbstractText": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in the regulation of brain health and disease. Microglia perform multiple functions in the central nervous system, including surveillance, phagocytosis and release of a variety of soluble factors. Importantly, a majority of their functions are closely related to changes in their metabolism. This natural inter-dependency between core microglial properties and metabolism offers a unique opportunity to modulate microglial activities via nutritional or metabolic interventions. In this review, we examine the existing scientific literature to synthesize the hypothesis that microglial phagocytosis of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) aggregates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be selectively enhanced via metabolic interventions. We first review the basics of microglial metabolism and the effects of common metabolites, such as glucose, lipids, ketone bodies, glutamine, pyruvate and lactate, on microglial inflammatory and phagocytic properties. Next, we examine the evidence for dysregulation of microglial metabolism in AD. This is followed by a review of in vivo studies on metabolic manipulation of microglial functions to ascertain their therapeutic potential in AD. Finally, we discuss the effects of metabolic factors on microglial phagocytosis of healthy synapses, a pathological process that also contributes to the progression of AD. We conclude by enlisting the current challenges that need to be addressed before strategies to harness microglial phagocytosis to clear pathological protein deposits in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders can be widely adopted.",

        "AbstractText": "The function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is impaired in late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), but the associated molecular mechanisms, particularly with respect to the high-risk APOE4/4 genotype, are not well understood. For this purpose, we developed a multicellular isogenic model of the neurovascular unit (NVU) based on human induced pluripotent stem cells. The human NVU was modeled in vitro using isogenic co-cultures of astrocytes, brain capillary endothelial-like cells (BCECs), microglia-like cells, neural stem cells (NSCs), and pericytes. Physiological and pathophysiological properties were investigated as well as the influence of each single cell type on the characteristics and function of BCECs. The barriers established by BCECs were analyzed for specific gene transcription using high-throughput quantitative PCR. Co-cultures were found to tighten the barrier of BCECs and alter its transcriptomic profile under both healthy and disease conditions. In vitro differentiation of brain cell types that constitute the NVU was not affected by the LOAD background. The supportive effect of NSCs on the barrier established by BCECs was diminished under LOAD conditions. Transcriptomes of LOAD BCECs were modulated by different brain cell types. NSCs were found to have the strongest effect on BCEC gene regulation and maintenance of the BBB. Co-cultures showed cell type-specific functional contributions to BBB integrity under healthy and LOAD conditions. Cell type-dependent transcriptional effects on LOAD BCECs were identified. Our study suggests that different brain cell types of the NVU have unique roles in maintaining barrier integrity that vary under healthy and LOAD conditions. .",

        "AbstractText": "With the increase in the aging population, informal caregivers have become an essential pillar for the long-term care of older individuals. However, providing care can have a negative impact and increase the burden on caregivers, which is a cause for concern. This study aimed to comprehensively depict the concept of \"informal caregiver burden\" through bibliometric and content analyses. We searched the Web of Science (WoS) database to obtain bibliometric data and included only papers published between 2013 and 2022. We used content analysis to extract and identify the core concepts within the text systematically. Altogether, 934 papers were included in the bibliometric analysis, from which we selected 19 highly impactful papers for content analysis. The results indicate that researchers have focused on exploring the factors that impact informal caregiver burden. Meanwhile, there has been a widespread discussion regarding the caregiver burden among those caring for recipients with specific illnesses, such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, as these illnesses can contribute to varying levels of burden on informal caregivers. In addition, questionnaires and interviews emerged as the predominant methods for data collection in the realm of informal caregiver research. Furthermore, we identified 26 distinct assessment tools specifically tailored for evaluating burden, such as caregiver strain index (CSI). For future studies, we suggest considering the intersectionality of factors contributing to the burden on informal caregivers. This approach could enhance the well-being of both caregivers and older care recipients.",

Amyloid precursor protein (App) knock-in mouse models recapitulate AD-associated A\u03b2 pathology, allowing elucidation of downstream effects of A\u03b2 accumulation and their temporal appearance upon disease progression. Here we have investigated the sequential onset of AD-like pathologies in AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F knock-in mice by time-course transcriptome analysis of hippocampus, a region severely affected in AD. Strikingly, energy metabolism emerged as one of the most significantly altered pathways already at an early stage of pathology. Functional experiments in isolated mitochondria from hippocampus of both AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F mice confirmed an upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation driven by the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, IV and V, associated with higher susceptibility to oxidative damage and Ca2+-overload. Upon increasing pathologies, the brain shifts to a state of hypometabolism with reduced abundancy of mitochondria in presynaptic terminals. These late-stage mice also displayed enlarged presynaptic areas associated with abnormal accumulation of synaptic vesicles and autophagosomes, the latter ultimately leading to local autophagy impairment in the synapses. In summary, we report that A\u03b2-induced pathways in App knock-in mouse models recapitulate key pathologies observed in AD brain, and our data herein adds a comprehensive understanding of the pathologies including dysregulated metabolism and synapses and their timewise appearance to find new therapeutic approaches for AD.",

It is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs). Although PD is primarily considered a gray matter (GM) disease, alterations in white matter (WM) have gained increasing attention in PD research recently. Here we review evidence collected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques which indicate WM abnormalities in PD, and discuss the correlations between WM changes and specific PD symptoms. Then we summarize transcriptome and genome studies showing the changes of oligodendrocyte (OLs)/myelin in PD. We conclude that WM abnormalities caused by the changes of myelin/OLs might be important for PD pathology, which could be potential targets for PD treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein accumulation in the brain. Passive immunotherapies using monoclonal antibodies for targeting A\u03b2 have shown promise for AD treatment. Indeed, recent US FDA approval of aducanumab and lecanemab, alongside positive donanemab Phase III results demonstrated clinical efficacy after decades of failed clinical trials for AD. However, the pharmacological basis distinguishing clinically effective from ineffective therapies remains unclear, impeding development of potent therapeutics. This study aimed to provide a quantitative perspective for effectively targeting A\u03b2 with antibodies. We first reviewed the contradicting results associated with amyloid hypothesis and the pharmacological basis of A\u03b2 immunotherapy. Subsequently, we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model that describes the non-linear progression of A\u03b2 pathology and the pharmacologic actions of the A\u03b2-targeting antibodies. Using the QSP model, we analyzed various scenarios for effective passive immunotherapy for AD. The model revealed that binding exclusively to the A\u03b2 monomer has minimal effect on A\u03b2 aggregation and plaque reduction, therefore antibody affinity towards A\u03b2 monomer is unwanted, as it could become a distractive mechanism for plaque reduction. Neither early intervention, high brain penetration, nor increased dose alone could yield significant improvement of clinical efficacy for antibodies targeting solely monomers. Antibodies that bind all A\u03b2 species but lack effector function exhibited moderate effects in plaque reduction. Our model highlights the importance of binding aggregate A\u03b2 species and incorporating effector functions for efficient and early plaque reduction, guiding the development of more effective therapies for this devastating disease. Significance Statement Despite previous unsuccessful attempts spanning several decades, passive immunotherapies utilizing monoclonal antibodies for targeting amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) have demonstrated promise with two recent FDA approvals. However, the pharmacological basis that differentiates clinically effective therapies from ineffective ones remains elusive. Our study offers a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) perspective, emphasizing the significance of selectively targeting specific A\u03b2 species and importance of antibody effector functions. This perspective sheds light on the development of more effective therapies for this devastating disease.",

Two brain CSF clearance measures (vCSF and DTI-ALPS) were derived from dynamic PET and MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for 50 subjects, 24/50 were A\u03b2 positive (A\u03b2+). T1W, T2W, DTI, T2FLAIR, and 11C-PiB and 18F-MK-6240 PET were acquired. Multivariate linear regression models were assessed with both vCSF and DTI-ALPS as independent variables and brain A\u03b2 as the dependent variable. Three types of models were evaluated, including the vCSF-only model, the ALPS-only model and the vCSF+ALPS combined model. Models were applied to the whole group, and A\u03b2 subgroups. All analyses were controlled for age, gender, and intracranial volume. Sample demographics (N=50) include 20 males and 30 females with a mean age of 69.30 (sd=8.55). Our results show that the combination of vCSF and ALPS associates with A\u03b2 deposition (p < 0.05, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.575) better than either vCSF (p < 0.05, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.431) or ALPS (p < 0.05, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.372) alone in the A\u03b2+ group. We observed similar results in whole-group analyses (combined model: p < 0.05, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.287; vCSF model: p <0.05, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.175; ALPS model: p < 0.05, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.196) with less significance. Our data also showed that vCSF has higher correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.548) in subjects with mild A\u03b2\u00a0deposition and DTI-ALPS has higher correlation (r=-0.451) with severe A\u03b2\u00a0deposition subjects. The regression model with both vCSF and DTI-ALPS is better associated with brain A\u03b2 deposition. These two independent brain clearance measures may better explain the variation in A\u03b2 deposition than either term individually.

Elevated IL-6 levels have been observed in neuroinflammatory conditions, as well as in the sera and brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Multiple Sclerosis, and Alzheimer's. Additionally, alterations in regional brain pH have been noted in these conditions. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), including ASIC1a, activated by low pH levels, are highly abundant in the CNS and have recently been associated with various neurological disorders. Our study examined the impact of IL-6 on ASIC1a channels in cell cultures, demonstrating IL-6-induced the redistribution of cytosolic ASIC1a channels to the cell membrane. This redistribution was accompanied by increased ASIC1a current amplitude upon activation, as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated CaMKII and ERK kinases. Additionally, we observed posttranslational modifications on the ASIC1a channel itself. These findings provide insight into a potential link between inflammatory processes and neurodegenerative mechanisms, highlighting ASIC1a channels as promising therapeutic targets in these conditions.",

Brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and others are considered neurodegenerative diseases and can be characterized by progressive loss of neurons. The deficiency of insulin, impaired signaling, and its resistance lead to alteration in the neuronal functioning of the brain. Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a significant role in the amyloid \u03b2 metabolism, aggregation, and deposition of misfolded proteins in the brain's hippocampal and cortical neuronal regions. The insulin signaling via IP3 activation upregulates the IDE and could be a promising approach to regulate neurodegeneration. The repurposing of existing antidiabetic drugs such as Metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1), sodium-glucose co-transport-2 (SGCT-2) inhibitors, and insulin could be an alternative and effective strategy to treat neurodegeneration via modulating insulin signaling, insulin resistance, IDE activity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, serum lipid profile and neuroinflammation in the brain. Antidiabetic medications reduce the risk of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and A\u03b2 deposition by enhancing their clearance rate. The downregulation of IDE alters the degradation of A\u03b2 monomers in the Tg2576 APP mice. Also, the treatment with metformin activated the AMPK pathway and suppressed mTOR and BACE-1 protein expression in the APP/PS1-induced mice model. Thus, the primary intention of this review is to explore the link between T2DM and neurodegenerative disorders, and the possible role of various antidiabetic drugs in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.",

Extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide deposition and secondary persistent inflammation due to activation of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrated immune cells contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neurodegeneration. The majority of evidence supports the neuroprotective effects of Treg cells in AD. In the early stages of AD, appropriate Treg cell activity is required for the induction of microglia and astrocyte phagocytic activity in order to clear A deposits and prevent neuroinflammation. Such neuroprotective impacts were in part attributed to the ability of Treg cells to suppress deleterious and/or boost beneficial functions of microglia/astrocytes. In the later stages of AD, an effective Treg cell activity needs to prevent neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Treg cells can exert preventive effects on Th1-, and Th17 cell-related pathologic responses, whilst potentiating Th2-mediated protective activity.

Curcumin is a small polyphenolic molecule that provides an interesting opportunity to understand the fundamental mechanisms of membrane-mediated aggregation because it embeds into membranes to alter their structure while also altering A\u03b2 aggregation in an aqueous environment. The purpose of this work was to understand interactions among curcumin, \u03b2-sheet-rich A\u03b2 fibrillar oligomers (FO), and a model anionic membrane. From a combination of liquid surface X-ray scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we found that curcumin embedded into an anionic 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylglycerol (DMPG) membrane to rest between the lipid headgroups and the tails, causing disorder and membrane thinning. FO accumulation on the membrane was reduced by \u223c66% in the presence of curcumin, likely influenced by membrane thinning. Simulation results suggested curcumin clusters near exposed phenylalanine residues on a membrane-embedded FO structure. Altogether, curcumin inhibited FO interactions with a DMPG membrane, likely through a combination of altered membrane structure and interactions with the FO surface. This work elucidates the mechanism of curcumin as a small molecule that inhibits amyloidogenesis through a combination of both membrane and protein interactions.",

        "AbstractText": "The aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide and tau protein dysregulation are implicated to play key roles in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and are considered the main pathological hallmarks of this devastating disease. Physiologically, these two proteins are produced and expressed within the normal human body. However, under pathological conditions, abnormal expression, post-translational modifications, conformational changes, and truncation can make these proteins prone to aggregation, triggering specific disease-related cascades. Recent studies have indicated associations between aberrant behavior of amyloid-beta and tau proteins and various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as retinal neurodegenerative diseases like Glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Additionally, these proteins have been linked to cardiovascular disease, cancer, traumatic brain injury, and diabetes, which are all leading causes of morbidity and mortality. In this comprehensive review, we provide an overview of the connections between amyloid-beta and tau proteins and a spectrum of disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "The study of modified RNA known as epitranscriptomics has become increasingly relevant in our understanding of disease-modifying mechanisms. Methylation of N6 adenosine (m6A) and C5 cytosine (m5C) bases occur on mRNAs, tRNA, mt-tRNA, and rRNA species as well as non-coding RNAs. With emerging knowledge of RNA binding proteins that act as writer, reader, and eraser effector proteins, comes a new understanding of physiological processes controlled by these systems. Such processes when spatiotemporally disrupted within cellular nanodomains in highly specialized tissues such as the brain, give rise to different forms of disease. In this review, we discuss accumulating evidence that changes in the m6A and m5C methylation systems contribute to neurocognitive disorders. Early studies first identified mutations within FMR1 to cause intellectual disability Fragile X syndromes several years before FMR1 was identified as an m6A RNA reader protein. Subsequently, familial mutations within the m6A writer gene METTL5, m5C writer genes NSUN2, NSUN3, NSUN5, and NSUN6, as well as THOC2 and THOC6 that form a protein complex with the m5C reader protein ALYREF, were recognized to cause intellectual development disorders. Similarly, differences in expression of the m5C writer and reader effector proteins, NSUN6, NSUN7, and ALYREF in brain tissue are indicated in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, individuals with a high neuropathological load or have suffered traumatic brain injury. Likewise, an abundance of m6A reader and anti-reader proteins are reported to change across brain regions in Lewy bodies diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with high cognitive reserve. m6A-modified RNAs are also reported significantly more abundant in dementia with Lewy bodies brain tissue but significantly reduced in Parkinson's disease tissue, whilst modified RNAs are misplaced within diseased cells, particularly where synapses are located. In parahippocampal brain tissue, m6A modification is enriched in transcripts associated with psychiatric disorders including conditions with clear cognitive deficits. These findings indicate a diverse set of molecular mechanisms are influenced by RNA methylation systems that can cause neuronal and synaptic dysfunction underlying neurocognitive disorders. Targeting these RNA modification systems brings new prospects for neural regenerative therapies.",

Although at first it was considered innocuous, small vessel disease is nowadays regarded as one of the major vascular causes of dementia. Radiological signs of small vessel disease include small subcortical infarcts, white matter magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensities, lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, cerebral microbleeds, and brain atrophy; however, great heterogeneity in clinical symptoms is observed in small vessel disease patients. The pathophysiology of these lesions has been linked to multiple processes, such as hypoperfusion, defective cerebrovascular reactivity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Notably, studies on small vessel disease suggest that blood-brain barrier dysfunction is among the earliest mechanisms in small vessel disease and might contribute to the development of the hallmarks of small vessel disease. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide a new foundation in the study of small vessel disease pathology. First, we discuss the main structural domains and functions of the blood-brain barrier. Secondly, we review the most recent evidence on blood-brain barrier dysfunction linked to small vessel disease.

Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, especially specific proteolysis, could be a driving force for Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration. Tau physiologically promotes the assembly and stabilization of microtubules, whereas specific truncated fragments are sufficient to induce abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregate into toxic oligomers, resulting in them gaining prion-like characteristics. In addition, Tau truncations cause extensive impairments to neural and glial cell functions and animal cognition and behavior in a fragment-dependent manner. This review summarizes over 60 proteolytic cleavage sites and their corresponding truncated fragments, investigates the role of specific truncations in physiological and pathological states of Alzheimer's disease, and summarizes the latest applications of strategies targeting Tau fragments in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Neuroinflammation is widely recognized as a significant hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To combat neuroinflammation, the inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme has been demonstrated crucial. Importantly, sEH inhibition could be related to other neuroprotective pathways described in AD. The aim of the study was to unveil new molecular pathways driving neuroprotection through sEH, we used an optimized, potent, and selective sEH inhibitor (sEHi, UB-SCG-51). UB-SCG-51 was tested in neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, in primary mouse and human astrocytes cultures challenged with proinflammatory insults and in microglia cultures treated with amyloid oligomers, as well as in mice AD model (5XFAD). UB-SCG-51 (10 and 30\u2009\u03bcM) prevented neurotoxic reactive-astrocyte conversion in primary mouse astrocytes challenged with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and C1q (T/I/C) combination for 24\u2009h. Moreover, in microglial cultures, sEHi reduced inflammation and glial activity. In addition, UB-SCG-51 rescued 5XFAD cognitive impairment, reducing the number of Amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and Tau hyperphosphorylation accompanied by a reduction in neuroinflammation and apoptotic markers. Notably, a transcriptional profile analysis revealed a new pathway modulated by sEHi treatment. Specifically, the eIF2\u03b1/CHOP pathway, which promoted the endoplasmic reticulum response, was increased in the 5XFAD-treated group. These findings were confirmed in human primary astrocytes by combining sEHi and eIF2\u03b1 inhibitor (eIF2\u03b1i) treatment. Besides, combining both treatments resulted in increased in C3 gene expression after T/I/C compared with the group treated with sEHi alone in cultures. Therefore, sEHi rescued cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in AD mice model, based on the reduction of inflammation and eIF2\u03b1/CHOP signaling pathway. In whole, our results support the concept that targeting neuroinflammation through sEH inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy to fight against Alzheimer's disease with additive and/or synergistic activities targeting neuroinflammation and cell stress.",

We used UK Biobank (UKBB) data to investigate the relation of mitochondrial SNP rs2853499, with AD. To identify cases of AD we used ICD10 code G30.9. Data processing was performed on Minerva, a Linux mainframe with Centos 7.6, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We used PLINK, a whole-genome association analysis toolset, to analyze the UKB22418 mitochondrial hard-called chromosome file. Of 953 AD cases, 493 were male (51.7%) and 460 were female (48.3%). Mothers were twice as likely to transmit AD compared to fathers. We found that in individuals with AD, 22.3% (n=201) carried the A allele of SNP rs2853499, 77.7% (n=700) carried the G allele. In individuals without AD, 22.2% (n=10,7726) carried the A allele of SNP rs2853499, 77.8% (n=378,535) carried the G allele. This difference was not significant (p=0.91, two-tailed Fisher exact test). Therefore, factors other than mitochondrial SNP rs2853499 may be at work to promote maternal transmission of AD. We conclude that depression, a multigenic illness, in the mother is most likely the basis for the fact that mothers transmit AD twice as often as fathers.",

Numerous studies have asserted a close association between neuroinflammation and disrupted cerebral energetics. During AD progression and other neurodegenerative disorders, a persistent state of chronic neuroinflammation reportedly exacerbates cytotoxicity and potentiates neuronal death. Here, we assessed the impact of a neuroinflammatory challenge on metabolic demand and microvascular hemodynamics in the somatosensory cortex of an AD mouse model. We utilized in vivo 2-photon microscopy and the phosphorescent oxygen sensor Oxyphor 2P to measure partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and capillary red blood cell flux in cortical microvessels of awake mice. Intravascular pO2 and capillary RBC flux measurements were performed in 8-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and wildtype littermates on days 0, 7, and 14 of a 14-day period of lipopolysaccaride-induced neuroinflammation. Before the induced inflammatory challenge, AD mice demonstrated reduced metabolic demand but similar capillary red blood cell flux as their wild type counterparts. Neuroinflammation provoked significant reductions in cerebral intravascular oxygen levels and elevated oxygen extraction in both animal groups, without significantly altering red blood cell flux in capillaries. This study provides evidence that neuroinflammation alters cerebral oxygen demand at the early stages of AD without substantially altering vascular oxygen supply. The results will guide our understanding of neuroinflammation's influence on neuroimaging biomarkers for early AD diagnosis.",

Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for APOE4 (rs429358; \u03b2 : 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.69; p =8.67x10 -25 ) and a genome-wide significant association for ZMIZ1 (rs6480922; \u03b2 : -0.33, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.22; p =1.42x10 -8 ). The increased p-S65-Ub levels in APOE4 -carrier may be mediated by both co-pathology-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which was confirmed in Apoe-targeted replacement mice and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Intriguingly, ZMIZ1 rs6480922 also significantly associated with increased brain weight and reduced neuropathological burden indicating a potential role as a resilience factor. Our findings nominate novel mitophagy regulators in LBD brain ( ZMIZ1 locus) and highlight a strong association of APOE4 with mitophagy alteration. With APOE4 being the strongest known risk factor for clinical Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, our findings suggest a common mechanistic link underscoring the importance of mitochondrial quality control.",

The retrospective varying coefficient mixed model association test (RVMMAT) was used in longitudinal GWAS to detect time-varying genetic effects on the impairment status and SUVR measures. Post-hoc analyses were performed on genome-wide significant SNPs, including 1) pathway analyses; 2) age-stratified genotypic comparisons and regression analyses; and 3) replication analyses using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Our model identified 244 genome-wide significant SNPs that revealed time-varying genetic effects on the clinical impairment status in AD; among which, 12 SNPs on chromosome 19 were successfully replicated using data from NACC. Post-hoc age-stratified analyses indicated that for most of these 244 SNPs, the maximum genotypic effect on impairment status occurred between 70 to 80 years old, and then declined with age. Our model further identified 73 genome-wide significant SNPs associated with the temporal variation of amyloid accumulation. For these SNPs, an increasing genotypic effect on PET-SUVR was observed as participants' age increased. Functional pathway analyses on significant SNPs for both phenotypes highlighted the involvement and disruption of immune responses- and neuroinflammation-related pathways in AD. We demonstrate that longitudinal GWAS models with time-varying coefficients can boost the statistical power in AD-GWAS. In addition, our analyses uncovered potential time-varying genetic variants on repeated measurements of clinical and biological phenotypes in AD.",

Here, we report major limitations in current GWAS-by-proxy (GWAX) practices due to uncorrected survival bias and non-random participation of parental illness survey, which cause substantial discrepancies between AD GWAS and GWAX results. We demonstrate that current AD GWAX provide highly misleading genetic correlations between AD risk and higher education which subsequently affects a variety of genetic epidemiologic applications involving AD and cognition. Our study sheds important light on the design and analysis of mid-aged biobank cohorts and underscores the need for caution when interpreting genetic association results based on proxy-reported parental disease history.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid beta, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal cell death. These phenotypes correlate with and are linked to elevated neuronal intracellular calcium ( i Ca 2+ ) levels. Recently, our group reported that mitochondrial calcium ( m Ca 2+ ) overload, due to loss of m Ca 2+ efflux capacity, contributes to AD development and progression. We also noted proteomic remodeling of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel (mtCU) in sporadic AD brain samples, suggestive of altered m Ca 2+ uptake in AD. Since the mtCU is the primary mechanism for Ca 2+ uptake into the mitochondrial matrix, inhibition of the mtCU has the potential to reduce or prevent m Ca 2+ overload in AD. Here, we report that neuronal-specific loss of mtCU-dependent m Ca 2+ uptake in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD reduced A\u03b2 and tau-pathology, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Knockdown of Mcu in a cellular model of AD significantly decreased matrix Ca 2+ content, oxidative stress, and cell death. These results suggest that inhibition of neuronal m Ca 2+ uptake is a novel therapeutic target to impede AD progression.",

They include non-ribosomally synthesised peptides, post-translationally modified proteins, expressed or synthesised proteins containing unnatural amino acids, and peptides and proteins that are chemically modified. Here, we describe a general procedure for generating atomic descriptions required to incorporate ncAAs within popular NMR structure determination software such as CYANA, CNS, Xplor-NIH and ARIA. This procedure is made publicly available via the existing Automated Topology Builder (ATB) server (https://atb.uq.edu.au, last access: 17 February 2023) with all submitted ncAAs stored in a dedicated database. The described procedure also includes a general method for linking of side\u00a0chains of amino acids from CYANA templates. To ensure compatibility with other systems, atom names comply with IUPAC guidelines. In addition to describing the workflow, 3D models of complex natural products generated by CYANA are presented, including vancomycin. In order to demonstrate the manner in which the templates for ncAAs generated by the ATB can be used in practice, we use a combination of CYANA and CNS to solve the structure of a synthetic peptide designed to disrupt Alzheimer-related protein-protein interactions. Automating the generation of structural templates for ncAAs will extend the utility of NMR spectroscopy to studies of more complex biomolecules, with applications in the rapidly growing fields of synthetic biology and chemical biology. The procedures we outline can also be used to standardise the creation of structural templates for any amino acid and thus have the potential to impact structural biology more generally.",

Gem is used to lower the levels of triglycerides and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in patients. Experimental studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that Gem can prevent or slow the progression of neurological disorders (NDs), including cerebral ischemia (CI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Neuroinflammation is known to play a significant role in these disorders. The literature review for this study was conducted by searching Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. The results of this study show that Gem has neuroprotective effects through several cellular and molecular mechanisms such as: (1) Gem has the ability to upregulate pro-survival factors (PGC-1\u03b1 and TFAM), promoting the survival and function of mitochondria in the brain, (2) Gem strongly inhibits the activation of NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and C/EBP\u03b2 in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells, which are known to increase the expression of iNOS and the production of NO in response to proinflammatory cytokines, (3) Gem protects dopamine neurons in the MPTP mouse model of PD by increasing the expression of PPAR\u03b1, which in turn stimulates the production of GDNF in astrocytes, (4) Gem reduces amyloid plaque pathology, reduces the activity of glial cells, and improves memory, (5) Gem increases myelin genes expression (MBP and CNPase) via PPAR-\u03b2, and (6) Gem increases hippocampal BDNF to counteract depression.

Disulfidptosis is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death that holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for various disorders. However, the functional roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in AD remain unknown. Microarray data and clinical information from patients with AD and healthy controls were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. A thorough examination of DRG expression and immune characteristics in both groups was performed. Based on the identified DRGs, we performed an unsupervised clustering analysis to categorize the AD samples into various disulfidptosis-related molecular clusters. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to select hub genes specific to disulfidptosis-related AD clusters. The performances of various machine learning models were compared to determine the optimal predictive model. The predictive ability of the optimal model was assessed using nomogram analysis and five external datasets. Eight DRGs showed differential expression between the AD and control samples. Two different molecular clusters were identified. The immune cell infiltration analysis revealed distinct differences in the immune microenvironment of the two clusters. The support vector machine model showed the highest performance, and a panel of five signature genes was identified, which showed excellent performance on the external validation datasets. The nomogram analysis also showed high accuracy in predicting AD. We identified disulfidptosis-related molecular clusters in AD and established a novel risk model to assess the likelihood of developing AD. These findings revealed a complex association between disulfidptosis and AD, which may aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets for this debilitating disorder.",

Dendrimers Delivery (DDs) is one of the most promising advancements in nanotechnology for biomedical applications, particularly drug delivery. Some of the main categories of dendrimers employed in the successful management of neurodegenerative illnesses are polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM) dendrimers, polypropylenimine dendrimers (PPI), Poly-l-lysine dendrimers (PLL), and carbosilane dendrimers. The tight blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the entry of medications or therapeutic agents, makes it difficult to treat central nervous system disorders. Dendrimers have attracted the attention of scientists more than other non-invasive methods of drug delivery across the BBB and improve the uptake of medicines in the brain's target tissues.

Here, we investigated the role of survivin in the modulation of hippocampal neurogenesis in AD. To investigate the effect of survivin on neurogenesis in neural stem cells (NSCs), we treated mouse embryonic NSCs with a survivin inhibitor (YM155) and adeno-associated viral survivin (AAV-Survivin). To explore the potential role of survivin expression in AD, AAV9-Survivin or AAV9-GFP were injected into the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus of 7-month-old wild-type and 5XFAD mice. Cognitive function was measured by the Y maze and Morris water maze. Neurogenesis was investigated by BrdU staining, immature, and mature neuron markers. Our results indicate that suppression of survivin expression resulted in decreased neurogenesis. Conversely, overexpression of survivin using AAV-Survivin restored neurogenesis in NSCs that had been suppressed by YM155 treatment. Furthermore, the expression level of survivin decreased in the 9-month-old 5XFAD compared with that in wild-type mice. AAV-Survivin-mediated overexpression of survivin in the DG in 5XFAD mice enhanced neurogenesis and cognitive function. Hippocampal neurogenesis can be enhanced by survivin overexpression, suggesting that survivin could serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.",

The brain correlates of these non-image-forming effects have been investigated, notably using magnetic resonance imaging and short light exposures varying in irradiance and spectral quality. However, it is not clear whether non-image-forming responses estimation may be biased by having light in sequential blocks, for example, through a potential carryover effect of one light onto the next. We reasoned that pupil light reflex was an easy readout of one of the non-image-forming effects of light that could be used to address this issue. We characterised the sustained pupil light reflex in 13-16 healthy young individuals under short light exposures during three distinct cognitive processes (executive, emotional and attentional). Light conditions pseudo-randomly alternated between monochromatic orange light (0.16 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux) and polychromatic blue-enriched white light of three different levels (37, 92, 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux). As expected, higher melanopic irradiance was associated with larger sustained pupil light reflex in each cognitive domain. This result was stable over the light sequence under higher melanopic irradiance levels compared with lower ones. Exploratory frequency-domain analyses further revealed that sustained pupil light reflex was more variable under lower melanopic irradiance levels. Importantly, sustained pupil light reflex varied across tasks independently of the light condition, pointing to a potential impact of light history and/or cognitive context on sustained pupil light reflex. Together, our results emphasise that the distinct contribution and adaptation of the different retinal photoreceptors influence the non-image-forming effects of light and therefore potentially their brain correlates.",

These functional enhancers show unique mutational patterns independent of classical significantly mutated genes in melanoma. Target gene analysis for the essential enhancers reveal many known and hidden mechanisms underlying melanoma growth. Utilizing extensive functional validation experiments, we demonstrate that a super enhancer element could modulate melanoma cell proliferation by targeting MEF2A, and another distal enhancer is able to sustain PTEN tumor-suppressive potential via long-range interactions.

Furthermore, the tau PTM profile changes during tau pathology formation and disease progression, and disease-specific PTMs are detected in and around the filament core.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind this association remain elusive. With emerging multimodal data for these mechanisms, machine learning methods can be applied for phenotype prediction at different scales, but due to the black-box nature of machine learning, integrating these modalities and interpreting biological mechanisms can be challenging. Additionally, the partial availability of these multimodal data presents a challenge in developing these predictive models. To address these challenges, we developed DeepGAMI, an interpretable neural network model to improve genotype-phenotype prediction from multimodal data. DeepGAMI leverages functional genomic information, such as eQTLs and gene regulation, to guide neural network connections. Additionally, it includes an auxiliary learning layer for cross-modal imputation allowing the imputation of latent features of missing modalities and thus predicting phenotypes from a single modality. Finally, DeepGAMI uses integrated gradient to prioritize multimodal features for various phenotypes. We applied DeepGAMI to several multimodal datasets including genotype and bulk and cell-type gene expression data in brain diseases, and gene expression and electrophysiology data of mouse neuronal cells. Using cross-validation and independent validation, DeepGAMI outperformed existing methods for classifying disease types, and cellular and clinical phenotypes, even using single modalities (e.g., AUC score of 0.79 for Schizophrenia and 0.73 for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease). We demonstrated that DeepGAMI improves phenotype prediction and prioritizes phenotypic features and networks in multiple multimodal datasets in complex brains and brain diseases. Also, it prioritized disease-associated variants, genes, and regulatory networks linked to different phenotypes, providing novel insights into the interpretation of gene regulatory mechanisms. DeepGAMI is open-source and available for general use.",

This study aimed primarily to explore whether the roles of pets for LTCH-clients who own pets are comparable to the roles of pets for older adults in the general population. Furthermore, we explored potential pet-related problems that might be encountered in LTCH in practice, and the potential influences of pet ownership on caregiving relationships. These insights may help improve long-term care services in LTCH. This project started with a study using the Consensual Qualitative Research method (CQR). We conducted semi-structured interviews based on themes from our previous review (e.g., Relational Aspects, Emotional Aspects, and Social Aspects). Secondly, an online survey was used to confirm the findings from the CQR study by calculating Content Validity Index scores (in SPSS 26) regarding contents, relevance, and clarity. The survey also included open-ended questions on potential pet-related problems and their impact on caregiving relationships for LTCH-clients, family caregivers, and professional caregivers.

Information on AD prediction at the individual patient level will be useful in AD prevention. In this study, we aim to develop risk models for predicting AD onset at individual level using optimal set of predictors from multiple features. A total of 487 cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 796 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients were included from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. All the participants were assessed for clinical, cognitive, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers and followed for mean periods of 5.6\u00a0years for CN individuals and 4.6\u00a0years for MCI patients to ascertain progression from CN to incident prodromal stage of AD or from MCI to AD dementia. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Cox regression was applied for predictors selection and model construction. During the follow-up periods, 139 CN participants had progressed to prodromal AD (CDR\u2009\u2265\u20090.5) and 321 MCI patients had progressed to AD dementia. In the prediction of individual risk of incident prodromal stage of AD in CN individuals, the AUC of the final CN model was 0.81 within 5\u00a0years. The final MCI model predicted individual risk of AD dementia in MCI patients with an AUC of 0.92 within 5\u00a0years. The models were also associated with longitudinal change of Mini-Mental State Examination (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for CN and MCI models). An Alzheimer's continuum model was developed which could predict the Alzheimer's continuum for individuals with normal AD biomarkers within 3\u00a0years with high accuracy (AUC\u2009=\u20090.91). The risk models were able to provide personalized risk for AD onset at each year after evaluation. The models may be useful for better prevention of AD.",

We used FreeSurfer to segment 34 cortical regions of interest. Baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used as measures of cognitive performance. Group analyses assessed free-water measures (FW) and volume. Statistically significant FW regions based on ethnicity x group interactions were used in a stepwise regression function to predict total MMSE and MoCA scores. Random forest models were used to identify the most predictive brain-based measures of a dementia diagnosis separately for Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups. Results indicated elevated FW values for the left inferior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left banks of the superior temporal sulcus, left supramarginal gyrus, right amygdala, and right entorhinal cortex in Hispanic AD subjects compared to non-Hispanic AD subjects. These alterations occurred in the absence of different volumes of these regions in the two AD groups.

It is estimated that one in three elderly people die from AD or other dementias. Chinese herbal medicine as a potential drug for treating AD has gained growing interest from many researchers. Moschus, a rare and valuable traditional Chinese animal medicine, was originally documented in Shennong Ben Cao Jing and recognized for its properties of reviving consciousness/resuscitation. Additionally, Moschus has the efficacy of \"regulation of menstruation with blood activation, relief of swelling and pain\" and is used for treating unconsciousness, stroke, coma, and cerebrovascular diseases. However, it is uncertain whether Moschus has any protective effect on AD patients. We explored whether Moschus could protect glutamate (Glu)-induced PC12 cells from cellular injury and preliminarily explored their related action mechanisms. The chemical compounds of Moschus were analyzed and identified by GC-MS. The Glu-induced differentiated PC12 cell model was thought to be the common AD cellular model. The study aims to preliminarily investigate the intervention effect of Moschus on Glu-induced PC12 cell damage as well as their related action mechanisms. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cell apoptosis, autophagic vacuoles, autolysosomes or autophagosomes, proteins related to apoptosis, and the proteins related to autophagy were examined and analyzed. Seventeen active compounds of the Moschus sample were identified based on GC-MS analysis. In comparison to the control group, Glu stimulation increased cell viability loss, LDH release, mitochondrial damage, loss of MMP, apoptosis rate, and the number of cells containing autophagic vacuoles, and autolysosomes or autophagosomes, while these results were decreased after the pretreatment with Moschus and 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Furthermore, Glu stimulation significantly increased cleaved caspase-3, Beclin1, and LC3II protein expression, and reduced B-cell lymphoma 2/BAX ratio and p62 protein expression, but these results were reversed after pretreatment of Moschus and 3-MA. Moschus has protective activity in Glu-induced PC12 cell injury, and the potential mechanism might involve the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. Our study may promote research on Moschus in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, and Moschus may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",

We included 25 patients with a maximum five years of disease duration and 25 controls, and isolated four immune cell populations from each fresh blood sample. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles were generated from 186 samples using the Illumina MethylationEpic array and association with disease status was tested using linear regression models. We identified six differentially methylated CpGs in CD14+ monocytes and one in CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells. Four differentially methylated regions were identified in monocytes, including a region upstream of RAB32, a gene that has been linked to LRRK2. Methylation upstream of RAB32 correlated negatively with mRNA expression, and RAB32 expression was upregulated in Parkinson's disease both in our samples and in summary statistics from a previous study. Our epigenome-wide association study of early Parkinson's disease provides evidence for methylation changes across different peripheral immune cell types, highlighting monocytes and the RAB32 locus.

The brain structures involved in the physiopathology of apathy have also been connected to the brain structures involved in probabilistic reward learning in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This dilemma in question involves the challenge of selecting between a familiar option with a more predictable outcome, and another option whose outcome is uncertain and may yield potentially greater rewards compared to the known option. The aim of this study was to combine experimental procedures and computational modeling to examine whether, in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorders, apathy affects performance in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Through using a four-armed bandit reinforcement-learning task, we showed that apathetic older adults explored more and performed worse than non-apathetic subjects. Moreover, the mental flexibility assessed by the Trail-making test-B was negatively associated with the percentage of exploration. These results suggest that apathy is characterized by an increased explorative behavior and inefficient decision-making, possibly due to weak mental flexibility to switch toward the exploitation of the more rewarding options. Apathetic participants also took longer to make a choice and failed more often to respond in the allotted time, which could reflect the difficulties in action initiation and selection. In conclusion, the present results suggest that apathy in participants with neurocognitive disorders is associated with specific disturbances in the exploration-exploitation trade-off and sheds light on the disturbances in reward processing in patients with apathy.",

Here, we show that neuregulin-1, a glial growth factor, induces inflammatory cytokines and promotes phagocytic activity in vitro and augments microglial activation and plaque formation in 5XFAD Alzheimer's mice. Brain-specific targeting of neuregulin-1 by intraventricular delivery of a novel neuregulin-1 fusion protein antagonist GlyB4 significantly alters microglial morphology and function to a non-pathogenic morphology in early-stage 5XFAD mice and prevents plaques from forming. Once plaques have already formed, GlyB4 reduces new plaque formation and prevents synaptic loss. Selective, targeted disruption of neuregulin-1 signaling on brain microglia with GlyB4 could be a novel 'upstream' approach to slow or stop disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.Significance StatementMicroglia-associated neuroinflammation is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we show that neuregulin1 (NRG1), an important neuron-glial signaling factor in development, induces microglial activation and promotes pathological changes in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of NRG1 using a targeted NRG1 antagonist called GlyB4 blocks NRG1 receptor activation in microglia, reduces Amyloid \u03b2 plaque formation, and prevents synaptic loss. While NRG1 clearly has important functions at other sites in the nervous system, excessive NRG1 signaling in microglia leads to pathological neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Selective disruption of NRG1 signaling in microglia using GlyB4 could be a novel approach to block disease progression in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

While a popular therapeutic target, it is unknown whether molecular mechanisms leading to disrupted L-VGCC across neurodegenerative disorders are conserved. Importantly, L-VGCC integrate synaptic signals to facilitate a plethora of cellular mechanisms; however, mechanisms that regulate L-VGCC channel density and subcellular compartmentalization are understudied. Herein, we report that in disease models with overactive mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling (or mTORopathies), deficits in dendritic L-VGCC activity are associated with increased expression of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Parkinsonism-associated deglycase (DJ-1). DJ-1 binds the mRNA coding for the alpha and auxiliary Ca2+ channel subunits CaV1.2 and \u03b12\u03b42, and represses their mRNA translation, only in the disease states, specifically preclinical models of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In agreement, DJ-1-mediated repression of CaV1.2/\u03b12\u03b42 protein synthesis in dendrites is exaggerated in mouse models of AD and TSC, resulting in deficits in dendritic L-VGCC calcium activity. Finding of DJ-1-regulated L-VGCC activity in dendrites in TSC and AD provides a unique signaling pathway that can be targeted in clinical mTORopathies.",

So far, dozens of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) have been discovered, and they (members from KDM1 to KDM7 family) are important for neurodevelopment by regulating cellular processes, such as chromatin structure and gene transcription. The role of KDM5C and KDM7B in neural development is particularly important, and mutations in both genes are frequently found in human X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Functional disorders of specific KDMs, such as KDM1A can lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several KDMs can serve as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. At present, the function of KDMs in neurodegenerative diseases is not fully understood, so more comprehensive and profound studies are needed. Here, the role and mechanism of histone demethylases were summarized in neurodevelopment, and the potential of them was introduced in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "A series of salicylidene uracil (1-18) derived from 5-aminouracil and substituted salicylaldehydes were analyzed for cytotoxic activity and enzyme inhibitory potency. Nine out of eighteen derivatives (6-8, 10, 12-15, 18) are novel molecules synthesized for the first time in this work, and other derivatives were previously synthesized by our group. The compounds were characterized by Proton nuclear magnetic resonance, carbon nuclear magnetic resonance, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for their in vitro cytotoxicity against PC-3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma), A549 (human alveolar adenocarcinoma), and SHSY-5Y (human neuroblastoma) cancer cell lines and the nontumorigenic HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells) cell line. The 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde derived compound (8) was toxic to PC-3 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells, showing a promising IC50 value at 7.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.76\u2009\u03bcM. The present study also aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of the compounds against several key enzymes, namely carbonic anhydrase I and II (CA I and CA II), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and glutathione reductase (GR), which are implicated in various global disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, cancer, malaria, diabetes, and glaucoma. The inhibitory profiles of the tested compounds were assessed by determining their Ki values, which ranged from 2.96 to 9.24\u2009nM for AChE, 3.78 to 12.57\u2009nM for BChE, 8.42 to 25.74\u2009nM for CA I, 7.24 to 19.74\u2009nM for CA II, and 0.541 to 1.124\u2009\u03bcM for GR. Molecular docking studies were also performed for all compounds. Most derivatives exhibited much more effective inhibitory action compared with clinically used standards. Thus, our findings indicate that the salicylidene derivatives presented in this study are promising drug candidates that need further evaluation.",

        "AbstractText": "Spatial navigation is a complex function involving the integration and manipulation of multisensory information. Using different navigation tasks, many promising results have been achieved on the specific functions of various brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal place area). Recently, it has been suggested that a non-aggregate network process involving multiple interacting brain regions may better characterize the neural basis of this complex function. This paper presents an integrative approach for constructing and analyzing the functionally-specific network for spatial navigation in the human brain. Briefly, this integrative approach consists of three major steps: 1) to identify brain regions important for spatial navigation (nodes definition); 2) to estimate functional connectivity between each pair of these regions and construct the connectivity matrix (network construction); 3) to investigate the topological properties (e.g., modularity and small worldness) of the resulting network (network analysis). The presented approach, from a network perspective, could help us better understand how our brain supports flexible navigation in complex and dynamic environments, and the revealed topological properties of the network can also provide important biomarkers for guiding early identification and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice.",

Neurofilament, a potential biomarker for neurological disorders, has gained attention. Our study aims to investigate the relationship between serum neurofilament light (sNfL) levels and cognitive function in elderly individuals in the United States. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from participants aged 60 and above in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2014). We collected sNfL levels, cognitive function tests, sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and other variables. Weighted multiple linear regression models examined the relationship between ln(sNfL) and cognitive scores. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) visualization explored nonlinear relationships. The stratified analysis examined subgroups' ln(sNfL) and cognitive function association. The study included 446 participants (47.73% male). Participants with ln(sNfL) levels between 2.58 and 2.81\u2009pg/mL (second quintile) performed relatively well in cognitive tests. After adjusting for multiple factors, ln(sNfL) levels were negatively correlated with cognitive function, with adjusted \u03b2 (95% CI) as follows: immediate recall test (IRT): -0.763 (-1.301 to -0.224), delayed recall test (DRT): -0.308 (-0.576 to -0.04), animal fluency test (AFT): -1.616 (-2.639 to -0.594), and digit symbol substitution test (DSST): -2.790 (-4.369 to -1.21). RCS curves showed nonlinear relationships between ln(sNfL) and DRT, AFT, with inflection points around 2.7\u2009pg/mL. The stratified analysis revealed a negative correlation between ln(sNfL) and cognition in specific subgroups with distinct features, with an interaction between diabetes and ln(sNfL). Higher sNfL levels are associated with poorer cognitive function in the elderly population of the United States. sNfL shows promise as a potential biomarker for early identification of cognitive decline.",

This article aims to provide a systematic review of the efficacy, and safety of lecanemab in slowing clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. A comprehensive search of various databases, including the National Institute of Health clinical trials registry, PubMed, and the Cochrane library, was conducted until July 2023 using the keywords lecanemab, BAN2401, and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, conference abstracts listed in the Cochrane database (including Embase) and drug information from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label were examined. Only clinical trials published in the English language were considered. In total, 107 articles were retrieved, and after thorough evaluation, three randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trials involving 2729 participants were included in the analysis. The FDA approved lecanemab for Alzheimer's disease in January 2023 which acts as a novel disease-modifying anti-amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) human monoclonal antibody and is administered intravenously. Based on the clinical trials included in this review, lecanemab was found efficacious in reducing the accumulation of beta-amyloid and slowing down the cognitive decline and it was well tolerated. Lecanemab had a statistically significant change from baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAScog14), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL), and reductions in brain amyloid burden. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, infusion-related reactions, and Amyloid related imaging abnormalities-edema. Lecanemab therapy led to a substantial decrease in amyloid plaques and a noticeable slowing of clinical decline. The findings suggest a meaningful connection between the reduction in amyloid and the positive impact on patients' clinical outcomes, hinting at potential disease-modifying effects.",

Discussions of patients' needs and preferences between nurses and the patient's close family members have been found to be useful in preventing excessive stress in persons with dementia, while lessening the anxiety of care partners. However, the efficacy of dementia-specific interventions is influenced in part by the degree to which the interventions are flexible and sensitive to the patient's and care-partner's condition, needs, and preferences, including cultural preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the cultural appropriateness of Fam-FFC using the Ecological Validity Model (EVM). This qualitative, descriptive study included 28 consented care partners drawn from a sample of 455 dyads enrolled in the Fam-FFC intervention. An interview guide was created based on the EVM. Participants provided demographic data. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyze transcribed interviews. The majority of the sample was female (79%), Non-Hispanic (96%) and half were married. One-half of the sample represented Black care partners and one-half were White. Seventy-nine percent lived with their family member with ADRD. Three major themes were identified from the thematic analysis including Care Partner Identity, Care Partner Preferences, and Goals of Care for functional recovery of their family member living with dementia. In this study care partners wanted more social services as well as home care that supported not just physical needs but also social and recreational needs. Findings from the study offer guidance on improving the Fam-FFC intervention including strengthening education and resources on partner self-care.",

        "AbstractText": "Early postnatal life is a sensitive period of development that shapes brain structure and function later in life. Exposure to stress during this critical time window can alter brain development and may enhance the susceptibility to psychopathology and neurodegenerative disorders later in life. The developmental effects of early life stress (ELS) on synaptic function are not fully understood, but could provide mechanistic insights into how ELS modifies later brain function and disease risk. We here assessed the effects of ELS on synaptic function and composition in the hippocampus of male mice. Mice were subjected to ELS by housing dams and pups with limited bedding and nesting material from postnatal days (P) 2-9. Synaptic strength was measured in terms of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus at three different developmental stages: the early postnatal phase (P9), preadolescence (P21, at weaning) and adulthood at 3\u2009months of age (3MO). Hippocampal synaptosome fractions were isolated from P9 and 3MO tissue and analyzed for protein content to assess postsynaptic composition. Finally, dendritic spine density was assessed in the DG at 3MO. At P9, ELS increased mEPSC frequency and amplitude. In parallel, synaptic composition was altered as PSD-95, GluA3 and GluN2B content were significantly decreased. The increased mEPSC frequency was sustained up to 3MO, at which age, GluA3 content was significantly increased. No differences were found in dendritic spine density. These findings highlight how ELS affects the development of hippocampal synapses, which could provide valuable insight into mechanisms how ELS alters brain function later in life.",

This has created an increasing demand for alternative, human-based models capable of emulating key pathological phenotypes in vitro. Here, a three-dimensional Alzheimer's disease model was developed using a compartmentalized microfluidic device that combines a self-assembled microvascular network of the human blood-brain barrier with neurospheres derived from Alzheimer's disease-specific neural progenitor cells. To shorten microfluidic co-culture times, neurospheres were pre-differentiated for 21\u00a0days to express Alzheimer's disease-specific pathological phenotypes prior to the introduction into the microfluidic device. In agreement with post-mortem studies and Alzheimer's disease in vivo models, after 7\u00a0days of co-culture with pre-differentiated Alzheimer's disease-specific neurospheres, the three-dimensional blood-brain barrier network exhibited significant changes in barrier permeability and morphology. Furthermore, vascular networks in co-culture with Alzheimer's disease-specific microtissues displayed localized \u03b2-amyloid deposition. Thus, by interconnecting a microvascular network of the blood-brain barrier with pre-differentiated neurospheres the presented model holds immense potential for replicating key neurovascular phenotypes of neurodegenerative disorders in vitro.",

The clinical trial ALZLIGHT will utilize a novel Light Therapy System (LTS). The LTS uses Invisible Spectral Flicker for non-invasive induction of 40\u2009Hz neural activity. This protocol describes a trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a light-based 40\u2009Hz brain stimulation in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. 62 patients with mild-to-moderate AD will participate in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, and single-center trial.

We recruited a total of 759 Korean participants who underwent neuropsychological tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging, 18F-flutemetamol positron emission tomography, and microarray genotyping data. We performed gene-based association analysis, and also performed expression quantitative trait loci and network analysis. In genome-wide association studies, no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) passed the genome-wide significance threshold. In gene-based association analysis, six genes (LCMT1, SCRN2, LRRC46, MRPL10, SP6, and OSBPL7) were significantly associated with A\u03b2 standardised uptake value ratio in the brain. The three most significant SNPs (rs4787307, rs9903904, and rs11079797) on these genes are associated with the regulation of the LCMT1, OSBPL7, and SCRN2 genes, respectively. These SNPs are involved in decreasing hippocampal volume and cognitive scores by mediating A\u03b2 uptake.

Therefore, we investigated the sex-specific relationship between NAFLD and A\u03b2 deposition in a large-sized cohort of cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. We enrolled 673 (410 [60.9%] females and 263 [39.1%] males) CU individuals aged \u226545\u2009years who underwent A\u03b2 positron emission tomography (PET). The presence of NAFLD, assessed using the hepatic steatosis index, and the severity of NAFLD, assessed using the Fibrosis-4 index, were considered predictors.

Introducing genetic background diversity in AD mouse models has been proposed as a way to increase validity and enable the discovery of previously uncharacterized genetic contributions to AD susceptibility or resilience. However, the extent to which genetic background influences the mouse brain proteome and its perturbation in AD mouse models is unknown. In this study, we crossed the 5XFAD AD mouse model on a C57BL/6J (B6) inbred background with the DBA/2J (D2) inbred background and analyzed the effects of genetic background variation on the brain proteome in F1 progeny. Both genetic background and 5XFAD transgene insertion strongly affected protein variance in the hippocampus and cortex (n = 3,368 proteins). Protein co-expression network analysis identified 16 modules of highly co-expressed proteins common across the hippocampus and cortex in 5XFAD and non-transgenic mice. Among the modules strongly influenced by genetic background were those related to small molecule metabolism and ion transport. Modules strongly influenced by the 5XFAD transgene were related to lysosome/stress responses and neuronal synapse/signaling. The modules with the strongest relationship to human disease-neuronal synapse/signaling and lysosome/stress response-were not significantly influenced by genetic background. However, other modules in 5XFAD that were related to human disease, such as GABA synaptic signaling and mitochondrial membrane modules, were influenced by genetic background. Most disease-related modules were more strongly correlated with AD genotype in the hippocampus compared with the cortex. Our findings suggest that the genetic diversity introduced by crossing B6 and D2 inbred backgrounds influences proteomic changes related to disease in the 5XFAD model, and that proteomic analysis of other genetic backgrounds in transgenic and knock-in AD mouse models is warranted to capture the full range of molecular heterogeneity in genetically diverse models of AD.",

The gene comes in two major haplotypes, one associated with disease risk, and by comparison, the other with resilience. Only one coding polymorphism distinguishes the two alleles, a threonine-to-serine substitution at residue 185 (186 in mouse), that is inherited in disequilibrium with multiple non-coding variants. Transcriptional studies suggest synaptic, neuronal, and cognitive preservation in human subjects with the protective haplotype, while murine in vitro studies reveal dramatic effects of TMEM106B deletion on neuronal development. Despite this foundation, the field has not yet resolved whether coding variant is biologically meaningful, and if so, whether it has any specific effect on neuronal phenotypes. Here we studied how loss of TMEM106B or expression of the lone coding variant in isolation affected transcriptional signatures in the mature brain and neuronal structure during development in primary neurons. Homozygous expression of the TMEM106B T186S variant in knock-in mice increased cortical expression of genes associated with excitatory synaptic function and axon outgrowth, and promoted neurite branching, dendritic spine density, and synaptic density in primary hippocampal neurons. In contrast, constitutive TMEM106B deletion affected transcriptional signatures of myelination without altering neuronal development in vitro. Our findings show that the T186S variant is functionally relevant and may contribute to disease resilience during neurodevelopment.",

        "AbstractText": "Addressing the seminal pathophysiology in Alzheimer disease (AD) is the next logical focus for effective intervention, given the initial disappointing and more recent possibly encouraging results of monoclonal antibody trials. Endothelial cell dysfunction-induced blood-brain barrier leak with associated prolonged capillary mean transit time (cMTT) and glymphatic outflow dysfunction is the most proximal events in the degeneration cascade. Sensitive and reproducible markers are required to both identify early disease and assess future treatment trial outcomes. Two participants, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and one with AD, were evaluated clinically prior to MRI in this small case series report. From seven 3D turbo gradient and spin echo (TGSE) pulsed arterial spin echo (PASL) MRI sequences six homologous region of interest in bitemporal, bifrontal, and biparietal lobes for each sequence were examined and plotted against time. By choosing late perfusion times during cMTT phase of perfusion linear analysis of signal decay could be utilized. A reference axial FLAIR sequence was also obtained. Slope of the linear analysis correlated to the rate of labeled proton clearance with reduced clearance occurring in AD participants compared to normal participants in our previous study. Whether similar differences in clearance rate extend to either MCI or early AD was investigated. Participants were categorized by clinical phenotype before MRI and compared to previously published phenotype cohorts: n = 18 normal/healthy, n = 6 AD, n = 3 MCI. Significant differences in labeled proton clearance rates between AD and MCI/control phenotypes within bilateral temporal lobes (left p = 0.004, right p = 0.002) and within bilateral frontal lobes AD versus controls (left p = 0.001, right p = 0.008) and AD versus MCI (left p = 0.001, right p = 0.001) were found. This noninvasive MRI technique has potential for identifying MCI transition to AD.",

To this aim, it is necessary to determine factors that can alter blood-based concentrations of amyloid-\u03b2. We cross-sectionally analysed amyloid-\u03b2-40 and amyloid-\u03b2-42 concentrations and the 40/42 ratio in 440 community-dwelling adults and associations with body mass index, waist-to-height ratio and body composition assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Body mass index and waist-to-height ratio were inversely associated with plasma amyloid-\u03b2-42 concentrations. Body fat mass, but not body cell mass and extracellular mass, was inversely associated with amyloid-\u03b2-42 levels. The results indicate that plasma concentrations of amyloid-\u03b2-42 are lower in those with increased body mass index and body fat, and associations with amyloid-\u03b2-40 did not reach significance after controlling for multiple testing. The findings support the use of body mass index as an easy-to-measure factor that should be accounted for in diagnostic models for plasma amyloid-\u03b2.",

        "AbstractText": "People with dementia have an increase in brain inflammation, caused in part by innate and adaptive immune cells. However, it remains unknown whether dementia-associated diseases alter neuro-immune reflex arcs to impact the systemic immune system. We examined peripheral immune cells from a community-based cohort of older adults to test if systemic inflammatory cytokine signatures associated with early stages of cognitive impairment. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with monocyte or T-cell-targeted stimuli, and multiplex assays quantitated cytokines in the conditioned media. Following T-cell-targeted stimulation, cells from women with cognitive impairment produced lower amounts of TH17 cytokines compared with cells from cognitively healthy women, while myeloid-targeted stimuli elicited similar amounts of cytokines from cells of both groups. This TH17 signature correlated with the proportion of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light concentrations. These results suggest that decreases in TH17 cytokines could be an early systemic change in women at risk for developing dementia. Amelioration of TH17s cytokines in early cognitive impairment could, in part, explain the compromised ability of older adults to respond to vaccines or defend against infection.",

However, the functional properties of NbM and EC regarding amyloid-\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau remain unclear. We analysed resting-state functional fMRI data with CSF assays from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 71) at baseline and 2 years later. At baseline, local activity, as quantified by fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, differentiated between normal and abnormal CSF groups in the NbM but not EC. Further, NbM activity linearly decreased as a function of CSF ratio, resembling the disease status. Finally, NbM activity predicted the annual percentage signal change in EC, but not the reverse, independent from CSF ratio. Our findings give novel insights into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by showing that local activity in NbM is affected by proteinopathology and predicts functional degeneration within the EC.",

        "AbstractText": "Degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few mouse models of AD recapitulate the neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system. The p75 neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, has been associated with the degeneration of BFCNs in AD. The senescence-accelerated mouse prone number 8 (SAMP8) is a well-accepted model of accelerated and pathological aging. To gain a better understanding of the role of p75NTR in the basal forebrain during aging, we generated a new mouse line, the SAMP8-p75exonIII-/-. Deletion of p75NTR in the SAMP8 background induces an increase in the number of BFCNs at birth, followed by a rapid decline during aging compared to the C57/BL6 background. This decrease in the number of BFCNs correlates with a worsening in the Y-maze memory test at 6\u2009months in the SAMP8-p75exonIII-/-. We found that SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- and C57/BL6-p75exonIII-/- mice expressed constitutively a short isoform of p75NTR that correlates with an upregulation of the protein levels of SREBP2 and its targets, HMGCR and LDLR, in the BF of both SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- and C57/BL6-p75exonIII-/- mice. As the neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system and the dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism are implicated in AD, we postulate that the generated SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- mouse strain might constitute a good model to study long-term cholinergic neurodegeneration in the CNS. In addition, our results support the role of p75NTR signaling in cholesterol biosynthesis regulation.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) are Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers that interact in a complex manner to induce most of the cognitive and brain alterations observed in this disease. Since the neuronal cytoskeleton is a common downstream pathological target of tau and A\u03b2, which mostly lead to augmented microtubule instability, the administration of microtubule stabilizing agents (MSAs) can protect against their pathological actions. However, the effectiveness of MSAs is still uncertain due to their state-dependent negative effects; thus, evaluating their specific actions in different pathological or physiological conditions is required. We evaluated whether epothilone-D (Epo-D), a clinically used MSA, rescues from the functional and behavioral alterations produced by intracerebroventricular injection of A\u03b2, the presence of P-tau, or their combination in rTg4510 mice. We also explored the side effects of Epo-D. To do so, we evaluated hippocampal-dependent spatial memory with the Hebb-Williams maze, hippocampal CA1 integrity and the intrinsic and synaptic properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons with the patch-clamp technique. A\u03b2 and P-tau mildly impaired memory retrieval, but produced contrasting effects on intrinsic excitability. When A\u03b2 and P-tau were combined, the alterations in excitability and spatial reversal learning (i.e., cognitive flexibility) were exacerbated. Interestingly, Epo-D prevented most of the impairments induced A\u03b2 and P-tau alone and combined. However, Epo-D also exhibited some side effects depending on the prevailing pathological or physiological condition, which should be considered in future preclinical and translational studies. Although we did not perform extensive histopathological evaluations or measured microtubule stability, our findings show that MSAs can rescue the consequences of AD-like conditions but otherwise be harmful if administered at a prodromal stage of the disease.",

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 50-70% of cases, while frontotemporal dementia (FTD) affects social skills and personality. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides an effective tool to study the effects of AD on the brain. In this study, we propose to use shallow neural networks applied to two sets of features: spectral-temporal and functional connectivity using four methods. We compare three supervised machine learning techniques to the CNN models to classify EEG signals of AD / FTD and control cases. We also evaluate different measures of functional connectivity from common EEG frequency bands considering multiple thresholds.

This study evaluated the feasibility of the MIND GamePack\u00a9 for recurrent semi-passive assessment of cognition across a longitudinal interval. The MIND GamePack consists of four iPad-based games selected to be both familiar and enjoyable: Word Scramble, Block Drop, FreeCell, and Memory Match. Participants were asked to play 20\u2009min/day for 5\u2009days (100\u2009min) for 4\u2009months. Feasibility of use by older adults was assessed by measuring gameplay time and game performance. We also evaluated compliance through semi-structured surveys. A linear generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used to analyze changes in gameplay time, and a regression tree model was employed to estimate the days it took for game performance to plateau. Subjective and environmental factors associated with gameplay time and performance were examined, including daily self-reported questions of memory and thinking ability, mood, sleep, energy, current location, and distractions prior to gameplay. Twenty-six cognitively-unimpaired older adults participated (mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\u2009=\u200971.9\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6; 73% female).

Methodology The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) database was queried for visits including a UTI diagnosis and a urine culture order. Data were included for all visits involving adult women for available years, 2014-2016 and 2018. Data on demographics, reason for visit, T2DM status, UTI workup, and UTI treatment were collected. Patients with Alzheimer's disease or chronic kidney disease were excluded. Descriptive statistics were displayed as weighted means with standard errors for continuous variables.

Hence a network pharmacology approach was employed to investigate the plausible mechanism of A. recemosus. : Bioactive compounds of A. racemosus were extracted based on the TCMSP, PCIDB, and BATMAN-TCM database. The potential targets of bioactive compounds were collected using target fishing. Epilepsy and comorbid dementia genes were collected from DISGENET. A PPI network among these targets was constructed using the intersecting key targets between herb targets and disease targets. Besides, DAVID bioinformatics resource was utilized for the pathway enrichment analysis on GO and KEGG. Ultimately, phytochemical compound-target genes-Pathways network has been assembled utilizing Cytoscape to decipher the mechanism of the herb. The network analysis revealed that 5 targets (CASP3, TNF, VEGFA, PTGS2 and CNR1) might be the key therapeutic targets of asparagus on Epilepsy comorbid Alzheimer's disease. Based on high connectivity, four hub compounds with the highest connectivity were noted and it includes Shatavarin V, Sarsasapogenin, Shatavarin IX, and Shatavarin VI.

        "AbstractText": "Macroautophagy/autophagy receptors are essential for the recognition and clearance of specific cargos by selective autophagy, which is essential for maintaining MAPT proteostasis. Previous studies have implicated different autophagy receptors in directing distinct species of MAPT to autophagy, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Here we examine how the autophagy receptors NBR1 and SQSTM1 differentially associate with specific forms of MAPT. In primary neurons depletion of NBR1, unlike depletion of SQSTM1, significantly increased phosphorylated MAPT levels. The specificity of the interactions was confirmed using in vitro binding assays with purified proteins. We provide direct evidence that the co-chaperone BAG3 promotes the preferential association of NBR1 with monomeric MAPT and SQSTM1 with oligomeric MAPT. Using an in vitro affinity-isolation assay, we show that SQSTM1 only binds to monomeric MAPT when BAG3 is absent and fails to bind when BAG3 is present. The opposite is true of NBR1; its association with monomeric MAPT was dependent on the presence of BAG3. Interestingly, in Alzheimer disease brain the association of NBR1 with BAG3 was significantly decreased. In a mouse model, ablation of BAG3 in neural cells disrupted the association of NBR1 with phosphorylated MAPT and led to increased levels of phosphorylated and oligomeric MAPT. Overall, our results uncover a novel role for BAG3 in regulating the specificity of selective autophagy receptors in targeting different species of MAPT and provide compelling evidence that BAG3 plays a key role in maintaining MAPT proteostasis.Abbreviations: AD: Alzheimer disease; BAG3: BCL2-associated athanogene 3; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CERAD: Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; GST: glutathione S-transferases; MAPT: microtubule-associated protein tau; NBR1: NBR1, autophagy cargo receptor; NFT: neurofibrillary tangles; PMI: postmortem interval; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1.",

Inflammation is associated with multiple diseases including classical neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which over half of all patients experience some form of cognitive deficits. Other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) including frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and psychological disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), and even normal aging all have cytokine-associated reductions in cognitive function. Thus, there is likely commonality between these secondary cognitive deficits and inflammation. Neurological disorders are increasingly associated with substantial neuroinflammation, in which CNS-resident cells secrete cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 and interleukins (ILs) including IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. CNS-resident cells also respond to a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines, which can have both direct effects on neurons by changing the expression of ion channels and perturbing electrical properties, as well as indirect effects through glia-glia and immune-glia cross-talk. There is significant overlap in these cytokine and chemokine expression profiles across diseases, with TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 strongly associated with cognitive deficits in multiple disorders. Here, we review the involvement of various cytokines and chemokines in AD, MS, FTLD, PD, TBI, MDD, and normal aging in the absence of dementia. We propose that the neuropsychiatric phenotypes observed in these disorders may be at least partially attributable to a dysregulation of immunity resulting in pathological cytokine and chemokine expression from both CNS-resident and non-resident cells.",

        "AbstractText": "The over-activation of adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) is closely implicated in cognitive impairments of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Growing evidence shows that A2AR blockade possesses neuroprotective effects on AD. Spatial navigation impairment is an early manifestation of cognitive deficits in AD. However, whether A2AR blockade can prevent early impairments in spatial cognitive function and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. A transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model of AD amyloidosis was used in this study. Behavioral tests were conducted to observe the protective effects of A2AR blockade on early spatial memory deficits in 4-month old APP/PS1 mice. To investigate the underlying synaptic mechanism of the protective effects of A2AR blockade, we further examined long-term potentiation (LTP) and network excitation/inhibition balance of dentate gyrus (DG) region, which is relevant to unique synaptic functions of immature adult-born granule cells (abGCs). Subsequently, the protective effects of A2AR blockade on dendritic morphology and synaptic plasticity of 6-week-old abGCs was investigated using retrovirus infection and electrophysiological recordings. The molecular mechanisms underlying neuroprotective properties of A2AR blockade on the synaptic plasticity of abGCs were further explored using molecular biology methods. APP/PS1 mice displayed DG-dependent spatial memory deficits at an early stage. Additionally, impaired LTP and an imbalance in network excitation/inhibition were observed in the DG region of APP/PS1 mice, indicating synaptic structural and functional abnormalities of abGCs. A2AR was found to be upregulated in the hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Treatment with the selective A2AR antagonist SCH58261 for three weeks significantly ameliorated spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice and markedly restored LTP and network excitation/inhibition balance in the DG region. Moreover, SCH58261 treatment restored dendritic morphology complexity and enhanced synaptic plasticity of abGCs in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, SCH58261 treatment alleviated the impairment of synaptic plasticity in abGCs. It achieved this by remodeling the subunit composition of NMDA receptors and increasing the proportion of NR2B receptors in abGCs of APP/PS1 mice. Blockade of A2AR improves early spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice, possibly by reversing synaptic defects of abGCs. This finding suggests that A2AR blockade could be a potential therapy for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Various diseases, including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, have been reported to be linked to amyloid. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish amyloid from non-amyloid proteins or peptides. While experimental approaches are typically preferred, they are costly and time-consuming. In this study, we have developed a machine learning framework called iAMY-RECMFF to discriminate amyloidgenic from non-amyloidgenic peptides. In our model, we first encoded the peptide sequences using the residue pairwise energy content matrix. We then utilized Pearson's correlation coefficient and distance correlation to extract useful information from this matrix. Additionally, we employed an improved similarity network fusion algorithm to integrate features from different perspectives. The Fisher approach was adopted to select the optimal feature subset. Finally, the selected features were inputted into a support vector machine for identifying amyloidgenic peptides. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the identification of amyloidgenic peptides compared to existing predictors. This suggests that our method may serve as a powerful tool in identifying amyloidgenic peptides.

        "AbstractText": "Exposure to plastic nanoparticles has dramatically increased in the last 50 years, and there is evidence that plastic nanoparticles can be absorbed by organisms and cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). However, their toxic effects, especially on the nervous system, have not yet been extensively investigated, and most of the knowledge is based on studies using different conditions and systems, thus hard to compare. In this work, physicochemical properties of non-modified polystyrene (PS) and amine-functionalized PS (PS-NH2 ) nanoparticles are initially characterized. Advantage of a multisystemic approach is then taken to compare plastic nanoparticles effects in vitro, through cytotoxic readouts in mammalian cell culture, and in vivo, through behavioral readouts in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a powerful 3R-complying model organism for toxicology studies. In vitro experiments in neuroblastoma cells indicate a specific cytotoxic effect of PS-NH2 particles, including a decreased neuronal differentiation and an increased Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) secretion, a sensitive readout correlating with Alzheimer's disease pathology. In parallel, only in vivo treatments with PS-NH2 particles affect C. elegans development, decrease lifespan, and reveal higher sensitivity of animals expressing human A\u03b2 compared to wild-type animals. In summary, the multisystemic approach discloses a neurotoxic effect induced by aminated polystyrene nanoparticles.",

The last follow-up information on dementia was available from October 2021. The age at the end of the follow-up was 61.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.1 years, and 53% were women. Overall, we observed 9701 (4.4%) dementia, 6323 (2.9%) AD and 1918 (0.7%) VD cases. Individuals with CVD had a higher risk of developing dementia than unexposed individuals. In the multivariable-adjusted Cox models, stroke was most strongly associated with dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-1.8). CVD was more strongly associated with VD than with AD. Individuals with HF and MI had an increased risk of AD (HF: HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.19; MI: HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18). AF was associated with VD (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.42-1.77), but not with AD (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-1.09). Clinical characteristics, such as diabetes, smoking and alcohol abuse, were associated with both types of dementia. All major CVDs were associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, particularly VD.

This population-based study engaged 1,446 rural-dwelling older adults (age \u226560 years, 61.0% women) derived from MIND-China; of these, 402 were defined with MCI and 142 with AD. Plasma amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), total tau (t-tau), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentrations were analyzed using the Simoa platform. Data were analyzed using linear and logistic regression models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Across the AD clinical spectrum, plasma A\u03b240 and NfL increased, whereas A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio decreased. Plasma t-tau was higher in people with AD dementia than those with MCI or normal cognition. Plasma NfL outperformed other biomarkers in differentiating AD from normal cognition (area under the ROC curve [AUC]\u200a=\u200a0.75), but all plasma biomarkers performed poorly to distinguish MCI from normal cognition (AUC <0.60). Plasma NfL in combination with age, sex, education, and APOE genotype yielded the AUC of 0.87 for differentiating between AD and normal cognition, 0.79 between AD and MCI, and 0.64 between MCI and normal cognition. In this Chinese population, AD plasma biomarkers vary by age, sex, and APOE genotype. Plasma A\u03b2, t-tau, and NfL differ across the AD clinical spectrum, and plasma NfL appears to be superior to plasma A\u03b2 and t-tau for defining the clinical spectrum.",

Dysregulation of Fyn kinase has been implicated in various complex diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as different cancer types. Therefore, identifying small molecule inhibitors that can inhibit Fyn activity holds substantial significance in drug discovery. The aim of this study was to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors among bioactive phytoconstituents against tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn. Through a comprehensive approach involving molecular docking, drug likeliness filters, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we performed a virtual screening of a natural compounds library. This methodology aimed to pinpoint compounds potentially interacting with Fyn kinase and inhibiting its activity. This study finds two potential natural compounds: Dehydromillettone and Tanshinone B. These compoundsdemonstrated substantial affinity and specific interactions towards the Fyn binding pocket. Their conformations exhibitedcompatibility and stability, indicating the formation of robust protein-ligand complexes. A significant array of non-covalentinteractions supported the structural integrity of these complexes. Dehydromillettone and Tanshinone B emerge as promising candidates, poised for further optimization as Fynkinase inhibitors with therapeutic applications. In a broader context, this study demonstrates the potential of computationaldrug discovery, underscoring its utility in identifying compounds with clinical significance.

Here, we analyzed FTD linked gene GRN in 23 patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD and a family history of AD (FAD), not carrying mutations in AD candidate genes (PSEN 1, PSEN 2, and APP). In addition, Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene was studied too. All patients underwent an extensive neuropsychological battery. Genetic analyses were performed thought PCR assay and sequencing. Variants were annotated with ANNOVAR and allele frequency was checked on population databases. In silico prediction tools were consulted to check nonsynonymous variants and their effect on protein function and structure. The clinical data were retrospectively collected from medical records.

The objective was to examine the prevalence of sarcopenia and investigate the association between sarcopenia diagnostic components (muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical performance) and cognitive impairment in memory clinic patients. 368 patients were included (age 59.0\u00b17.25 years, women: 58.7%), displaying three clinical phenotypes of cognitive impairments, i.e., subjective cognitive impairment (SCI, 57%), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, 26%), and Alzheimer's disease (AD, 17%). Sarcopenia was defined according to diagnostic algorithm recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Components of sarcopenia were grip strength, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and gait speed. They were further aggregated into a score (0-3 points) by counting the numbers of limited components. Multi-nominal logistic regression was applied. Probable sarcopenia (i.e., reduced grip strength) was observed in 9.6% of the patients, and 3.5% were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Patients with faster gait speed showed less likelihood of MCI (odds ratio [OR]: 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.90) and AD (OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.60). One or more limited sarcopenia components was associated with worse cognitive function. After adjusting for potential confounders, the association remained significant only for AD (OR 4.29, 95% CI 1.45-11.92). The results indicate a connection between the sarcopenia components and cognitive impairments.

The accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques is a histopathological hallmark of AD and associated with increased astrocyte reactivity. In APP/PS1 mice modelling established AD (9 months), we now show an altered astrocytic morphology and enhanced activity of astrocytic hemichannels, mainly composed by connexin 43 (Cx43). Hemichannel activity in hippocampal astrocytes is also increased in two models of early AD: (1) mice with intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of A\u03b21-42, and (2) hippocampal slices superfused with A\u03b21-42 peptides. In hippocampal gliosomes of APP/PS1 mice, Cx43 levels were increased, whereas mice administered icv with A\u03b21-42 only displayed increased Cx43 phosphorylation levels. This suggests that hemichannel activity might be differentially modulated throughout AD progression. Additionally, we tested if adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) blockade reversed alterations of astrocytic hemichannel activity and found that the pharmacological blockade or genetic silencing (global and astrocytic) of A2AR prevented A\u03b2-induced hemichannel dysregulation in hippocampal slices, although A2AR genetic silencing increased the activity of astroglial hemichannels in control conditions. In primary cultures of astrocytes, A2AR-related protective effect was shown to occur through a protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Our results indicate that the dysfunction of hemichannel activity in hippocampal astrocytes is an early event in AD, which is modulated by A2AR.",

The MetS constitutes elevated fasting glucose, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension and increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, but the precise mechanism remains elusive. Insulin resistance, which develops from a diet rich in sugars and saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, is shared by the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are also a point of convergence, with altered dynamics in both the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of palmitate- and glucose-induced insulin resistance in the brain and its potential link through EVs to Alzheimer's disease is unknown. We demonstrate that palmitate and high glucose induce insulin resistance and amyloid precursor protein phosphorylation in primary rat embryonic cortical neurons and human cortical stem cells. Palmitate also triggers insulin resistance in oligodendrocytes, the supportive glia of the brain. Palmitate and glucose enhance amyloid precursor protein secretion from cortical neurons via EVs, which induce tau phosphorylation when added to na\u00efve neurons. Additionally, EVs from palmitate-treated oligodendrocytes enhance insulin resistance in recipient neurons. Overall, our findings suggest a novel theory underlying the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in MetS mediated by EVs, which spread Alzheimer's pathology and insulin resistance.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The evolving role of cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition beyond cardiovascular disease.",
        "AbstractText": "The main role of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. There is a long history of investigations regarding the inhibition of CETP as a target for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Initially, the potential effect on cardiovascular events of CETP inhibitors was hypothesized to be mediated by their ability to increase HDL cholesterol, but, based on evidence from anacetrapib and the newest CETP inhibitor, obicetrapib, it is now understood to be primarily due to reducing LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Nevertheless, evidence is also mounting that other roles of HDL, including its promotion of cholesterol efflux, as well as its apolipoprotein composition and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-diabetic properties, may play important roles in several diseases beyond cardiovascular disease, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and sepsis. Furthermore, although Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that higher HDL cholesterol is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), excess risk of AMD was absent in all CETP inhibitor randomized controlled trial data comprising over 70,000 patients. In fact, certain HDL subclasses may, in contrast, be beneficial for treating the retinal cholesterol accumulation that occurs with AMD. This review describes the latest biological evidence regarding the relationship between HDL and CETP inhibition for Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sepsis, and AMD.",

        "AbstractText": "Actin cytoskeleton is critical for neuronal shape and function. Drebrin and formins are key regulators of neuronal actin networks. Neuron-specific drebrin A is highly enriched in dendritic spines (postsynaptic terminals) of mature excitatory neurons. Decreased levels of drebrin in dendritic spines is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and other complex disorders, which calls for better understanding of its regulatory functions. Drebrin A was previously shown to inhibit actin nucleation and bundling by the diaphanous formin-2 (mDia2) - an actin nucleator that is involved in the initiation of dendritic spines. Characterization of the molecular binding interface between mDia2 and drebrin is necessary to better understand the functional consequences of this interaction and its biological relevance. Prior work suggested a multi-pronged interface between mDia2 and drebrin, which involves both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the drebrin molecule. Here we used mass spectrometry analysis, deletion mutagenesis, and an array of synthetic peptides of neuronal drebrin A to map its formin-binding interface. The mDia2-interacting interface on drebrin was narrowed down to three highly conserved 9-16 residue sequences that were used to identify some of the key residues involved in this interaction. Deletion of the C-terminal region of drebrin greatly reduces its binding to mDia2 and the extent of its inhibition of formin-driven actin assembly. Moreover, our experiments with formins from different subfamilies showed that drebrin is a specific rather than general inhibitor of these proteins. This work contributes to a molecular level understanding of the formin-drebrin interaction and will help to unravel its biological significance.",

Activated DIP2A interacts with several pathways, such as AMPK/mTOR and AKT pathways, to contribute to many biological processes, such as oxidative stress, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis. Dysregulated DIP2A activation has been implicated in numerous processes in the brain. If the upstream pathways of DIP2A remain globally unexplored, many proteins, including cortactin, AMPK, and AKT, have been identified as its downstream targets in the literature. Recent studies have linked DIP2A to a variety of mechanisms in many types of brain disorders, suggesting that regulation of DIP2A could provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for brain disorders. In this review, we comprehensively summarized and discussed the current research on DIP2A in various brain disorders, such as stroke, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), dyslexia, and glioma.",

Fungi, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.\u00a0cerevisiae), can be found in brain samples from patients with AD.

The Ure2p-seeded Tau fibrils are more potent in seeding Tau and causing neurotoxicity in\u00a0vitro. When injected into the hippocampus of Tau P301S transgenic mice, the Ure2p-seeded Tau fibrils show enhanced seeding activity compared with pure Tau fibrils. Strikingly, intracranial injection of Ure2p fibrils promotes the aggregation of Tau and cognitive impairment in Tau P301S mice. Furthermore, intranasal infection of S.\u00a0cerevisiae in the nasal cavity of Tau P301S mice accelerates the aggregation of Tau. Together, these observations indicate that the yeast protein Ure2p initiates Tau pathology.

Up to one-third of women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetime, often with TBI, yet remarkably little is known about the range of autopsy neuropathologies encountered in IPV. We report a prospectively accrued case series from a single institution, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, evaluated in partnership with the Brain Injury Research Center of Mount Sinai, using a multimodal protocol comprising clinical history review, ex vivo imaging in a small subset, and comprehensive neuropathological assessment by established consensus protocols. Fourteen brains were obtained over 2\u00a0years from women with documented IPV (aged 3rd-8th decade; median, 4th) and complex histories including prior TBI in 6, nonfatal strangulation in 4, cerebrovascular, neurological, and/or psychiatric conditions in 13, and epilepsy in 7. At autopsy, all had TBI stigmata (old and/or recent). In addition, white matter regions vulnerable to diffuse axonal injury showed perivascular and parenchymal iron deposition and microgliosis in some subjects. Six cases had evidence of cerebrovascular disease (lacunes and/or chronic infarcts). Regarding neurodegenerative disease pathologies, Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change was present in a single case (8th decade), with no chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathologic change (CTE-NC) identified in any. Findings from this initial series then prompted similar exploration in an expanded case series of 70 archival IPV cases (aged 2nd-9th decade; median, 4th) accrued from multiple international institutions. In this secondary case series, we again found evidence of vascular and white matter pathologies. However, only limited neurodegenerative proteinopathies were encountered in the oldest subjects, none meeting consensus criteria for CTE-NC. These observations from this descriptive exploratory study reinforce a need to consider broad co-morbid and neuropathological substrates contributing to brain health outcomes in the context of IPV, some of which may be potentially modifiable.",

Accordingly, molecules that mitigate the toxicity of hazardous protein aggregates are of great interest as potential future therapeutics. Here we asked whether a small peptide, composed of five amino acids (5MER peptide) that was derived from the human pro-inflammatory CD44 protein, could protect model nematodes from the toxicity of aggregative proteins that underlie the development of neurodegenerative disorders in humans. We found that the 5MER peptide mitigates the toxicity that stems from both; the AD-causing A\u03b2 peptide and a stretch of poly-glutamine that is accountable for the development of several disorders including HD, while minimally affecting lifespan. This protection was dependent on the activity of aging-regulating transcription factors and associated with enhanced A\u03b2 and polyQ35-YFP aggregation. A transcriptomic analysis unveiled that the peptide modifies signaling pathways, thereby modulating the expression of various genes, including these, which are known as protein homeostasis (proteostasis) regulators such as txt-13 and modifiers of proteasome activity. The knockdown of txt-13 protects worms from proteotoxicity to the same extent as the 5MER peptide, suggesting that the peptide activates the transcellular chaperone signaling to promote proteostasis. Together, our results propose that the 5MER peptide should be considered as a component of future therapeutic cocktails for the treatment of neurodegenerative maladies.",

But the impact of gut microbiota on these cognitive disturbances remains incompletely understood. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are major metabolites produced by gut microbiota during the digestion of dietary fiber, serving as an energy source for gut epithelial cells and/or circulating to other organs, such as the liver and brain, through the bloodstream. SCFAs have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and played crucial roles in brain metabolism, with potential implications in mediating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanisms that SCFAs might influence psychological functioning, including affective and cognitive processes and their neural basis, have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the dietary sources which determine these SCFAs production was not thoroughly evaluated yet. This comprehensive review explores the production of SCFAs by gut microbiota, their transportation through the gut-brain axis, and the potential mechanisms by which they influence age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Also, the review discusses the importance of dietary fiber sources and the challenges associated with harnessing dietary-derived SCFAs as promoters of neurological health in elderly individuals. Overall, this study suggests that gut microbiota-derived SCFAs and/or dietary fibers hold promise as potential targets and strategies for addressing age-related neurodegenerative disorders.",

One of the age-associated processes underlying chronic inflammation is protein aggregation, which is implicated in neuroinflammation and a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. We screened a panel of bioactive thiadiazolidinones (TDZDs) from our in-house library for rescue of protein aggregation in human-cell and C. elegans models of neurodegeneration. Among the tested TDZD analogs, PNR886 and PNR962 were most effective, significantly reducing both the number and intensity of Alzheimer-like tau and amyloid aggregates in human cell-culture models of pathogenic aggregation. A C. elegans strain expressing human A\u03b21-42 in muscle, leading to AD-like amyloidopathy, developed fewer and smaller aggregates after PNR886 or PNR962 treatment. Moreover, age-progressive paralysis was reduced 90% by PNR886 and 75% by PNR962, and \"healthspan\" (the median duration of spontaneous motility) was extended 29% and 62%, respectively. These TDZD analogs also extended wild-type C. elegans lifespan by 15-30% (p < 0.001), placing them among the most effective life-extension drugs. Because the lead drug in this family, TDZD-8, inhibits GSK3\u03b2, we used molecular-dynamic tools to assess whether these analogs may also target GSK3\u03b2. In silico modeling predicted that PNR886 or PNR962 would bind to the same allosteric pocket of inactive GSK3\u03b2 as TDZD-8, employing the same pharmacophore but attaching with greater avidity.

While JNK3 holds promise as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases, there remains a gap in the market for effective JNK3 inhibitors. Despite some pan-JNK inhibitors reaching clinical trials, no JNK-targeted therapies have achieved market approval. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a sophisticated virtual screening approach. We begin with an energy-based screening, subsequently integrating a variety of rescoring techniques. These encompass glide docking scores, MM/GBSA, and artificial scoring mechanisms such as DeepDock and advanced Graph Neural Networks. This virtual screening workflow is designed to evaluate and identify potential small-molecule inhibitors with high binding affinity. We have implemented a virtual screening workflow to identify potential candidate molecules. This process has resulted in the selection of ten molecules. Subsequently, these ten molecules have undergone biological activity evaluation to assess their potential efficacy. Impressively, molecule compound 6 surfaced as the most promising, exhibiting a potent kinase inhibitory activity marked by an IC50 of 130.1 nM and a notable reduction in TNF-\u03b1 release within macrophages. This suggests that compound 6 could potentially serve as an effective inhibitor for the treatment of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. The prospect of further medicinal modifications to optimize compound 6 presents a promising avenue for future research and development in this field. Utilizing binding pose metadynamics coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, we delved into the explicit binding mode of compound 6 to JNK3. Such insights pave the way for refined drug development strategies.

This review highlighted the great potential of these nanosystems for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. Studies regarding the encapsulation of synthetic and natural-derived molecules in these systems, for intravenous, oral, transdermal, or intranasal administration, have led to an increased brain bioavailability when compared to conventional pharmaceutical forms. Moreover, the developed formulations proved to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, including brain neurotransmitter level restoration and brain oxidative status improvement, and improved locomotor activity or enhancement of recognition and working memories in animal models. Hence, albeit being relatively new technologies, niosomes, transfersomes, and ethosomes have already proven to increase the brain bioavailability of psychoactive drugs, leading to increased effectiveness and decreased side effects, showing promise as future therapeutics.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorders worldwide. Its pathologic features include massive neuroinflammation with abnormal deposition of \u03b2-amyloid peptide in the cerebral tissues leading to degeneration of the brain neurons. Adverse effects associated with the traditional drugs used for the treatment of this pathological condition have directed the research efforts towards searching for alternative effective agents with minimal adverse effects. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential ameliorative effects of dapagliflozin and/or hesperidin on Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in rats. In a rodent model of AD, the effect of dapagliflozin with or without hesperidin on the biochemical parameters and the behavioral tests as well as the histopathological parameters was determined. Each of dapagliflozin and hesperidin restored the behavioral tests to the reference values, augmented the antioxidant defense mechanisms, ameliorated the neuronal inflammatory responses, combatted the changes in Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)/High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein signaling and receptors of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) levels, and restored the balance between the apoptotic signals and autophagy in the hippocampal tissues. Additionally, both agents exhibited an outstanding ability to combat LPS-induced perturbations in the histopathological and electron microscopic image of the brain tissues. These favorable effects were significantly encountered in the group treated with dapagliflozin/hesperidin combination when compared versus animals treated with either dapagliflozin or hesperidin. In conclusion, inhibition of the hippocampal HMGB1/TLR4/RAGE signaling, the pro-inflammatory axis, and apoptosis alongside augmentation of the antioxidant defenses and autophagy can be regarded as beneficial effects by which dapagliflozin/hesperidin combination may combat LPS-triggered AD.",

In a side-by-side comparison, we report the age-dependent development of cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits in comparison with the spatial-temporal evolution of cellular tau pathology in both models. We applied the SHIRPA primary screen and specific neuromotor, behavioral, and cognitive paradigms. The spatiotemporal development of tau pathology was investigated immunohistochemically. Levels of sarkosyl-insoluble paired helical filaments were determined via a MesoScale Discovery biomarker assay. Neuromotor impairments developed from age 3 months in both models. On electron microscopy, spinal cord neurofibrillary pathology was visible in mice aged 3 months; however, AT8 immunoreactivity was not yet observed in Tau58/4 mice. Behavioral abnormalities and memory deficits occurred at a later stage (>9 months) when tau pathology was fully disseminated throughout the brain. Spatiotemporally, tau pathology spread from the spinal cord via the midbrain to the frontal cortex, while the hippocampus was relatively spared, thus explaining the late onset of cognitive deficits. Our findings indicate the face and construct validity of both Tau58 models, which may provide new, valuable insights into the pathologic effects of tau species in vivo and may consequently facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets to delay or halt neurodegenerative processes occurring in tauopathies.",

In vitro and in vivo studies reveal their antidepressant, anxiolytic, and memory-enhancing effects in experimental dementia and Parkinson's disease. Chemical modification of natural substances by conjugation with various synthetic components is a modern method of obtaining new biologically active compounds. The discovery of new potential drugs among monoterpene derivatives is a progressive avenue within experimental pharmacology, offering a promising approach for the therapy of diverse pathological conditions. Biologically active substances such as monoterpenes, for example, borneol, camphor, geraniol, pinene, and thymol, are used to synthesize compounds with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsive, antidepressant, anti-Alzheimer's, antiparkinsonian, antiviral and antibacterial (antituberculosis) properties. Myrtenal is a perspective monoterpenoid with therapeutic potential in various fields of medicine. Its chemical modifications often lead to new or more pronounced biological effects. As an example, the conjugation of myrtenal with the established pharmacophore adamantane enables the augmentation of several of its pivotal properties.

        "AbstractText": "The human brain is composed of nearly one hundred billion neurons and an equal number of glial cells, including macroglia, i.e., astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain. In the last few decades, compelling evidence has revealed that glial cells are far more active and complex than previously thought. In particular, astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell population, not only take part in brain development, metabolism, and defense against pathogens and insults, but they also affect sensory, motor, and cognitive functions by constantly modulating synaptic activity. Not surprisingly, astrocytes are actively involved in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and other neurological disorders like brain tumors, in which they rapidly become reactive and mediate neuroinflammation. Reactive astrocytes acquire or lose specific functions that differently modulate disease progression and symptoms, including cognitive impairments. Astrocytes express several types of ion channels, including K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRP), aquaporins, mechanoreceptors, and anion channels, whose properties and functions are only partially understood, particularly in small processes that contact synapses. In addition, astrocytes express ionotropic receptors for several neurotransmitters. Here, we provide an extensive and up-to-date review of the roles of ion channels and ionotropic receptors in astrocyte physiology and pathology. As examples of two different brain pathologies, we focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most diffuse neurodegenerative disorders, and glioblastoma (GBM), the most common brain tumor. Understanding how ion channels and ionotropic receptors in astrocytes participate in NDs and tumors is necessary for developing new therapeutic tools for these increasingly common neurological conditions.",

A pathogenic role for Pg by disrupting placental homeostasis was proposed in the association between periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. On the basis that trophoblast-derived factors modulate endothelial and immune cell profiles in normal pregnancy and the scarce presence of Pg in placenta, we hypothesized that OMVs from Pg affect trophoblast cell phenotype, impairing trophoblast-endothelium and trophoblast-neutrophil interactions. By means of in vitro designs with first-trimester human trophoblast cells, endothelial cells, and freshly isolated neutrophils, we showed that Pg OMVs are internalized by trophoblast cells and modulate the activity and expression of functional markers. Trophoblast cells primed with Pg OMVs enhanced neutrophil chemoattraction and lost their anti-inflammatory effect. In addition, reduced migration with enhanced adhesion of monocytes was found in endothelial cells upon incubation with the media from trophoblast cells pretreated with Pg OMVs. Taken together, the results support a pathogenic role of Pg OMVs at early stages of pregnancy and placentation through disruption of trophoblast contribution to vascular transformation and immune homeostasis maintenance.",

        "AbstractText": "The monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4; Slc16a3) is expressed in the central nervous system, notably by astrocytes. It is implicated in lactate release and the regulation of glycolytic flux. Whether its expression varies during normal and/or pathological aging is unclear. As the presence of its mature transcript in the brain of young and old mice was determined, an unexpectedly longer RT-PCR fragment was detected in the mouse frontal cortex and hippocampus at 12 vs. 3 months of age. Cultured astrocytes expressed the expected 516 base pair (bp) fragment but treatment with IL-1\u03b2 to mimic inflammation as can occur during aging led to the additional expression of a 928 bp fragment like that seen in aged mice. In contrast, cultured pericytes (a component of the blood-brain barrier) only exhibited the 516 bp fragment. Intriguingly, cultured endothelial cells constitutively expressed both fragments. When RT-PCR was performed on brain subregions of an Alzheimer mouse model (APPswePS1dE9), no fragment was detected at 3 months, while only the 928 bp fragment was present at 12 months. Sequencing of MCT4 RT-PCR products revealed the presence of a remaining intron between exon 2 and 3, giving rise to the longer fragment detected by RT-PCR. These results unravel the existence of intron retention for the MCT4 gene in the central nervous system. Such alternative splicing appears to increase with age in the brain and might be prominent in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Hence, further studies in vitro and in vivo of intron 2 retention in the Slc16a3 gene transcript are required for adequate characterization concerning the biological roles of Slc16a3 isoforms in the context of aging and Alzheimer's disease pathology.",

Among CAMs, the IgLON family comprises five members: Opioid Binding Protein/Cell Adhesion Molecule Like (OPCML or OBCAM), Limbic System Associated Membrane Protein (LSAMP), neurotrimin (NTM), Neuronal Growth Regulator 1 (NEGR1), and IgLON5. IgLONs exhibit three N-terminal C2 immunoglobulin domains; several glycosylation sites; and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring to the membrane. Interactions as homo- or heterodimers in cis and in trans, as well as binding to other molecules, appear critical for their functions. Shedding by metalloproteases generates soluble factors interacting with cellular receptors and activating signal transduction. The aim of this review was to analyse the available data implicating a role for IgLONs in neuropsychiatric disorders. Starting from the identification of a pathological role for antibodies against IgLON5 in an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease with a poorly understood mechanism of action, accumulating evidence links IgLONs to neuropsychiatric disorders, albeit with still undefined mechanisms which will require future thorough investigations.",

Over 60% of these individuals live in low- and middle-income countries and are the worst affected, especially by its deleterious effects on the productivity of both patients and caregivers. Numerous risk factors for the disease have been identified and our understanding of gene-environment interactions have shed light on several gene variants that contribute to the most common, sporadic form of AD. Microglial cells, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), have long been established as guardians of the brain by providing neuroprotection and maintaining cellular homeostasis. A protein with a myriad of effects on various important signaling pathways that is expressed in microglia is the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing Inositol 5' Phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) protein. Encoded by the INPP5D (Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase D) gene, SHIP1 has diminutive effects on most microglia signaling processes. Polymorphisms of the INPP5D gene have been found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of AD. Several studies have elucidated mechanistic processes by which SHIP1 exerts its perturbations on signaling processes in peripheral immune cells. However, current knowledge of the controllers of INPP5D/SHIP1 expression and the idiosyncrasies of its influences on signaling processes in microglia and their relevance to AD pathophysiology is limited. In this review, we summarize these discoveries and discuss the potential of leveraging INPP5D/SHIP1 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.",

We conducted a univariate exome-wide association study and pair-wise pleiotropic analysis focused on AD and 16 cardiovascular traits-6 diseases and 10 cardio-metabolic risk factors-for 188,260 UK biobank participants. Our analysis pinpointed nine genetic markers in the APOE gene region and four loci mapped to the CDK11, OBP2B, TPM1, and SMARCA4 genes, which demonstrated associations with AD at p \u2264 5 \u00d7 10-4 and pleiotropic associations at p \u2264 5 \u00d7 10-8. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, we grouped the phenotypes from these pleiotropic associations into seven clusters. Lipids were divided into three clusters: low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. This split might differentiate the lipid-related mechanisms of AD. The clustering of body mass index (BMI) with weight but not height indicates that weight defines BMI-AD pleiotropy. The remaining two clusters included (i) coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction; and (ii) hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We found that all AD protective alleles were associated with larger weight and higher DM risk. Three of the four (75%) clusters of traits, which were significantly correlated with AD, demonstrated antagonistic genetic heterogeneity, characterized by different directions of the genetic associations and trait correlations. Our findings suggest that shared genetic factors between AD and cardiovascular traits mostly affect them in an antagonistic manner.",

The patient started to present memory decline and behavioral dysfunction in his early 60s. His brain imaging presented amyloid deposits by positron emission tomography (PET-CT). The multimer detection system (MDS) screening test for plasma for amyloid oligomers was also positive, which supported the AD diagnosis. It was verified that PSEN1 Glu318Gly itself may not impact amyloid production. However, additional variants were found in other AD and non-AD risk genes, as follows: SORL1 Glu270Lys was suggested as a risk mutation for AD and could increase amyloid peptide production and impair endosome functions. ABCA7 Val1946Met was a novel variant that was predicted to be damaging. The GRN Ala505Gly was a variant with uncertain significance; however, it may reduce the granulin levels in the plasma of dementia patients. Pathway analysis revealed that PSEN1 Glu318Gly may work as a risk factor along with the SORL1 and ABCA7 variants since pathway analysis revealed that PSEN1 could directly interact with them through amyloid-related and lipid metabolism pathways. TOMM40 and PSEN1 could have common mechanisms through mitochondrial dysfunction. It may be possible that PSEN1 Glu318Gly and GRN Ala505Gly would impact disease by impairing immune-related pathways, including microglia and astrocyte development, or NFkB-related pathways. Taken together, the five risk factors may contribute to disease-related pathways, including amyloid and lipid metabolism, or impair immune mechanisms.",

We investigated 18 microbes at the genus level that differed between solid normal tissue (n = 22) and primary tumors (n = 154). The tissue microbiome profiles of Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, and Rothia at the genus level differed between the solid normal tissue and primary tumors of HNSCC patients.

We then extracted 35 differentially expressed genes between the over- and under-the-median-for-Leptotrichia groups based on the criteria of >1.5 fold and p < 0.05 in the Mann-Whitney U-test. A pathway analysis showed that these Leptotrichia-related genes were associated with the pathways of Alzheimer disease, neurodegeneration-multiple diseases, prion disease, MAPK signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling, while protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that these genes formed a dense network.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of side-chain oxysterols on IL-1\u03b2 expression using HMC3 microglial cells and ApoE-deficient mice. Treatment of HMC3 cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHChol) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHChol) led to increased IL-1\u03b2 expression at the transcript and protein levels. Additionally, these oxysterols upregulated the surface expression of MHC II, a marker of activated microglia. Immunohistochemistry performed on the mice showed increased microglial expression of IL-1\u03b2 and MHC II when fed a high-cholesterol diet. However, cholesterol and 24s-hydroxycholesterol did not increase IL-1\u03b2 transcript levels or MHC II expression. The extent of IL-1\u03b2 increase induced by 25OHChol and 27OHChol was comparable to that caused by oligomeric \u03b2-amyloid, and the IL-1\u03b2 expression induced by the oxysterols was not impaired by polymyxin B, which inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1\u03b2 expression. Both oxysterols enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and Src, and inhibition of these kinase pathways with pharmacological inhibitors suppressed the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and MHC II. The pharmacological agents chlorpromazine and cyclosporin A also impaired the oxysterol-induced expression of IL-1\u03b2 and upregulation of MHC II. Overall, these findings suggest that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism leading to elevated levels of side-chain oxysterols, such as 25OHChol and 27OHChol, can activate microglia to secrete IL-1\u03b2 through a mechanism amenable to pharmacologic intervention. The activation of microglia and subsequent neuroinflammation elicited by the immune oxysterols can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Previously, we have shown in AD animal models that tolfenamic acid (TA) can lower the expression of AD-related genes and their products and subsequently reduce pathological burden and improve cognition. Using TA as a scaffold and the zinc finger domain of SP1 as a pharmacophore, we developed safer and more potent brain-penetrating analogs that interfere with sequence-specific DNA binding at transcription start sites and predominantly modulate the expression of SP1 target genes. More importantly, the proteome of treated cells displayed ~75% of the downregulated products as SP1 targets. Specific levels of SP1-driven genes and AD biomarkers such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau proteins were also decreased as part of this targeted systemic response.

In this study, we examined basic cognition and locomotion in 5XFAD mice with a C57BL6/J background (5XFAD-J) at 6 months of age, a period in which impairments of cognitive function and locomotion are commonly observed. We analyzed the effect sizes of cognitive and locomotive experiments in the 5XFAD mice compared with those in the wild-type mice. Our results suggest that for long-term memory analysis, the novel object recognition test (p = 0.013, effect size 1.24) required a sample size of at least 12 to obtain meaningful results. Moreover, analysis of general locomotion over total distance with the Laboratory Animal Behavior Observation, Registration and Analysis System (LABORAS) test during the dark phase (p = 0.007, effect size -1.37) needed a sample size of 10 for a statistical power (1-\u03b2) of 0.8. In conclusion, we can conduct more ethical and scientifically rigorous animal experiments using 5XFAD mice based on the effect and sample sizes suggested in this study.",

        "AbstractText": "This study was conducted to examine the chemical composition of the essential oils (EOs) from six Tunisian Eucalyptus species and to evaluate their anti-enzymatic and antibiofilm activities. The EOs were obtained through hydro-distillation of dried leaves and subsequently analyzed using GC/MS. The main class of compounds was constituted by oxygenated monoterpenes, particularly prominent in E. brevifolia (75.7%), E. lehmannii (72.8%), and E. woollsiana (67%). Anti-enzymatic activities against cholinesterases, \u03b1-amylase, and \u03b1-glucosidase were evaluated using spectrophotometric methods. Notably, the E. brevifolia, E. extensa, E. leptophylla, E. patellaris, and E. woollsiana EOs displayed potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (IC50: 0.25-0.60 mg/mL), with E. lehmannii exhibiting lower activity (IC50: 1.2 mg/mL). E. leptophylla and E. brevifolia showed remarkable \u03b1-amylase inhibition (IC50: 0.88 mg/mL), while E. brevifolia and E. leptophylla significantly hindered \u03b1-glucosidase (IC50 < 30 mg/mL), distinguishing them from other EOs with limited effects. Additionally, the EOs were assessed for their anti-biofilm properties of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) bacterial strains. The E. extensa EO demonstrated the main antibiofilm effect against E. coli and L. monocytogenes with an inhibition > 80% at 10 mg/mL. These findings could represent a basis for possible further use of Eucalyptus EOs in the treatment of human microbial infections and/or as a coadjutant in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease and/or diabetes mellitus.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) oligomers are the most neurotoxic forms of A\u03b2, and A\u03b2(1-42) is the prevalent A\u03b2 peptide found in the amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease patients. A\u03b2(25-35) is the shortest peptide that retains the toxicity of A\u03b2(1-42). A\u03b2 oligomers bind to calmodulin (CaM) and calbindin-D28k with dissociation constants in the nanomolar A\u03b2(1-42) concentration range. A\u03b2 and histidine-rich proteins have a high affinity for transition metal ions Cu2+, Fe3+ and Zn2+. In this work, we show that the fluorescence of A\u03b2(1-42) HiLyteTM-Fluor555 can be used to monitor hexa-histidine peptide (His6) interaction with A\u03b2(1-42). The formation of His6/A\u03b2(1-42) complexes is also supported by docking results yielded by the MDockPeP Server. Also, we found that micromolar concentrations of His6 block the increase in the fluorescence of A\u03b2(1-42) HiLyteTM-Fluor555 produced by its interaction with the proteins CaM and calbindin-D28k. In addition, we found that the His6-tag provides a high-affinity site for the binding of A\u03b2(1-42) and A\u03b2(25-35) peptides to the human recombinant cytochrome b5 reductase, and sensitizes this enzyme to inhibition by these peptides. In conclusion, our results suggest that a His6-tag could provide a valuable new tool to experimentally direct the action of neurotoxic A\u03b2 peptides toward selected cellular targets.",

The molecular lipophilicity potential (MLP) of the derivatives 22a, b and 23a, b was measured to determine which parts of the surface are hydrophobic and which are hydrophilic. In addition, the molecular polar surface area (PSA) was measured to determine the polar surface area and the non-polar surface area of the derivatives 22a, b and 23a, b.

Analysis was performed on a RP-C18 column with a binary gradient elution system consisting of methanol-potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.0, 0.02 M) as mobile phase. Samples of homotaurine and histidine (internal standard) were initially derivatized with ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) (0.01 M), N-acetylcysteine (0.01 M) and borate buffer (pH = 10.5; 0.05 M). To ensure the stability and efficiency of the reaction, the presence of different nucleophilic reagents, namely (a) 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), (b) N-acetylcysteine (NAC), (c) tiopronin (Thiola), (d) 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) and (e) captopril, was investigated.

The treatment of this disease has drawn considerable attention and sparked increased interest among the researchers in this field as a result of a number of factors, including an increase in the population of patients over time, a significant decline in patient quality of life, and the high cost of treatment and care. The current work was carried out for the synthesis of benzimidazole-oxazole hybrid derivatives as efficient Alzheimer's inhibitors and as a springboard for investigating novel anti-chemical Alzheimer's prototypes. The inhibition profiles of each synthesised analogue against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzymes were assessed. All the synthesized benzimidazole-based oxazole analogues displayed a diverse spectrum of inhibitory potentials against targeted AChE and BuChE enzymes when compared to the reference drug donepezil (IC50 = 2.16 \u00b1 0.12 M and 4.50 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b5M, respectively).

Materials and Methods: The study sample was derived from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD) cohort. The sample included 1607 NC individuals, 146 with aMCI (46 single-domain and 100 multi-domain), 92 with naMCI (41 single-domain and 51 multi-domain), and 79 with AD. Statistical analyses, adjusting for sex, age, and education, employed multivariate general linear models to probe differences among these groups. Results: Results showed that AD patients exhibited poorer performance in switching in both VF tasks and SVF clustering compared to NC. Similarly, the aMCI group performed worse than the NC in switching and clustering in both tasks, with aMCI performing similarly to AD, except for SVF switching. In contrast, the naMCI subgroup performed similarly to those with NC across most strategies, surpassing AD patients. Notably, the aMCI subgroup's poor performance in SVF switching was mainly due to the subpar performance of the multi-domain aMCI subgroup. This subgroup was outperformed in switching in both VF tasks by the single-domain naMCI, who also performed better than the multi-domain naMCI in SVF switching. No significant differences emerged in terms of perseverations and intrusions. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest a continuum of declining switching ability in the SVF task, with NC surpassing both aMCI and AD, and aMCI outperforming those with AD. The challenges in SVF switching suggest executive function impairment associated with multi-domain MCI, particularly driven by the multi-domain aMCI.",

Materials and Methods: Our approach entailed a systematic exploration of phytochemicals like curcumin, gedunin, quercetin, resveratrol, nobiletin, fisetin, and berberine, targeting their capability as human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, leveraging the PubChem database. Diverse bioinformatics techniques were harnessed to scrutinize molecular docking, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), and adherence to Lipinski's rule of five. Results: Results notably underscored the substantial binding affinities of all ligands with specific amino acid residues within AChE. Remarkably, gedunin exhibited a superior binding affinity (-8.7 kcal/mol) compared to the reference standard. Conclusions: These outcomes accentuate the potential of these seven compounds as viable candidates for oral medication in AD treatment.

LBD falls within an undefined range between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) due to the potential pathogenic synergistic effects of tau, beta-amyloid (A\u03b2), and alpha-synuclein (\u03b1syn). A lack of reliable and relevant animal models hinders the elucidation of the molecular characteristics and phenotypic consequences of these interactions. Here, the goal was to evaluate whether the viral-mediated overexpression of \u03b1syn in adult hTau and APP/PS1 mice or the overexpression of tau in Line 61 hThy1-\u03b1syn mice resulted in pathology and behavior resembling LBD. The transgenes were injected intravenously via the tail vein using AAV-PHP.eB in 3-month-old hThy1-\u03b1syn, hTau, or APP/PS1 mice that were then aged to 6-, 9-, and 12-months-old for subsequent phenotypic and histological characterization. Although we achieved the widespread expression of \u03b1syn in hTau and tau in hThy1-\u03b1syn mice, no \u03b1syn pathology in hTau mice and only mild tau pathology in hThy1-\u03b1syn mice was observed. Additionally, cognitive, motor, and limbic behavior phenotypes were not affected by overexpression of the transgenes. Furthermore, our APP/PS1 mice experienced premature deaths starting at 3 months post-injection (MPI), therefore precluding further analyses at later time points. An evaluation of the remaining 3-MPI indicated no \u03b1syn pathology or cognitive and motor behavioral changes. Taken together, we conclude that the overexpression of \u03b1syn in hTau and APP/PS1 mice and tau in hThy1-\u03b1syn mice does not recapitulate the behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes observed in LBD.",

We developed new facial asymmetry measures to compare Alzheimer's patients with healthy controls. A three-dimensional camera was used to capture facial images, and 68 facial landmarks were identified using an open-source machine-learning algorithm called OpenFace. A standard image registration method was used to align the three-dimensional original and mirrored facial images. This study used the registration error, representing landmark superimposition asymmetry distances, to examine 29 pairs of landmarks to characterize facial asymmetry. After comparing the facial images of 150 patients with AD with those of 150 age- and sex-matched non-demented controls, we found that the asymmetry of 20 landmarks was significantly different in AD than in the controls (p < 0.05). The AD-linked asymmetry was concentrated in the face edge, eyebrows, eyes, nostrils, and mouth. Facial asymmetry evaluation may thus serve as a tool for the detection of AD.",

The main etiology of AD is senile dementia, which is linked to amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deregulation and tau perivascular pathogeny. Hyperphosphorylated tau has a propensity for microtubules, which elevate the instability and tau-protein congregates, leading to accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Tau hyperphosphorylation is susceptible to GSK-3, which has led to an emerging hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of AD. Accordingly, attempts have been made to conduct investigations and achieve further advancements on new analogues capable of inhibiting the GSK-3 protein, which are currently in the clinical trials.

This review aimed to summarize the available information about venular involvement in CAA, starting from the biological level with the putative pathomechanisms of cerebral damage, passing through the definition of the peculiar angioarchitecture of the human cortex with the functional organization and consequences of cortical arteriolar and venular occlusion, and ending to the hypothesized links between cortical venular involvement and the main neuroimaging markers of the disease.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Explainable Vision Transformer with Self-Supervised Learning to Predict Alzheimer's Disease Progression Using 18F-FDG PET.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of AD progression is crucial for early intervention and personalized treatment planning. Although AD does not yet have a reliable therapy, several medications help slow down the disease's progression. However, more study is still needed to develop reliable methods for detecting AD and its phases. In the recent past, biomarkers associated with AD have been identified using neuroimaging methods. To uncover biomarkers, deep learning techniques have quickly emerged as a crucial methodology. A functional molecular imaging technique known as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) has been shown to be effective in assisting researchers in understanding the morphological and neurological alterations to the brain associated with AD. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also long dominated the field of AD progression and have been the subject of substantial research, while more recent approaches like vision transformers (ViT) have not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning (SSL) method to automatically acquire meaningful AD characteristics using the ViT architecture by pretraining the feature extractor using the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) and extreme learning machine (ELM) as classifier models. In this work, we examined a technique for predicting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD utilizing an SSL model which learns powerful representations from unlabeled 18F-FDG PET images, thus reducing the need for large-labeled datasets. In comparison to several earlier approaches, our strategy showed state-of-the-art classification performance in terms of accuracy (92.31%), specificity (90.21%), and sensitivity (95.50%). Then, to make the suggested model easier to understand, we highlighted the brain regions that significantly influence the prediction of MCI development. Our methods offer a precise and efficient strategy for predicting the transition from MCI to AD. In conclusion, this research presents a novel Explainable SSL-ViT model that can accurately predict AD progress based on 18F-FDG PET scans. SSL, attention, and ELM mechanisms are integrated into the model to make it more predictive and interpretable. Future research will enable the development of viable treatments for neurodegenerative disorders by combining brain areas contributing to projection with observed anatomical traits.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning to Predict the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease with 3D Amyloid-PET.",
        "AbstractText": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important task that facilitates the development of treatment and prevention strategies, and may potentially improve patient outcomes. Neuroimaging has shown great promise, including the amyloid-PET, which measures the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain-a hallmark of AD. It is desirable to train end-to-end deep learning models to predict the progression of AD for individuals at early stages based on 3D amyloid-PET. However, commonly used models are trained in a fully supervised learning manner, and they are inevitably biased toward the given label information. To this end, we propose a selfsupervised contrastive learning method to accurately predict the conversion to AD for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with 3D amyloid-PET. The proposed method, SMoCo, uses both labeled and unlabeled data to capture general semantic representations underlying the images. As the downstream task is given as classification of converters vs. non-converters, unlike the general self-supervised learning problem that aims to generate task-agnostic representations, SMoCo additionally utilizes the label information in the pre-training. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The results confirmed that the proposed method is capable of providing appropriate data representations, resulting in accurate classification. SMoCo showed the best classification performance over the existing methods, with AUROC = 85.17%, accuracy = 81.09%, sensitivity = 77.39%, and specificity = 82.17%. While SSL has demonstrated great success in other application domains of computer vision, this study provided the initial investigation of using a proposed self-supervised contrastive learning model, SMoCo, to effectively predict MCI conversion to AD based on 3D amyloid-PET.",

We then summarize the current applications and challenges of DL in PET/MR imaging in AD, and discuss the future directions and opportunities for automated diagnosis, predictions of models, and personalized medicine.

We investigated the effect of cataract surgery on the incidence of dementia in a Korean population aged \u2265 45 years with a previous diagnosis of cataract. This nationwide cohort study was performed using Korean National Health Insurance Service data collected from 2006 to 2017. A total of 300,327 subjects aged \u2265 45 years with a history of cataract diagnosis but no previous diagnosis of dementia were analyzed. The relationship between cataract surgery and dementia was evaluated, applying a time-varying analysis to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values according to dementia. It was calculated via a multivariable Cox regression model, with adjustments for age, sex, visual acuity (VA), ocular and systemic comorbidities, and social factors (including body mass index, income, smoking, and drinking). In the multivariate analysis, the cataract surgery group showed a marginal difference in dementia development (HR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02-1.19]) because both cataract and dementia share common risk factors. However, in the subgroup analysis, men (HR 0.49 [95% CI 0.26-0.90]) and patients under 65 years of age (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.79-0.99]) in the group with cataract surgery and good VA showed a significantly lower incidence of dementia.

However, the results were still controversial. The association between cholesterol levels and incident dementia in older women is not fully understood either. We conducted a retrospective analysis on a cohort of non-demented women aged older than 50 years, which was registered in the History-based Artificial Intelligence Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System database from September 2015 to August 2021. We followed this cohort longitudinally to examine the rates of conversion to dementia. Using a Cox regression model, we investigated the impact of the quartile of total cholesterol (TC) levels on incident dementia, adjusting for age, sex, education, neuropsychiatric symptoms, neuropsychological assessments, HRT, as well as various vascular risk factors and medications. We examined a cohort of 787 participants, comprising 539 (68.5%) individuals who did not develop dementia (non-converters). Among these non-converters, 68 individuals (12.6%) were treated with HRT. By contrast, there were 248 (31.5%) who did develop dementia (converters). Among the converters, 28 individuals (11.3%) were treated with HRT. The average follow-up durations were 2.9 \u00b1 1.5 and 3.3 \u00b1 1.6 years for non-converters and converters, respectively. Compared to the lowest quartile of TC levels (<153), the hazard ratios (HR) for converting to dementia were 0.61, 0.58, and 0.58 for the second (153-176), third (177-201), and highest (>201) quartiles, respectively (all p < 0.05). However, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level and HRT did not alter the rate of conversion to dementia. In conclusion, the lowest quartile of TC increased incident dementia in post-menopausal women without dementia; however, HRT did not contribute to conversion to dementia. Some studies suggest that post-menopausal women who have reduced estrogen levels might have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease if they also have high cholesterol. Nonetheless, the evidence is inconclusive, as not all studies support this finding. The \"Lower LDL-C is better\" strategy for preventing cardiac vascular disease should be re-examined for the possible serial adverse effects of new onset dementia due to very low cholesterol levels.",

        "AbstractText": "Late-life dementia is a growing public health concern lacking effective treatment. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop over a preclinical period of many years beginning in midlife. The prevalence of insulin resistance, a prominent risk factor for late-life dementia, also accelerates in middle-age. Consumption of berry fruits, including strawberries, has been shown to influence metabolism as well as cognitive performance suggesting potential to mitigate risk for dementia. In this controlled trial, we enrolled overweight middle-aged men and women with insulin resistance and subjective cognitive decline and performed a 12-week intervention with daily administration of whole-fruit strawberry powder. Diet records showed that participants in both groups maintained the prescribed abstinence from berry product consumption outside the study. We observed diminished memory interference (p = 0.02; Cohen's f = 0.45) and a reduction of depressive symptoms (p = 0.04; Cohen's f = 0.39) for the strawberry-treated participants; benefits consistent with improved executive ability. However, there was no effect of the intervention on metabolic measures, possibly a consequence of the sample size, length of the intervention, or comparatively low anthocyanin dose. Anti-inflammatory actions of anthocyanins were considered as a primary mechanistic factor. The findings support the notion that strawberry supplementation has a role in dementia risk reduction when introduced in midlife. However, further investigation with longer intervention periods, larger samples, and differing dosing regimens will be required to assess the benefits of strawberry intake with respect to cognition and metabolic function in the context of aging.",

In this study, we investigated the role of nitrite ion, a NO metabolite in a botanical mixture (BM) of fermented garlic, fermented Scutellaria baicalensis, and Rhodiola rosea on neuron loss and cognitive impairment using a VD rat model. The BM containing the NO metabolite alleviated cognitive deficits and enhanced neural plasticity, as reflected by an increase in long-term potentiation. The BM also alleviated neuron apoptosis, decreased GFAP expression, and oxidative stress, and increased parvalbumin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels.

To identify the relevant studies, a thorough search of PubMed, Medline, and Embase was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Out of 5627 articles, 73 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility, which led to the inclusion of 42 studies (26 PD and 16 AD studies). The risk of bias assessment showed a medium risk in 32 studies (20 PD studies and 12 AD studies), a low risk in 9 studies (5 PD studies and 4 AD studies), and 1 PD study with a high risk. Among the PD studies, 22 out of 26 studies reported a different gut microbiota composition between the PD cases and the healthy controls, and 15 out of 16 AD studies reported differences in gut microbiota composition between the AD cases and the healthy controls. The PD and AD studies consistently identified the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria as prevalent in the gut microbiota in both the healthy groups and the case groups. Microbial dysbiosis was specifically characterized in the PD studies by a high abundance of Akkermansia, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae in the cases and a high abundance of Blautia, Coprococcus, Prevotellaceae, and Roseburia in the controls. Similarly, Bacteroides and Acidobacteriota were abundant in the AD cases, and Acidaminococcaceae, Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminiclostridium were abundant in the AD controls. The microbial signature assessment showed the association of several microbial taxa, including Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcacea, and Verrucomicrobia with PD and Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroides, and Actinobacteria with AD. The microbial diversity evaluations in the PD and AD studies indicated comparable alpha diversity in some groups and distinct gut microbiota composition in others, with consistent beta diversity differences between the cases and the controls across multiple studies. The bacterial signatures identified in this study that are associated with PD and AD may offer promising prospects for efficient management and treatment approaches.",

        "AbstractText": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contributes significantly to the death of people worldwide, especially the elderly. An essential feature of COPD is pulmonary inflammation, which results from long-term exposure to noxious substances from cigarette smoking and other environmental pollutants. Pulmonary inflammatory mediators spill over to the blood, leading to systemic inflammation, which is believed to play a significant role in the onset of a host of comorbidities associated with COPD. A substantial comorbidity of concern in COPD patients that is often overlooked in COPD management is cognitive impairment. The exact pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in COPD patients remains a mystery; however, hypoxia, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and cerebral manifestations of these conditions are believed to play crucial roles. Furthermore, the use of medications to treat cognitive impairment symptomatology in COPD patients has been reported to be associated with life-threatening adverse effects, hence the need for alternative medications with reduced side effects. In this Review, we aim to discuss the impact of cognitive impairment in COPD management and the potential mechanisms associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment in COPD patients. The promising roles of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c9-3 PUFAs) in improving cognitive deficits in COPD patients are also discussed. Interestingly, \u03c9-3 PUFAs can potentially enhance the cognitive impairment symptomatology associated with COPD because they can modulate inflammatory processes, activate the antioxidant defence system, and promote amyloid-beta clearance from the brain. Thus, clinical studies are crucial to assess the efficacy of \u03c9-3 PUFAs in managing cognitive impairment in COPD patients.",

Decanoic acid has been shown to be therapeutic in AD. Glutamatergic signaling within neurons and astrocytes of the CA1 region of the hippocampus is critical in cognitive processes, and previous work has indicated deficiencies in this signaling in a mouse model of AD. In this study, we investigated glutamate-mediated signaling by evaluating AMPA-mediated calcium rises in female and male CA1 neurons and astrocytes in a mouse model of AD and examined the potential of decanoic acid to normalize this signaling. In brain slices from 5xFAD mice in which there are five mutations leading to increasing levels of A\u03b242, AMPA-mediated calcium transients in CA1 neurons and astrocytes were significantly lower than that seen in wildtype controls in both females and males. Interestingly, incubation of 5xFAD slices in decanoic acid restored AMPA-mediated calcium levels in neurons and astrocytes in both females and males to levels indistinguishable from those seen in wildtype, whereas similar exposure to decanoic acid did not result in changes in AMPA-mediated transients in neurons or astrocytes in either sex in the wildtype.

The key reasons for the development of such conditions are malfunctioning of various cell organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex, as well as physical and mental disturbances. The nervous system has a relatively high utilization of oxygen, thus making it particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress, which eventually leads to neuronal atrophy and death. This advances the development of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration-associated disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, dementia, and other memory disorders. It is imperative to treat such conditions as early as possible before they worsen and progress to irreversible damage. Oxidative damage can be negated by two mechanisms: improving the cellular defense system or providing exogenous antioxidants. Natural antioxidants can normally handle such oxidative stress, but they have limited efficacy. The valuable features of nanoparticles and/or nanomaterials, in combination with antioxidant features, offer innovative nanotheranostic tools as potential therapeutic modalities.

In this work, 8536 quinoline derivatives, strategically designed using the CADMA-Chem protocol, are presented. This large chemical space was sampled, analyzed and reduced using selection and elimination scores that combine their properties of bioavailability, toxicity and manufacturability. After applying several filters, 25 derivatives were selected to investigate their acid-base, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. The antioxidant activity was predicted based on the ionization potential and bond dissociation energies, parameters directly related to the transfer of hydrogen atoms and of a single electron, respectively. These two mechanisms are typically involved in the radical scavenging processes. The antioxidant efficiency was compared with reference compounds, and the most promising antioxidants were found to be more efficient than Trolox but less efficient than ascorbate. In addition, based on molecular docking simulations, some derivatives are expected to act as inhibitors of catechol-O methyltransferase (COMT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) enzymes.

While oxidative processes have been robustly implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases, the significance of particular antioxidants, both endogenous and especially exogenous, in maintaining redox homeostasis requires further research. Among endogenous antioxidants, enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase are central to disabling free radicals, thereby preventing oxidative damage to cellular lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Whether supplementation with endogenously occurring antioxidant compounds such as melatonin and glutathione carries any benefit, however, remains equivocal. Similarly, while the health benefits of certain exogenous antioxidants, including ascorbic acid (vitamin C), carotenoids, polyphenols, sulforaphanes, and anthocyanins are commonly touted, their clinical efficacy and effectiveness in particular neurological disease contexts need to be more robustly defined.

        "AbstractText": "Neurological disorders (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, have been a threat to human health all over the world. It is of great importance to diagnose ND through combining artificial intelligence technology and brain imaging. A graph neural network (GNN) can model and analyze the brain, imaging from morphology, anatomical structure, function features, and other aspects, thus becoming one of the best deep learning models in the diagnosis of ND. Some researchers have investigated the application of GNN in the medical field, but the scope is broad, and its application to NDs is less frequent and not detailed enough. This review focuses on the research progress of GNNs in the diagnosis of ND. Firstly, we systematically investigated the GNN framework of ND, including graph construction, graph convolution, graph pooling, and graph prediction. Secondly, we investigated common NDs using the GNN diagnostic model in terms of data modality, number of subjects, and diagnostic accuracy. Thirdly, we discussed some research challenges and future research directions. The results of this review may be a valuable contribution to the ongoing intersection of artificial intelligence technology and brain imaging.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Alteration of Metabolic Profiles during the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "AbstractText": "(1) Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that threatens the population health of older adults. However, the mechanisms of the altered metabolism involved in AD pathology are poorly understood. The aim of the study was to identify the potential biomarkers of AD and discover the metabolomic changes produced during the progression of the disease. (2) Methods: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to measure the concentrations of the serum metabolites in a cohort of subjects with AD (n = 88) and a cognitively normal control (CN) group (n = 85). The patients were classified as very mild (n = 25), mild (n = 27), moderate (n = 25), and severe (n = 11). The serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using multivariate and univariate approaches. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to identify the potential biomarkers of AD. Biofunctional enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. (3) Results: Our results revealed considerable separation between the AD and CN groups. Six metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of AD (AUC > 0.85), and the diagnostic model of three metabolites could predict the risk of AD with high accuracy (AUC = 0.984). The metabolic enrichment analysis revealed that carbohydrate metabolism deficiency and the disturbance of amino acid, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism were involved in AD progression. Especially, the pathway analysis highlighted that l-glutamate participated in four crucial nervous system pathways (including the GABAergic synapse, the glutamatergic synapse, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, and the synaptic vesicle cycle). (4) Conclusions: Carbohydrate metabolism deficiency and amino acid dysregulation, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism disorders were pivotal events in AD progression. Our study may provide novel insights into the role of metabolic disorders in AD pathogenesis and identify new markers for AD diagnosis.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The Connection between Chronic Liver Damage and Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease: Evidence and Insights from a Rat Model.",
        "AbstractText": "Junk foods are typically low in essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are also loaded with trans fats and saturated fats, which can increase the level of triglycerides in the blood. High triglyceride levels can contribute to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver. A high intake of junk foods can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin. A diet lacking in nutrients and loaded with unwanted toxins can impair the liver's ability to detoxify harmful substances and damage its overall function. It is known that the regular consumption of junk food can be linked to memory impairment and cognitive decline. Several studies have shown that diets high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and processed foods can negatively impact brain health, including memory function. In this study, Wistar rats were used to model Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD), which was inspired by knowledge of the liver-brain axis's role in causing dementia. The model mimicked junk-food-induced liver-brain damage, and was developed by using the toxins d-galactosamine, ethanol and d-galactose. To begin with, the model rats demonstrated insulin resistance, a characteristic of LOAD patients. Glucose levels in both the brain and liver tissues were significantly elevated in the model, paralleling clinical findings in LOAD patients. High glucose levels in the brain lead to the increased production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which, along with amyloid beta, harm neighbouring neurons. Histopathological analysis revealed deformed glial nodules, apoptotic neurons, and amyloid plaques in the brain section in the later stages of the disease. Simultaneously, the liver section displayed features of cirrhosis, including an effaced lobular architecture and the extravasation of red blood cells. Liver enzymes ALT, AST and ALP were consistently elevated with disease progression. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the diseased brain. The positive expression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 3-Alpha (HIF3A) in the brain indicated hypoxic conditions, which is consistent with other LOAD studies. This model also exhibited damaged intestinal villi and excessive bowel and urinary incontinence, indicating malnutrition and a disturbed gut microbiome, which is also consistent with LOAD patients. Bioinformatics analysis on serum protein suggests a few affected molecular pathways, like the amyloid secretase pathway, androgen/oestrogen/progesterone biosynthesis, the apoptosis signalling pathway, the insulin/IGF pathway-protein kinase B signalling cascade, the Metabotropic glutamate receptor group I pathway, the Wnt signalling pathway, etc. Behavioural analysis confirmed memory decline and the loss of muscle strength with disease progression. Overall, this rat model of LOAD sheds valuable light on LOAD pathology and highlights the potential link between liver dysfunction, particularly induced by the excessive consumption of junk food, and LOAD. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in LOAD, paving the way for new possibilities in therapeutic interventions.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The Interplay between Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Ferroptosis during Ischemia-Associated Central Nervous System Diseases.",
        "AbstractText": "Cerebral ischemia, a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide, triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular pathologies linked to several central nervous system (CNS) disorders. These disorders primarily encompass ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, and other CNS conditions. Despite substantial progress in understanding and treating the underlying pathological processes in various neurological diseases, there is still a notable absence of effective therapeutic approaches aimed specifically at mitigating the damage caused by these illnesses. Remarkably, ischemia causes severe damage to cells in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. Cerebral ischemia initiates oxygen and glucose deprivation, which subsequently promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, mitophagy dysfunction, and excessive mitochondrial fission, triggering various forms of cell death such as autophagy, apoptosis, as well as ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, a novel type of regulated cell death (RCD), is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis both play critical roles in the pathogenic progression of ischemia-associated CNS diseases. In recent years, growing evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction interplays with ferroptosis to aggravate cerebral ischemia injury. However, the potential connections between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in cerebral ischemia have not yet been clarified. Thus, we analyzed the underlying mechanism between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. We also discovered that GSH depletion and GPX4 inactivation cause lipoxygenase activation and calcium influx following cerebral ischemia injury, resulting in MPTP opening and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, dysfunction in mitochondrial electron transport and an imbalanced fusion-to-fission ratio can lead to the accumulation of ROS and iron overload, which further contribute to the occurrence of ferroptosis. This creates a vicious cycle that continuously worsens cerebral ischemia injury. In this study, our focus is on exploring the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis, which may offer new insights into potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ischemia-associated CNS diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "The pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is particularly complicated, and early diagnosis and course monitoring of the disease are not ideal based on the available core biomarkers. As a biomarker closely related to neuroinflammation, YKL-40 provides a potential scalable approach in AD, but its association remains controversial and inconclusive with AD. We conducted this study to assess the utility of YKL-40 levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) by meta-analysis. We systematically searched and screened relevant trials for comparing YKL-40 levels between AD patients and HCs in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a search deadline of 14 March 2023 for each database. A total of 17 eligible and relevant studies involving 1811 subjects, including 949 AD patients and 862 HCs, were included. The results showed that YKL-40 levels in the peripheral blood of AD patients and HCs did not possess significant differences. Subgroup analysis showed YKL-40 significantly differed in plasma (SMD = 0.527, 95%CI: [0.302, 0.752]; p = 0.000), but did not in serum. In the case of comparison with HCs, YKL-40 was significantly higher in CSF of AD patients (SMD = 0.893, 95%CI: [0.665, 1.121]; p = 0.000). Besides that, when we performed a combined analysis of total YKL-40 in both peripheral blood and CSF, overall YKL-40 concentrations were also significantly increased among AD patients (SMD = 0.608, 95%CI: [0.272, 0.943]; p = 0.000). YKL-40 provides support and rationale for the neuroinflammatory pathogenesis of AD. The significance of CSF levels of YKL-40 for early screening of AD is definite. Plasma levels of YKL-40 also appear to assist in discriminating AD patients from HCs, which facilitates early screening and monitoring of the natural course of AD.",

Epigenetic studies may help identify molecular signatures of IR associated with AD, thus improving our understanding of the biological and regulatory mechanisms linking IR and AD. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of IR, quantified using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and adjusted for body mass index, in 3,167 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) without type 2 diabetes at the time of blood draw used for methylation measurement. We identified DNA methylation markers associated with IR at the genome-wide level accounting for multiple testing (P\u2009<\u20091.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7) and evaluated their association with neurological traits in participants from the FHS (N\u2009=\u20093040) and the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP, N\u2009=\u2009707). DNA methylation profiles were measured in blood (FHS) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (ROSMAP) using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear regressions (ROSMAP) or mixed-effects models accounting for familial relatedness (FHS) adjusted for age, sex, cohort, self-reported\u00a0race, batch, and cell type proportions were used to assess associations between DNA methylation and neurological traits accounting for multiple testing. We confirmed the strong association of blood DNA methylation with IR at three loci (cg17901584-DHCR24, cg17058475-CPT1A, cg00574958-CPT1A, and cg06500161-ABCG1). In FHS, higher levels of blood DNA methylation at cg00574958 and cg17058475 were both associated with lower IR (P\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910-11 and P\u2009=\u20099.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8), larger total brain volumes (P\u2009=\u20090.03 and P\u2009=\u20099.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4), and smaller log lateral ventricular volumes (P\u2009=\u20090.07 and P\u2009=\u20090.03). In ROSMAP, higher levels of brain DNA methylation at the same two CPT1A markers were associated with greater risk of cognitive impairment (P\u2009=\u20090.005 and P\u2009=\u20090.02) and higher AD-related indices (CERAD score: P\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4 and 0.001; Braak stage: P\u2009=\u20090.004 and P\u2009=\u20090.01).

Using detergent-insoluble tau isolated from Alzheimer's disease (AD-tau) or Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP-tau) patients, we provide insights into whether phosphorylation of critical residues determine templated tau seeding. Our initial data with phosphorylation-ablating mutations (Ser/Thr\u2009\u2192\u2009Ala) on select sites of P301L tau showed no changes in seeding efficacy by AD-tau or PSP-tau. Interestingly, when specific sites in the R1-R2 repeat domains (Ser262/Thr263/Ser289/Ser305) were mutated to phosphorylation-mimicking amino acid Glu, it substantially reduced the seeding efficiency of AD-tau, but not PSP-tau seeds. The resultant detergent-insoluble tau shows deficient phosphorylation on AT8, AT100, AT180 and PHF1 epitopes, indicating inter-domain cooperativity. We further identify Ser305 as a critical determinant of AD-tau-specific seeding, whereby the phospho-mimicking Ser305Glu tau abrogates seeding by AD-tau but not PSP-tau. This suggests that phosphorylation on Ser305 could be related to the formation of disease-specific tau strains. Our results highlight the existence of a phospho-PTM code in tau seeding and further demonstrate the distinctive nature of this code in 4R tauopathies.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the main cause for dementia. The irreversible neurodegeneration leads to a gradual loss of brain function characterized predominantly by memory loss. Cerebrovascular changes are common neuropathologic findings in aged subjects with dementia. Cerebrovascular integrity is critical for proper metabolism and perfusion of the brain, as cerebrovascular remodeling may render the brain more susceptible to pulse pressure and may be associated with poorer cognitive performance and greater risk of cerebrovascular events. The objective of this study is to provide understanding of cerebrovascular remodeling with AD progression. Anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) from a total of 19 brain donor participants from controls and pathologically diagnosed AD groups (early-Braak stages I-II; intermediate-Braak stages III-IV; and advanced-Braak stages V-VI) were included in this study. Mechanical testing, histology, advanced optical imaging, and mass spectrometry were performed to study the progressive structural and functional changes of ACAs with AD progression. Biaxial extension-inflation tests showed that ACAs became progressively less compliant, and the longitudinal stress in the intermediate and advanced AD groups was significantly higher than that from the control group. With pathological AD development, the inner and outer diameters of the\u00a0ACAs remained almost unchanged; however, histology study revealed progressive smooth muscle cell atrophy and loss of elastic fibers which led to compromised structural integrity of the arterial wall. Multiphoton imaging demonstrated elastin degradation at the media-adventitia interface, which led to the formation of an empty band of 21.0\u2009\u00b1\u200915.4\u00a0\u03bcm and 32.8\u2009\u00b1\u20099.24\u00a0\u03bcm in width for the intermediate and advanced AD groups, respectively. Furthermore, quantitative birefringence microscopy showed disorganized adventitial collagen with AD development. Mass spectrometry analysis provided further evidence of altered collagen content and other extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule and smooth muscle cell changes that were consistent with the mechanical and structural alterations. Collectively, our study provides understanding of the mechanical and structural cerebrovascular deterioration in cerebral arteries with AD, which may be related to neurodegenration and pathology in the brain.",

Thus far, no studies have specifically investigated the relationship between pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and autophagy, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study used in vitro and in vivo models, along with clinical samples, to explore interactions between PACAP and autophagy in AD. AD model mice were administered 6\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.1\u00a0mg/ml PACAP liquid intranasally for 4\u00a0weeks, then subjected to behavioral analyses to assess the benefits of PACAP treatment. The underlying mechanisms of PACAP-induced effects were investigated by methods including real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Exosomes were extracted from human serum and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to examine autophagy pathways. The clinical and therapeutic implications of PACAP and autophagy were extensively investigated throughout the experiment. Impaired autophagy was a critical step in amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) and Tau deposition; PACAP enhanced autophagy and attenuated cognitive impairment. RNA sequencing revealed three pathways that may be involved in AD progression: PI3K-AKT, mTOR, and AMPK. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that sirtuin3 knockdown diminished the ability of PACAP to restore normal autophagy function, resulting in phagocytosis dysregulation and the accumulation of pTau, Tau, and A\u03b2. Additionally, the autophagic biomarker MAP1LC3 demonstrated a positive association with PACAP in human serum. PACAP reverses AD-induced cognitive impairment through autophagy, using sirtuin3 as a key mediator. MAP1LC3 has a positive relationship with PACAP in humans. These findings provide insights regarding potential uses of intranasal PACAP and sirtuin3 agonists in AD treatment. NCT04320368.",

It was reported that liensinine and neferine could inhibit the activities of acetylcholinesterase and cross the blood-brain barriers, suggesting their therapeutic potential for the management of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we employed SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with the human Swedish amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation APP695 (APP695swe SH-SY5Y) as an in vitro model and transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo model to investigate the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanism of liensinine and neferine. We found that liensinine and neferine could significantly improve the viability and reduce ROS levels in APP695swe SH-SY5Y cells, inhibit \u03b2-amyloid and tau-induced toxicity, and enhance stress resistance in nematodes. Moreover, liensinine and neferine had obviously neuroprotective effects by assaying chemotaxis, 5-hydroxytryptamine sensitivity and the integrity of injured neurons in nematodes. Preliminary mechanism studies revealed that liensinine and neferine could upregulate the expression of autophagy related genes (lgg-1, unc-51, pha-4, atg-9 and ced-9) and reduce the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid induced autophagosomes, which suggested autophagy pathway played a key role in neuroprotective effects of these two alkaloids.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2). It affects cognition and leads to memory impairment. The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) plays an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and has been implicated in several neuronal disorders or neuronal injuries. Ligands targeting the mitochondrial translocator protein (18\u2009kDa), promote neurosteroidogenesis and may be neuroprotective. To study whether the TSPO ligand XBD173 may exert early neuroprotective effects in AD pathology we investigated the impact of XBD173 on amyloid toxicity and neuroplasticity in mouse models of AD. We show that XBD173 (emapunil), via neurosteroid-mediated signaling and delta subunit-containing GABAA receptors, prevents the neurotoxic effect of A\u03b2 on long-term potentiation (CA1-LTP) in the hippocampus and prevents the loss of spines. Chronic but not acute administration of XBD173 ameliorates spatial learning deficits in transgenic AD mice with arctic mutation (ArcA\u03b2). The heterozygous TSPO-knockout crossed with the transgenic arctic mutation model of AD mice (het TSPOKO X ArcA\u03b2) treated with XBD173 does not show this improvement in spatial learning suggesting TSPO is needed for procognitive effects of XBD173. The neuroprotective profile of XBD173 in AD pathology is further supported by a reduction in plaques and soluble A\u03b2 levels in the cortex, increased synthesis of neurosteroids, rescued spine density, reduction of complement protein C1q deposits, and reduced astrocytic phagocytosis of functional synapses both in the hippocampus and cortex.

Cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease has been associated with the localization of the microtubule-associated protein Tau at the postsynapse.

Here, we show that Tau arrests liquid-like droplets formed by the four postsynaptic density proteins PSD-95, GKAP, Shank, Homer in solution, as well as NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor-associated protein clusters on synthetic membranes. Tau-mediated condensate/cluster arrest critically depends on the binding of multiple interaction motifs of Tau to a canonical GMP-binding pocket in the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95. We further reveal that competitive binding of a high-affinity phosphorylated peptide to PSD-95 rescues the diffusional dynamics of an NMDA truncated construct, which contains the last five amino acids of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B fused to the C-terminus of the tetrameric GCN4 coiled-coil domain, in postsynaptic density-like condensates/clusters.

The present study focuses on biochemical and biophysical analysis and characterization of twenty-four human miPs using distinct computational methods, including RIDAO, AlphaFold2, D2P2, FuzDrop, STRING, and Emboss Pep wheel. miPs often lack well-defined tertiary structures and may harbor intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that play pivotal roles in cellular functions. Our analyses define the physicochemical properties of an essential subset of miPs, elucidating their structural characteristics and demonstrating their propensity for driving or participating in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and intracellular condensate formation. Notably, miPs such as NoBody and pTUNAR revealed a high propensity for LLPS, implicating their potential involvement in forming membrane-less organelles (MLOs) during intracellular LLPS and condensate formation. The results of our study indicate that miPs have functionally profound implications in cellular compartmentalization and signaling processes essential for regulating normal cellular functions. Taken together, our methodological approach explains and highlights the biological importance of these miPs, providing a deeper understanding of the unusual structural landscape and functionality of these newly defined small proteins.

        "AbstractText": "Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a frequently observed underlying pathology of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), which is a common consequence of cerebral blood flow (CBF) dysregulation. Synaptic damage has been proven as a crucial causative factor for CCH-related cognitive impairment. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective impact of environmental enrichment (EE) intervention on CCH-induced synaptic destruction and the consequent cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of this neuroprotective effect was explored to provide new insights into therapeutic interventions for individuals suffering from AD or VD. In this experiment, all rats were initially acclimatized to a standard environment (SE) for a period of one week. On the seventh day, rats underwent either bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) surgery or sham surgery (Sham) before being subjected to a four-week procedure of exposure to an EE, except for the control group. During the EE or SE procedure, intraperitoneal injection of chloroquine (CQ) into rats was performed once daily for four weeks. Following this, cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The synapse ultrastructure was subsequently observed using transmission electron microscopy. Expression levels of autophagy-related proteins (LC3, LAMP1, and P62) and synapse-related proteins (Synapsin I and PSD-95) were detected through Western blotting. Finally, immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression levels of Synapsin I and PSD-95 and the colocalization of LAMP-1 and LC3 in the hippocampus. After undergoing 2VO, rats exposed to SE exhibited cognitive impairment, autophagic dysfunction, and synapse damage. The synapse damage was evidenced by ultrastructural damage and degradation of synapse-related proteins. However, these effects were significantly mitigated by exposure to an EE intervention. Moreover, the intervention led to an improvement in autophagic dysfunction. The study found that EE had a positive impact on CCH-induced synaptic damage. Specifically, EE was found to increase synaptic plasticity-associated proteins and postsynaptic density thickness, while decreasing synaptic space. This multifaceted effect resulted in an amelioration of CCH-induced cognitive impairment. It was shown that this beneficial outcome was mediated via the activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Overall, the findings suggest that EE may have a therapeutic potential for cognitive impairments associated with CCH through autophagy-mediated synaptic improvement.",

Among the various genetic factors associated with AD, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid transporter, stands out as the primary genetic risk factor. Specifically, individuals carrying the ApoE4 allele exhibit a significantly higher risk. However, emerging research indicates that dietary factors play a prominent role in modifying the risk of AD. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a prominent \u03c9-3 fatty acid, has garnered considerable attention for its potential to ameliorate cognitive function. The intricate interplay between DHA and the ApoE genotype within the brain, which may influence DHA's utilization and functionality, warrants further investigation. This review meticulously examines experimental and clinical studies exploring the effects of DHA on cognitive decline. Special emphasis is placed on elucidating the role of ApoE gene polymorphism and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. These studies suggest that early DHA supplementation may confer benefits to cognitively normal older adults carrying the ApoE4 gene. However, once AD develops, ApoE4 non-carriers may experience greater benefits compared to ApoE4 carriers, although the overall effectiveness of DHA supplementation at this stage is limited. Potential mechanisms underlying these differential effects may include accelerated DHA catabolism in ApoE4 carriers, impaired transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and compromised lipidation and circulatory function in ApoE4 carriers. Thus, the supplementation of DHA may represent a potential intervention strategy aimed at compensating for these deficiencies in ApoE4 carriers prior to the onset of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by triplication of human chromosome 21. In addition to intellectual disability, DS is defined by a premature aging phenotype and Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, including septohippocampal circuit vulnerability and degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). The Ts65Dn mouse model recapitulates key aspects of DS/AD pathology, namely age-associated atrophy of BFCNs and cognitive decline in septohippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks. We investigated whether maternal choline supplementation (MCS), a well-tolerated treatment modality, protects vulnerable BFCNs from age- and genotype-associated degeneration in trisomic offspring. We also examined the effect of trisomy, and MCS, on GABAergic basal forebrain parvalbumin neurons (BFPNs), an unexplored neuronal population in this DS model. Unbiased stereological analyses of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive BFCNs and parvalbumin-immunoreactive BFPNs were conducted using confocal z-stacks of the medial septal nucleus and the vertical limb of the diagonal band (MSN/VDB) in Ts65Dn mice and disomic (2N) littermates at 3-4 and 10-12\u00a0months of age. MCS trisomic offspring displayed significant increases in ChAT-immunoreactive neuron number and density compared to unsupplemented counterparts, as well as increases in the area of the MSN/VDB occupied by ChAT-immunoreactive neuropil. MCS also rescued BFPN number and density in Ts65Dn offspring, a novel rescue of a non-cholinergic cell population. Furthermore, MCS prevented age-associated loss of BFCNs and MSN/VDB regional area in 2N offspring, indicating genotype-independent neuroprotective benefits. These findings demonstrate MCS provides neuroprotection of vulnerable BFCNs and non-cholinergic septohippocampal BFPNs, indicating this modality has translational value as an early life therapy for DS, as well as extending benefits to the aging population at large.",

We aimed to develop automated brain health risk scores calculated from data in the electronic health record (EHR) enabling population-wide brain health screening in advance of patient care visits. This retrospective cohort study included patients with visits to an outpatient neurology clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital, between January 2010 and March 2021. Survival analysis with an 11-year follow-up period was performed to predict the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, depression, death and composite outcome of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment. Variables included age, sex, vital signs, laboratory values, employment status and social covariates pertaining to marital, tobacco and alcohol status. Random sampling was performed to create a training (70%) set for hyperparameter tuning in internal 5-fold cross validation and an external hold-out testing (30%) set of patients, both stratified by age. Risk ratios for high and low risk groups were evaluated in the hold-out test set, using 1000 bootstrapping iterations to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CI). The cohort comprised 17,040 patients with an average age of 49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.6\u00a0years; majority were males (57\u00a0%), White (78\u00a0%) and non-Hispanic (80\u00a0%). The low and high groups average risk ratios [95\u00a0% CI] were: intracranial hemorrhage 0.46 [0.45-0.48] and 2.07 [1.95-2.20], ischemic stroke 0.57 [0.57-0.59] and 1.64 [1.52-1.69], depression 0.68 [0.39-0.74] and 1.29 [0.78-1.38], composite of dementia 0.27 [0.26-0.28] and 3.52 [3.18-3.81] and death 0.24 [0.24-0.24] and 3.96 [3.91-4.00]. Simple risk scores derived from routinely collected EHR accurately quantify the risk of developing common neurologic and psychiatric diseases. These scores can be computed automatically, prior to medical care visits, and may thus be useful for large-scale brain health screening.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly associated with self-aggregation of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) proteins into fibrils. Inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregation by polyphenols is one of the major therapeutic strategies for AD. Among them, four polyphenols (brazilin, resveratrol, hematoxylin, and rosmarinic acid) have been reported to be effective at inhibiting A\u03b2 aggregation, but the inhibition mechanisms are still unclear. In this work, these four polyphenols were selected to explore their interactions with the A\u03b217-42 pentamer by molecular dynamics simulation. All four polyphenols can bind to the pentamer tightly but prefer different binding sites. Conversion of the \u03b2-sheet to the random coil, fewer interchain hydrogen bonds, and weaker salt bridges were observed after binding. Interestingly, different A\u03b217-42 pentamer destabilizing mechanisms for resveratrol and hematoxylin were found. Resveratrol inserts into the hydrophobic core of the pentamer by forming hydrogen bonds with Asp23 and Lys28, while hematoxylin prefers to bind beside chain A of the pentamer, which leads to \u03b2-sheet offset and dissociation of the \u03b21 sheet of chain E. This work reveals the interactions between the A\u03b217-42 pentamer and four polyphenols and discusses the relationship between inhibitor structures and their inhibition mechanisms, which also provides useful guidance for screening effective A\u03b2 aggregation inhibitors and drug design against AD.",

Sarkosyl-insoluble-proteomic analyses of the CKD mouse hippocampus revealed an accumulation of insoluble MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) and RNA-binding proteins such as small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1 subunit 70 (SNRNP70). Additionally, there was an accumulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown.

Recently, studies suggested that R1 obtained from different tracers could be used interchangeably and is irrespective of target tissue. However, the similarities or differences of R1 obtained from different PET tracers still require validation. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to compare R1 estimates, derived from dynamic [18F]florbetapir (amyloid) and [18F]flortaucipir (tau) PET, in the same subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Voxel-wise analysis presented a small cluster (1.6% of the whole brain) with higher R1 values for [18F]flortaucipir compared to [18F]florbetapir in the A\u03b2-negative group. These voxels were part of the hippocampus and the left middle occipital gyrus. In part of the thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum, voxels (2.5% of the whole brain) with higher R1 values for [18F]florbetapir were observed. In the A\u03b2-positive group, a cluster (0.2% of the whole brain) of higher R1 values was observed in part of the hippocampus, right parahippocampal gyrus and in the left sagittal stratum for [18F]flortaucipir compared to [18F]florbetapir. Furthermore, in part of the thalamus, left amygdala, midbrain and right parahippocampal gyrus voxels (0.4% of the whole brain) with higher R1 values for [18F]florbetapir were observed. Despite these differences, [18F]florbetapir R1 had high correspondence with [18F]flortaucipir R1 across all regions of interest (ROIs) and subjects (A\u03b2-:r2\u2009=\u20090.79, slope\u2009=\u20090.85, ICC\u2009=\u20090.76; A\u03b2+: r2\u2009=\u20090.87, slope\u2009=\u20090.93, ICC\u2009=\u20090.77).

        "AbstractText": "Multimodal neuroimaging has gained traction in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis by integrating information from multiple imaging modalities to enhance classification accuracy. However, effectively handling heterogeneous data sources and overcoming the challenges posed by multiscale transform methods remains a significant hurdle. This article proposes a novel approach to address these challenges. To harness the power of diverse neuroimaging data, we employ a strategy that leverages optimized convolution techniques. These optimizations include varying kernel sizes and the incorporation of instance normalization, both of which play crucial roles in feature extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Specifically, varying kernel sizes allow us to adapt the receptive field to different image characteristics, enhancing the model's ability to capture relevant information. Furthermore, we employ transposed convolution, which increases spatial resolution of feature maps, and it is optimized with varying kernel sizes and instance normalization. This heightened resolution facilitates the alignment and integration of data from disparate MRI and PET data. The use of larger kernels and strides in transposed convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to capture essential cross-modal relationships. Instance normalization, applied to each modality during the fusion process, mitigates potential biases stemming from differences in intensity, contrast, or scale between modalities. This enhancement contributes to improved model performance by reducing complexity and ensuring robust fusion. The performance of the proposed fusion method is assessed on three distinct neuroimaging datasets, which include: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD, and Early Mild Cognitive); Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, Mild Dementia, Very Mild Dementia); and whole-brain atlas neuroimaging (AANLIB) (consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD). To evaluate the quality of the fused images generated via our method, we employ a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM), which assesses the structural similarity between two images; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which measures how closely the generated image resembles the ground truth; Entropy (E), which assesses the amount of information preserved or lost during fusion; the Feature Similarity Indexing Method (FSIM), which assesses the structural and feature similarities between two images; and Edge-Based Similarity (EBS), which measures the similarity of edges between the fused and ground truth images. The obtained fused image is further evaluated using a Mobile Vision Transformer. In the classification of AD vs. Cognitive Normal, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.00%, specificity of 99.00%, and sensitivity of 98.44% on the AANLIB dataset.",

        "AbstractText": "The prevalence of dementia among the elderly is high, and it is the leading cause of death globally. However, the relationship between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk has produced inconsistent results, necessitating an updated review of the evidence. To address this, we conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize the available evidence on the association between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk and evaluate its credibility. We systematically evaluated the meta-analyses of observational studies that examined the connection between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk. For each meta-analysis, we collected the overall effect size, heterogeneity, risk of bias, and year of the most recent article and graded the evidence based on pre-specified criteria. We also used AMSTAR, a measurement tool to evaluate systematic reviews, to assess the methodological quality of each study. Our review included five meta-analyses encompassing 30 studies, and the effect size of the association between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk ranged from 1.38 to 1.78. Nonetheless, the evidence supporting this relationship was weak, and the methodological quality of the studies included was low. In conclusion, our findings revealed limited evidence of a link between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk, and more research is required to determine a causal connection. Physicians should only prescribe benzodiazepine for appropriate indications.",

It was hypothesized that individuals with EOMCI will preserve their cognitive functions to a greater extent as compared to individuals with LOMCI, even after adjusting the cognitive performance for age and education through the use of published Greek norms. The level of cognitive decline concerning MOMCI was evaluated for extracting more precise conclusions regarding the impact of the age of onset on the patterns of MCI symptomatology. The analyses of data were conducted in a Greek population of individuals with MCI, who were consecutive visitors of the Outpatient Memory Clinic of Nestor Alzheimer's Centre in Athens, Greece. The sample consisted of 297 participants who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: MCI diagnosis based on Petersen's criteria, Greek mother language, and absence of a psychiatric history or chronic and incurable organic disease. The overall results support the presence of a cognitive advantage of the EOMCI group compared to the LOMCI group. In the MOMCI group, cognitive performance displayed a tendency to remain intermediate compared to the other two groups. Nonetheless, significant differences were observed when this group was compared with the LOMCI group. The current findings indicate that the age of onset should be taken under consideration in the neuropsychological assessment of individuals with MCI. The specific parameters could have implications in terms of prognosis as well as the design and implementation of tailored interventions.",

        "AbstractText": "Since the proposal of the brainstem axis theory, increasing research attention has been paid to the interactions between bacterial amyloids produced by intestinal flora and the amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and it has been considered as the possible cause of AD. Therefore, phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) \u03b13, the most virulent protein secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, has attracted much attention. In this work, the effect of PSM\u03b13 with a unique cross-\u03b1 fibril architecture on the aggregation of pathogenic A\u03b240 of AD was studied by extensive biophysical characterizations. The results proposed that the PSM\u03b13 monomer inhibited the aggregation of A\u03b240 in a concentration-dependent manner and changed the aggregation pathway to form granular aggregates. However, PSM\u03b13 oligomers promoted the generation of the \u03b2-sheet structure, thus shortening the lag phase of A\u03b240 aggregation. Moreover, the higher the cross-\u03b1 content of PSM\u03b13, the stronger the effect of the promotion, indicating that the cross-\u03b1 structure of PSM\u03b13 plays a crucial role in the aggregation of A\u03b240. Further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that the Met1-Gly20 region in the PSM\u03b13 monomer can be combined with the Asp1-Ala2 and His13-Val36 regions in the A\u03b240 monomer by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, which prevents the conformational conversion of A\u03b240 from the \u03b1-helix to \u03b2-sheet structure. By contrast, PSM\u03b13 oligomers mainly combined with the central hydrophobic core (CHC) and the C-terminal region of the A\u03b240 monomer by weak H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, which could not inhibit the transition to the \u03b2-sheet structure in the aggregation pathway. Thus, the research has unraveled molecular interactions between A\u03b240 and PSM\u03b13 of different structures and provided a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between bacterial amyloids and AD-related pathogenic A\u03b2.",

A randomized trial was conducted, initially recruiting 51 participants aged 65 and above from the Greek Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders in Thessaloniki, Greece. The study employed a control-experimental group setup. To ensure randomization, each participant was assigned a unique number, and a random number generator was used for group allocation. A total of 41 eligible participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were included in the study after screening. The intervention consisted of a 3-week positive psychology program (PPI) where the PERMA Profiler questionnaire was administered at three intervals: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and one month after completion. The subjective well-being of participants. The analysis, conducted mainly through mixed-measures ANOVAs, supported the study's hypotheses, revealing that the 3-week PPI led to increased PERMA model scores and overall well-being, which persisted even after one month. Conversely, non-participants experienced declines in most domains except for Positive Emotion and Meaning, which demonstrated improvement and recovery during follow-up. These findings suggest the potential of PPI in enhancing the subjective well-being of older adults with amnestic MCI, with implications for addressing dementia-related challenges. Further investigation is warranted to pinpoint PPI effects on MCI and tailor interventions for improved subjective well-being.",

We expected that people with advanced MCI would perceive increased negative psychological outcomes, poorer psychological resilience, and lower levels of subjective wellbeing in contrast to early MCI and healthy participants. The study involved 30 healthy, 31 early, and 28 late MCI individuals. A series of questionnaires have been applied to assess the aforementioned constructs. To examine the hypotheses of the study, path analysis (EQS program) was applied. Results showed that early MCI persons maintain the same levels of positive emotions and feelings of accomplishment with healthy peers. Late-stage patients present those feelings in a diminished form, which adversely impacts psychological resilience. Individuals with early and late MCI exhibit negative emotions and stress that impact their resilience; however, those with early MCI experience greater stress, negative emotions, depression, and anxiety.

Mutations in the compact myelin protein gene pmp22 cause more than 50% of all CMTs. CMT1E is a subtype of CMT1 myelinopathy carrying micro-mutations in pmp22. The Trembler-J mice have a spontaneous mutation in pmp22 identical to that present in CMT1E human patients. PMP22 is mainly (but not exclusively) expressed in Schwann cells. Some studies have found the presence of pmp22 together with some anomalies in the CNS of CMT patients. Recently, we identified the presence of higher hippocampal pmp22 expression and elevated levels of anxious behavior in TrJ/+ compared to those observed in wt. In the present paper, we delve deeper into the central expression of the neuropathy modeled in Trembler-J analyzing in vivo the cerebrovascular component by Ultrafast Doppler, exploring the vascular structure by scanning laser confocal microscopy, and analyzing the behavioral profile by anxiety and motor difficulty tests. We have found that TrJ/+ hippocampi have increased blood flow and a higher vessel volume compared with the wild type. Together with this, we found an anxiety-like profile in TrJ/+ and the motor difficulties described earlier.

Among the areas that have shown immense potential in research, tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) have emerged as a promising subject of study. These minute structures act as conduits for the transfer of cellular materials between cells, representing a mechanism of communication that holds great significance. In particular, the interplay facilitated by TNTs among various cell types within the brain, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, glial cells, and microglia, can be essential for the normal development and optimal functioning of this complex organ. The involvement of TNTs in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease, has attracted significant attention. These disorders are characterized by the progressive degeneration of neurons and the subsequent decline in brain function. Studies have predicted that TNTs likely play critical roles in the propagation and spread of pathological factors, contributing to the advancement of these diseases. Thus, there is a growing interest in understanding the precise functions and mechanisms of TNTs within the nervous system. This review article, based on our recent work on Rhes-mediated TNTs, aims to explore the functions of TNTs within the brain and investigate their implications for neurodegenerative diseases. Using the knowledge gained from studying TNTs could offer novel opportunities for designing targeted treatments that can stop the progression of neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Telomeres are structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that help maintain genomic stability. During aging, telomere length gradually shortens, producing short telomeres, which are markers of premature cellular senescence. This may contribute to age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and based on this, several studies have hypothesized that telomere shortening may characterize AD. Current research, however, has been inconclusive regarding the direction of the association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and disease risk. We assessed the association between LTL and AD in a retrospective case-control study of a sample of 255 unrelated patients with late-onset AD (LOAD), including 120 sporadic cases and 135 with positive family history for LOAD, and a group of 279 cognitively healthy unrelated controls, who were all from Calabria, a southern Italian region. Following regression analysis, telomeres were found significantly shorter in LOAD cases than in controls (48% and 41% decrease for sporadic and familial cases, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Interestingly, LTL was associated with disease risk independently of the presence of conventional risk factors (e.g., age, sex, MMSE scores, and the presence of the APOE-\u03b54 allele). Altogether, our findings lend support to the notion that LTL shortening may be an indicator of the pathogenesis of LOAD.",

In this study, we utilized stereotactic delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-DUSP4 to overexpress DUSP4 in the dorsal hippocampus of 5xFAD and wildtype (WT) mice, then used mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics along with label-free quantification to profile the proteome and phosphoproteome in the hippocampus. We identified patterns of protein expression and phosphorylation that are modulated in 5xFAD mice and examined the sex-specific impact of DUSP4 overexpression on the 5xFAD proteome/phosphoproteome. In 5xFAD mice, a substantial number of proteins were up- or down-regulated in both male and female mice in comparison to age and sex-matched WT mice, many of which are involved in AD-related biological processes, such as the activated immune response or suppression of synaptic activities. Upon DUSP4 overexpression, significantly regulated proteins were found in pathways that were suppressed, such as the immune response, in male 5xFAD mice. In contrast, such a shift was absent in female mice. For the phosphoproteome, we detected an array of phosphorylation sites that are regulated in 5xFAD compared to WT, and are modulated by DUSP4 overexpression in each sex. Interestingly, the changes in 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation occurred in opposite directions. Strikingly, both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation changes were found for the most part in neurons, and play key roles in neuronal processes and synaptic function. Site-centric pathway analysis revealed that both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation sites were enriched for a number of kinase sets in female, but only a limited number of sets of kinases in male mice. Taken together, our results suggest that male and female 5xFAD mice respond to DUSP4 overexpression via shared and sex-specific molecular mechanisms, which might underly similar reductions in amyloid pathology in both sexes, while learning deficits were reduced in only females with DUSP4 overexpression. Finally, we validated our findings with the sex-specific AD-associated proteomes in human cohorts and further developed DUSP4-centric proteomic network models and signaling maps for each sex.",

In this study, we explore the link between GD and risk of clinical AD. Cox and Fine-Grey models were applied to a retrospective propensity-score-matched cohort of 15,505 individuals with GD drawn from a nationally representative 5% sample of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries age 65 + over the 1991-2017 period. Results showed that the presence of GD was associated with a higher risk of AD (Hazard Ratio [HR]:1.15; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]:1.07-1.23).

The known disease-associated Annexin A11 (ANXA11) mutations result in ANXA11 aggregation, alterations in lysosomal-RNA granule co-trafficking, and TDP-43 mis-localization and present as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia. We identified a novel VUS in ANXA11 (P93S) in a kindred with corticobasal syndrome and unique radiographic features that segregated with disease. We then queried neurodegenerative disorder clinic databases to identify the phenotypic spread of ANXA11 mutations. Multi-modal computational analysis of this variant was performed and the effect of this VUS on ANXA11 function and TDP-43 biology was characterized in iPSC-derived neurons. Single-cell sequencing and proteomic analysis of iPSC-derived neurons and microglia were used to determine the multiomic signature of this VUS. Mutations in ANXA11 were found in association with clinically diagnosed corticobasal syndrome, thereby establishing corticobasal syndrome as part of ANXA11 clinical spectrum. In iPSC-derived neurons expressing mutant ANXA11, we found decreased colocalization of lysosomes and decreased neuritic RNA as well as decreased nuclear TDP-43 and increased formation of cryptic exons compared to controls. Multiomic assessment of the P93S variant in iPSC-derived neurons and microglia indicates that the pathogenic omic signature in neurons is modest compared to microglia. Additionally, omic studies reveal that immune dysregulation and interferon signaling pathways in microglia are central to disease. Collectively, these findings identify a new pathogenic variant in ANXA11, expand the range of clinical syndromes caused by ANXA11 mutations, and implicate both neuronal and microglia dysfunction in ANXA11 pathophysiology. This work illustrates the potential for iPSC-derived cellular models to revolutionize the variant annotation process and provides a generalizable approach to determining causality of novel variants across genes.",

The 3D-QSAR model screened the active compounds B25, B29, B35, B40, B45, B46, B48, B61, and B66 by the field points and activity atlas model from the prepared library. At the molecular level, docking was performed on active compounds for leading hit compounds such as B25 and B35 that displayed a high MolDock score, efficacy, and compatibility with drug delivery against the antioxidant activity. Optimization of the structure and chemical reactivity parameter of the hit compound was calculated by DFT. Moreover, ADMET prediction was evaluated to check the bioavailability and toxicity of the hit compound. Hesperidin (B25) is found to be a hit compound after the whole study and can be synthesized for potent drug discovery in the future.",

        "AbstractText": "The high prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and dementia is a growing concern for healthcare systems and patients. The primary objective of our study was to assess the association of depression and heart disease on the risk of dementias like Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia in patients. This retrospective study used electronic health records data that was provided by the HealthVerity\u2122 Marketplace. The characteristics of the patient population were recorded and the risk of dementia was examined using adjusted logistic regression models. The analysis included 49,735 participants and revealed that patients who have heart disease or depression had a higher risk of dementia. Patients who had both heart disease and depression were over three times more likely to have dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and over five times more likely to have vascular dementia compared to patients who only have a diagnosis of heart disease. Depression was associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of dementia. Participants with a diagnosis of most types of heart disease as well as depression had increased risk for developing dementia. This study revealed that patients with both heart disease and depression had increased odds of having dementia as well as vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. These findings may serve to support policies and healthcare decision-making to increase preventive measures for dementia and Alzheimer's disease among patients with both depression and heart disease.

CI in dementia and Alzheimer's disease is associated with neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigated a potential role of neuroinflammation in ADT-related CI. Patients with prostate cancer on ADT for \u22653\u2009months were categorized as having ADT-emergent CI or normal cognition (NC) based on self-report at interview. Neuroinflammation was evaluated using positron emission tomography (PET) with the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [11C]-PBR28. [11C]-PBR28 uptake in various brain regions was quantified as standardized uptake value (SUVR, normalized to cerebellum) and related to blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) choice-reaction time task (CRT) activation maps. Eleven patients underwent PET: four with reported CI (rCI), six with reported NC (rNC), and one status unrecorded. PET did not reveal any between-group differences in SUVR regionally or globally. There was no difference between groups on brain activation to the CRT. Regardless of the reported cognitive status, there was strong correlation between PET-TSPO signal and CRT activation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial cortex. We found no difference in neuroinflammation measured by PET-TSPO between patients with rCI and rNC. However, we speculate that the strong correlation between TSPO uptake and BOLD-fMRI activation in brain regions involved in memory and known to have high androgen-receptor expression mediating plasticity (hippocampus and amygdala) might reflect inflammatory effects of ADT with compensatory upregulated/increased synaptic functions. Further studies of this imaging readout are warranted to investigate ADT-related CI.",

This methodological commentary will correlate recent studies demonstrating the ability of sound waves to carry mass, how the EPIC technique spinal procedure uses a sound wave impulse to create measurable changes in spinal alignment, and the clinical safety and efficacy of this approach. The EPIC technique is a direct genealogical descendant of the technique originally developed by the founding family of chiropractic. With sound wave therapies currently being used to break up kidney stones, called lithotripsy, in physical therapy for the treatment of soft tissue injuries, in the treatment of prostate cancer, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, it is possible that the use of sound wave therapies may enter into the realm of altering joint biomechanics. Through a neurovascular examination, the EPIC technique spinal procedure can ascertain the presence of craniocervical subluxation, followed by acquiring multi-dimensional radiographic images for structural analysis. Currently using digital radiographic analysis, the EPIC technique acquires an epigenetic profile of structural asymmetries as well as a multi-directional biomechanical malposition profile of the spine, combining both profiles to ascertain the exact degrees for realignment. EPIC clinics have successfully utilized EPIC on over 20,000 cases. Comparison of pre-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra around the Z-axis measured on digital radiographs, and post-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra measured on digital radiographs immediately following the procedure, demonstrated an average 52% reduction in lateral biomechanical displacement around the Z-axis in a select group of over 2,000 cases.

Consistent with this, disease states such as Alzheimer's disease and insulin-resistant diabetes, that impair cognitive metabolism, impair cognition with this being shown again most prominently for hippocampally mediated processes. In addition to glucose supplied from the blood, brain oxidative metabolism can use local glycogen stores (within astrocytes) as a fuel source via conversion to lactate; both lactate and glycogen have been shown to be important contributors to regulation of cognitive metabolism. Insulin has been shown to be a key regulator of hippocampal cognitive and metabolic processes; in the periphery, insulin facilitates glycogen synthesis and storage, but the impact on brain glycogen is unclear. Furthermore, the impact of diet-induced diabetes on hippocampal glycogen levels and/or metabolism is unknown. Here, we show that in rats with high-fat diet-induced diabetes, hippocampal glycogen is reduced and is less responsive to acute intrahippocampal administration of insulin, which significantly reduces glycogen in the hippocampi of control animals: Our data suggest that impaired fuel availability from glycogen may be a contributing factor to the cognitive impairment seen in disease states that include central insulin resistance.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. Current cellular models for AD often require several months to exhibit phenotypic features due to the lack of an aging environment in vitro. Lamin A is a key component of the nuclear lamina. Progerin, a truncated protein resulting from specific lamin A mutations, causes Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a disease that prematurely ages individuals. Studies have reported that lamin A expression is induced in the brains of AD patients, and overlapping cellular phenotypes have been observed between HGPS and AD cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of exogenous progerin expression on neural progenitor cells carrying familial AD mutations (FAD). Within three to four weeks of differentiation, these cells exhibited robust AD phenotypes, including increased tau phosphorylation, amyloid plaque accumulation, and an elevated A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 ratio. Additionally, progerin expression significantly increased AD cellular phenotypes such as cell death and cell cycle re-entry. Our results suggest that progerin expression could be used to create an accelerated model for AD development and drug screening.",

        "AbstractText": "Accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) aggregates in synapses may contribute to the profound synaptic loss characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The origin of synaptic A\u03b2 aggregates remains elusive, but loss of endosomal proteostasis may trigger their formation.In this study we identified the synaptic compartments where A\u03b2 accumulates and performed a longitudinal analysis of synaptosomes isolated from brains of TgCRND8 APP transgenic mice of either sex. To evaluate the specific contribution of A\u03b2-degrading protease endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1) to synaptic/endosomal A\u03b2 homeostasis, we analyzed the effect of partial Ece1 knockout in brain and complete ECE1 knockout in SH-SY5Y cells. Global inhibition of ECE family members was used to further assess their role in preventing synaptic A\u03b2 accumulation.Results showed that, before extracellular amyloid deposition, synapses were burdened with detergent-soluble A\u03b2 monomers, oligomers, and fibrils. Levels of all soluble A\u03b2 species declined thereafter, as A\u03b242 turned progressively insoluble and accumulated in A\u03b2-producing synaptic endosomal vesicles with characteristics of multivesicular bodies. Accordingly, fibrillar A\u03b2 was detected in brain exosomes. ECE-1 deficient mice had significantly increased endogenous synaptosomal A\u03b242 levels and protease inhibitor experiments showed that in TgCRND8 mice, synaptic A\u03b242 became nearly resistant to degradation by ECE-related proteases.Our study supports that A\u03b2 accumulating in synapses is produced locally, within endosomes, and does not require the presence of amyloid plaques. ECE-1 is a determinant factor controlling the accumulation and fibrillization of nascent A\u03b2 in endosomes and, in TgCRND8 mice, A\u03b2 overproduction causes rapid loss of A\u03b242 solubility that curtails ECE-mediated degradation.Significance StatementDeposition of aggregated A\u03b2 in extracellular plaques is a defining feature of AD. A\u03b2 aggregates also accumulate in synapses and may contribute to the profound synaptic loss and cognitive dysfunction typical of the disease. However, it is not clear whether synaptotoxic A\u03b2 is mainly derived from plaques or if it is produced and aggregated locally, within affected synaptic compartments. Filling this knowledge gap is important for the development of an effective treatment for AD, as extracellular and intrasynaptic pools of A\u03b2 may not be equally modulated by immunotherapies or other therapeutic approaches. In this manuscript we provide evidence that A\u03b2 aggregates building up in synapses are formed locally, within synaptic endosomes, due to disruptions in nascent A\u03b2 proteostasis.",

Furthermore, zebrafish exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of Cr (EC group: 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L) for an extended period of 9\u00a0weeks exhibited behaviors comparable to those observed in the HC group. Moreover, the study investigated the neuroprotective effects of donepezil (Don), galantamine (Gal) and resveratrol (Res) drugs in response to neurobehavioral impairments induced by Cr (VI) exposure in zebrafish. Don and Res effectively protect the zebrafish from Cr (VI)-induced anxiety, and memory impairment. Furthermore, Cr (VI) exposure induced heightened oxidative stress while simultaneously diminishing antioxidant enzyme levels. Remarkably, these effects were counteracted in the drug-treated groups. Likewise, exposure to Cr (VI) led to an increase in the expression of genes linked to AD and neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, drug treatment reversed this effect in Cr (VI)-exposed fish. The results of our study highlight the potentials of zebrafish model in demonstrating neurobehavioral impairments induced by Cr (VI), thereby paving the way for its utilization in vivo neurobehaviors investigations and pharmaceutical screening.",

Here we report the development of a membrane-permeable peptide that inhibits MARK4 activity in an allosteric manner. The SARS-CoV-2-derived protein Orf9b inhibited MARK4-mediated tau phosphorylation in primary neurons and Drosophila. Orf9b inhibited MARK4 activity in an allosteric manner and did not inhibit the activity of MARK2, which is another MARK family member and is closely related to MARK4. Co-expression of Orf9b in the fly retina expressing human tau and MARK4 suppressed phosphorylation of tau at the microtubule-binding repeats and tau-induced neurodegeneration. We identified the minimal sequence of Orf9b required to suppress MARK4 activity and fused it to a cell-permeable sequence (TAT-Orf9b10-18_78-95). Extracellular supplementation of TAT-Orf9b10-18_78-95 inhibited MARK4 activity in primary neurons, and feeding TAT-Orf9b10-18_78-95 to a fly model of tauopathy lowered phospho-tau levels and suppressed neurodegeneration.

The resultant variant with a 69 amino acid signal peptide, designated N-BChE, could play a role in AD development. Here, we report that the signal sequence of the BChE, if produced in an extended 69 aa version, can self-aggregate and could form seeds that enhance amyloid fibril formation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and create larger co-aggregates.

        "AbstractText": "Accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from the brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a crucial task in the neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus structures is challenging due to the small volume, complex shape, low contrast and discontinuous boundaries of hippocampus. Although some methods have been developed for the hippocampus segmentation, most of them paid too much attention to the hippocampus shape and volume instead of considering the spatial information. Additionally, the extracted features are independent of each other, ignoring the correlation between the global and local information. In view of this, here we proposed a novel cross-layer dual Encoding-Shared Decoding network framework with Spatial self-Attention mechanism (called ESDSA) for hippocampus segmentation in human brains. Considering that the hippocampus is a relatively small part in MRI, we introduced the spatial self-attention mechanism in ESDSA to capture the spatial information of hippocampus for improving the segmentation accuracy. We also designed a cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network to effectively extract the global information of MRIs and the spatial information of hippocampus. The spatial features of hippocampus and the features extracted from the MRIs were combined to realize the hippocampus segmentation. Results on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data show that the performance of our ESDSA is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, and the dice similarity coefficient of ESDSA achieves 89.37%. In addition, the dice similarity coefficient of the Spatial Self-Attention mechanism (SSA) strategy and the dual Encoding-Shared Decoding (ESD) strategy is 9.47%, 5.35% higher than that of the baseline U-net, respectively, indicating that the strategies of SSA and ESD can effectively enhance the segmentation accuracy of human brain hippocampus.",

However, access for this population to professional service providers is limited. Therefore, there is an increasing need for access to mental health services and new mental health care resources tailored to adolescents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functionality and effectiveness of a school digital mental health clinic (DMHC) created by a Chinese psychiatric hospital and provided to secondary school students for a trial. The trial period of the DMHC was from January to July 2021 at three secondary schools in Taizhou City, China. Under a collaborative agreement between the local educational bureau and provider, use of the DMHC was free to all students, teachers, and staff of the schools. The functionality of the DMHC was compared with existing digital health interventions introduced in the literature and its effectiveness was quantitatively analyzed in terms of the volume of received counseling calls, number of calls per 100 students, length and time of calls, and reasons for the calls. The mini course video views were analyzed by topics and viewing time. The design functions of the DMHC are well aligned with required factors defined in the literature. The first advantage of this DMHC is its high accessibility to students in the three schools. All functions of the DMHC are free to use by students, thereby eliminating the economic barriers to seeking and receiving care. Students can receive virtual counseling during or after regular working hours. Acceptability of the DHMC was further ensured by the full support from a national top-tier mental health facility. Any audio or video call from a student user would connect them to a live, qualified professional (ie, a psychiatrist or psychologist). Options are provided to view and listen to resources for stress relief or tips to help address mental health needs. The major reasons for the counseling calls included difficulties in learning, interpersonal relationships, and emotional distress. The three topics with the highest level of interest for the mini course videos were emotional assistance, personal growth, and family member relationships. The DMHC served as an effective tool for crisis prevention and intervention during nonworking hours as most of the live calls and mini video viewing occurred after school or over the weekend. Furthermore, the DMHC helped three students at high risk for suicide and self-injury through live-call intervention. The DMHC is an effective complementary solution to improve access to professional mental health care facilities, especially during nonworking hours, thereby helping adolescents meet their mental health needs. Extension of the DMHC into more schools and other settings is recommended.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalently neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal damage which is associated with amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation. Hederagenin is a triterpenoid saponin, exerting anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoral, and neuroprotective activities. However, its role in AD progression is still obscure. The aim of this study was to explore the influences of hederagenin on A\u03b2-caused neuronal injury in vitro. Neuronal cells were treated with A\u03b225-35 (A\u03b2) to establish a cellular model of AD. Cell viability was assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Oxidative stress was evaluated by detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Apoptosis was investigated using TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity assays. Protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 1 (PTPN1) was screened by bioinformatics analysis. Protein levels of PTPN1 and protein kinase B (Akt) were measured by western blotting. Hederagenin (2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM) alone did not affect viability of neuronal cells, but relieved A\u03b2-induced viability reduction. Hederagenin mitigated A\u03b2-induced increase in ROS accumulation and decrease in SOD activity. Hederagenin attenuated A\u03b2-induced increase in apoptotic rate and caspase-3 activity. PTPN1 was screened as a target of hederagenin against AD by bioinformatics analysis. Hederagenin treatment resisted A\u03b2-induced decrease in PTPN1 mRNA and protein levels in neuronal cells. PTPN1 silencing attenuated the suppressive functions of hederagenin in A\u03b2-stimulated oxidative stress and apoptosis. Hederagenin mitigated A\u03b2-induced Akt signaling inactivation by upregulating PTPN1 expression. In conclusion, hederagenin attenuates oxidative stress and apoptosis in neuronal cells stimulated with A\u03b2 by promoting PTPN1/Akt signaling activation.",

        "AbstractText": "Accurate disease risk prediction is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional multi-omics data have provided unprecedented data resources for prediction studies, their high-dimensionality and complex inter/intra-relationships have posed significant analytical challenges. We proposed a two-step Bayesian linear mixed model framework (TBLMM) for risk prediction analysis on multi-omics data. TBLMM models the predictive effects from multi-omics data using a hybrid of the sparsity regression and linear mixed model with multiple random effects. It can resemble the shape of the true effect size distributions and accounts for non-linear, including interaction effects, among multi-omics data via kernel fusion. It infers its parameters via a computationally efficient variational Bayes algorithm. Through extensive simulation studies and the prediction analyses on the positron emission tomography imaging outcomes using data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we have demonstrated that TBLMM can consistently outperform the existing method in predicting the risk of complex traits. The corresponding R package is available on GitHub (https://github.com/YaluWen/TBLMM).",

Untreated RBD carries risks for physical injury from falls or other traumatic events during dream enactment as well as risk of injury to the bed partner. Currently, melatonin and clonazepam are the mainstay pharmacological therapies for RBD. However, therapeutic response to these medications is variable. While older adults are most vulnerable to RBD, they are also particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, including increased risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Prazosin is a centrally active alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist often prescribed for trauma nightmares characterized by REM sleep without atonia in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. We report a case of successful RBD management with prazosin in a patient in whom high dose melatonin was ineffective. Although there was no observable reduction of dream-enactment behaviors with high dose melatonin, the possibility of a synergistic effect of prazosin combined with melatonin cannot be ruled out. This case report supports further evaluation of prazosin as a potential therapeutic for RBD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder with variability in pathology and clinical progression. AD patients may differ in individual-level benefit from amyloid beta removal therapy. Random forest models were applied to the EMERGE trial to create an individual-level treatment response (ITR) score which represents individual-level benefit of high-dose aducanumab relative to the placebo. This ITR score was used to test the existence of heterogeneity in treatment effect (HTE). We found statistical evidence of HTE in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB;P\u00a0=\u00a0 0.034). The observed CDR-SB benefit was 0.79 points greater in the group with the top 25% of ITR score compared to the remaining 75% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.020). Of note, the highest treatment responders had lower hippocampal volume, higher plasma phosphorylated tau 181 and a shorter duration of clinical AD at baseline. This ITR analysis provides a proof of concept for precision medicine in future AD research and drug development. Emerging trials have shown a population-level benefit from amyloid beta (A\u03b2) removal in slowing cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work demonstrates significant heterogeneity of individual-level treatment effect of aducanumab in early AD. The greatest clinical responders to A\u03b2 removal therapy have a pattern of more severe neurodegenerative process.",

Here, the authors\u00a0describe an integrated serial sectioning polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PSOCT) and two photon microscopy (2PM) system to provide label-free multi-contrast imaging of intact brain structures, including scattering, birefringence, and autofluorescence of human brain tissue.

Here, we studied the propitious role of E3 ubiquitin ligase Pirh2 in A\u03b2 protein aggregation in view of its regulatory ligase activity in the ubiquitin-proteasome system\u00a0employing both cellular and sporadic rodent models of AD. Pirh2 protein abundance was significantly increased during Streptozotocin (STZ) induced AD conditions, and transient silencing of Pirh2 significantly inhibited the A\u03b2 aggregation and modified the dendrite morphology along with the substantial decrease in choline level in the differentiated neurons. MALDI-TOF/TOF, coimmunoprecipitation, and UbcH7-linked in vitro ubiquitylation analysis confirmed the high interaction of Pirh2 with chaperone GRP78. Furthermore, Pirh2 silencing inhibits the STZ induced altered level of endoplasmic reticulum stress and intracellular Ca2+ levels in neuronal N2a cells. Pirh2 silencing also inhibited the AD conditions related to the altered protein abundance of HSP90 and its co-chaperones which may collectively involve in the reduced burden of amyloid aggregates in neuronal cells. Pirh2 silencing further stabilized the nuclear translocation of phospho-Nrf2 and inhibited the altered level of autophagy factors. Taken together, our data indicated that Pirh2 is critically involved in STZ induced AD pathogenesis through its interaction with ER-chaperone GRP78, improves the neuronal connectivity, affects the altered level of chaperones, co-chaperones, & autophagic markers, and collectively inhibits the A\u03b2 aggregation.",

This review aims to delineate the predominant NPS, compile a comprehensive list of the most commonly employed NPS assessment tools, and corroborate the principal findings regarding the link between NPS and neuropsychological assessment and neurobiological substrates. Methods: To conduct this scoping review, we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We searched for relevant articles published between 2017 and 2023 in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Results: Of the 61 eligible articles, depression, anxiety, and apathy were the main NPSs. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and Neuropsychiatric Inventory were the primary assessment tools used to evaluate NPS. Correlations between NPS severity and neurobiological markers were considered clinically significant. Furthermore, clinical procedures prioritized the use of global cognitive screening tools, assessments of executive functions, and functionality evaluations. Conclusion: Standardization of procedures is necessary because of the diversity of methods. The data show that NPS can predict the etiology, severity, form, and type of disease progression, serving as a precursor sign of AD. The results of the most common cognitive screening tools and NPS instruments provided an interesting overview of future clinical approaches.",

        "AbstractText": "In addition to memory deficits, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience neuropsychiatric disturbances. Recent studies have suggested the association of obsessive-compulsive disorder with the early stages of AD. However, there is a lack of understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of compulsive-like behaviors at the neuronal circuit level and their relationship with AD. We have addressed this issue in an amyloid-\u03b2 1-42-induced mouse model of AD by studying compulsive-like behaviors. Next, we compared the hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) local field potential pattern and coherence between these regions of control and AD mice. We also assessed the expression pattern of acetylcholine and glutamatergic signaling in these regions, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Our findings show that AD mice exhibit compulsive-like behaviors, as evidenced by enhanced marble burying, nest building, and burrowing. Furthermore, AD mice exhibited hippocampo-cortical circuit dysfunction demonstrated by decreased power of rhythmic oscillations at the theta (4-12 Hz) and gamma (25-50 Hz) frequencies in the hippocampus and mPFC, two functionally interconnected brain regions involved both in AD and compulsive behaviors. Importantly, coherence between the hippocampus and mPFC in the theta band of AD animals was significantly reduced. Furthermore, we found reduced cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and mPFC of AD mice. We conclude that the hippocampo-cortical functional alterations may play a significant role in mediating the compulsive-like behaviors observed in AD mice. These findings may help in understanding the underlying circuit mechanisms of obsessive-compulsive disorder-like phenotypes associated with AD.",

The aim of this qualitative literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO with keywords related to online, support group, caregiver, and dementia was to collect the reported experiences by the end of 2022. Peer reviewed journal papers were included when published and written in English. After the joint decision of two reviewers, it was decided to only include studies that were published in Medline. The results of the literature search are compared with experiences of the participants in a presentation group that was transformed into an online group at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic via Zoom. In search yielded a total of 129 articles. 113 articles described different types of interventions, 30 of which had a randomized design. The qualitative literature search showed on the one hand a high interest in online support groups but on the other hand that the effectiveness and efficacy in randomized trials is much less clear. In addition, we investigated the assessments and experiences of the participants in a presentation group that was transformed into an online group at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic via Zoom. This study demonstrates that PLWD and carers on virtual group meetings can express significant emotive capacity and enhanced connectivity with one another despite a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia. Further research on entry criteria, concerns about online support services in general and necessary support for use is essential to develop the time- and location-independent possibility of video-based online self-help into an important form of support for both PLWD and their caregivers as an additional support option independent of exceptional pandemic situations.",

Development of AD treatment has primarily centered on developing pharmaceuticals that target amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques in the brain, a hallmark pathological biomarker that precedes symptomatic AD. Though recent clinical trials of novel drugs that target A\u03b2 have demonstrated promising preliminary data, these pharmaceuticals have a poor history of developing into AD treatments, leading to hypotheses that other therapeutic targets may be more suitable for AD prevention and treatment. Impaired brain energy metabolism is another pathological hallmark that precedes the onset of AD that may provide a target for intervention. The brain creatine (Cr) system plays a crucial role in maintaining bioenergetic flux and is disrupted in AD. Recent studies using AD mouse models have shown that supplementing with Cr improves brain bioenergetics, as well as AD biomarkers and cognition. Despite these promising findings, no human trials have investigated the potential benefits of Cr supplementation in AD.

This study aimed to examine the association of triglycerides with dementia and cognition change in community-dwelling older adults. This prospective longitudinal study used data from the ASPREE randomized trial of adults aged \u226565 years without dementia or previous cardiovascular events at enrolment. The main outcome was incident dementia. Other outcomes included changes in composite cognition and domain-specific cognition (global cognition, memory, language and executive function, and psychomotor speed). The association between baseline triglycerides and dementia risk was estimated using Cox proportional-hazard models adjusting for relevant risk factors. Linear mixed models were used to investigate cognitive change. The analysis was repeated in a sub-cohort of participants with available APOE-\u03b54 genetic data with additional adjustment for APOE-\u03b54 carrier status, and an external cohort (UK Biobank) with similar selection criteria applied. The study included 18,294 ASPREE participants and 68,200 UK Biobank participants (mean age: 75.1 & 66.9 years; female: 56.3% & 52.7%; median [IQR] triglyceride:106 [80-142]mg/dl & 139 [101-193]mg/dl), with dementia recorded in 823 and 2,778 individuals over a median follow-up of 6.4 and 12.5 years, respectively. Higher triglyceride levels were associated with lower dementia risk in the entire ASPREE cohort (HR with doubling of TG: 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.94). Findings were similar in the sub-cohort of participants with APOE-\u03b54 genetic data (n=13,976), and in the UK Biobank cohort (HR was 0.82 and 0.83, respectively, all p\u22640.01).

Older adults with higher triglyceride levels within the normal to high-normal range had a lower dementia risk and slower cognitive decline over time compared to individuals with lower triglyceride levels. Higher triglyceride levels may be reflective of better overall health and/or lifestyle behaviors that would protect against dementia development.

Therefore, the diagnosis of AD holds significant importance. The interactions between regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain often involve multiple areas collaborating in a nonlinear manner. Leveraging these nonlinear higher-order interaction features to their fullest potential contributes to enhancing the accuracy of AD diagnosis. To address this, a framework combining nonlinear higher-order feature extraction and three-dimensional (3D) hypergraph neural networks is proposed for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD. First, a support vector machine regression model based on the radial basis function kernel was trained on ROI data to obtain a base estimator. Then, a recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the base estimator was applied to extract nonlinear higher-order features from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These features were subsequently constructed into a hypergraph, leveraging the complex interactions captured in the data. Finally, a four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal hypergraph convolutional neural network model was constructed based on the fMRI data for classification. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the Hyper Graph Convolutional Network (HyperGCN) framework by 8% and traditional two-dimensional (2D) linear feature extraction methods by 12% in the AD/normal control (NC) classification task. In conclusion, this framework demonstrates an improvement in AD classification compared to mainstream deep learning methods, providing valuable evidence for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD. \u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\uff08AD\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8f6c\u7684\u5927\u8111\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u5316\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u60a3\u8005\u8bb0\u5fc6\u529b\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0cAD\u8bca\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5927\u8111\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff08ROI\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u591a\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u534f\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u7c7b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8AD\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u8d85\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684AD\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9996\u5148\u9488\u5bf9ROI\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u6838\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u57fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\uff08fMRI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u9636\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u9020\u6210\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u57fa\u4e8efMRI\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u6027\u642d\u5efa\u8d85\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5021\u8bae\uff08ADNI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728AD/\u6b63\u5e38\u5bf9\u7167\uff08NC\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eHyper Graph Convolutional Network\uff08HyperGCN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868%\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612%\u3002\u7efc\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6846\u67b6\u5728AD\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u8f83\u4e3b\u6d41\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3aAD\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u4f9d\u636e\u3002.",

Using a proximity extension assay, we aimed to identify candidate serum protein biomarkers for disease activity in CIDP. We collected clinical data and serum of 106 patients with CIDP. Patients starting induction treatment (n=53) and patients on maintenance treatment starting treatment withdrawal (n=40) were assessed at baseline and at 6\u2009months (or at relapse). Patients in remission (n=13) were assessed once. Clinical disease activity was defined based on improvement or deterioration by the minimal clinically important difference on the inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale in combination with either grip strength or the Medical Research Council sum score. Using a proximity extension assay (Olink Explore platform), 1472 protein levels were analysed in serum. Candidate proteins were selected based on fold change>0.5\u2009or <-0.5\u2009and p<0.05 between clinically active and inactive disease. Longitudinal changes of candidate proteins between baseline and follow-up were analysed. We identified 48 candidate proteins that differed between clinically active and inactive disease on cross-sectional comparison. Five of these proteins (SUGT1, IRAK4, DCTN1, 5'-nucleotidase cytosolic IIIA (NT5C3A), glutaredoxin (GLRX)) also showed longitudinal changes consistent with disease activity changes. IRAK4 was also identified in a sensitivity analysis, using another definition for disease activity. Our results indicate that IRAK4 and possibly SUGT1, DCTN1, NT5C3A and GLRX are candidate biomarkers for monitoring clinical disease activity in CIDP.",

Cross-sectional. Primary care electronic health record data, the Clinical Practice Research database linked with secondary care data, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and patient-level deprivation data, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). The prevalence per 100\u2009000 of the population and corresponding 95% CIs for both diagnosed AD and eAD overall and stratified by covariates. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the sensitivity of the population definition and look-back period. There were 448\u2009797 patients identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink that satisfied the study inclusion criteria and were eligible for HES and IMD linkage. For the main analysis of AD and eAD, 379\u2009763 patients are eligible for inclusion in the denominator. This resulted in an estimated prevalence of diagnosed AD of 378.39 (95% CI, 359.36 to 398.44) per 100\u2009000 and eAD of 292.81 (95% CI, 276.12 to 310.52) per 100\u2009000. Prevalence estimates across main and sensitivity analyses for the entire AD study population were found to vary widely with estimates ranging from 137.48 (95% CI, 127.05 to 148.76) to 796.55 (95% CI, 768.77 to 825.33). There was significant variation in prevalence of diagnosed eAD when assessing the sensitivity with the look-back periods, as low as 120.54 (95% CI, 110.80 to 131.14) per 100 000, and as high as 519.01 (95% CI, 496.64 to 542.37) per 100\u2009000. The study found relatively consistent patterns of prevalence across both AD and eAD populations. Generally, the prevalence of diagnosed AD increased with age and increased with deprivation for each age category. Women had a higher prevalence than men. More granular levels of stratification reduced patient numbers and increased the uncertainty of point prevalence estimates. Despite this, the study found a relationship between deprivation and prevalence of AD.",

We investigated the associations between fatty acids, vitamins D, B6, B12, folate, and homocysteine and the cerebral load of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2). This cross-sectional study included 177 older adults (70 to 96 years, 65% female) with objective cognitive impairment, pre-frail, or frail. Cerebral A\u03b2 load was determined using PET Standardized Uptake Value ratios (SUVr). Fatty acids were assessed in erythrocytes, vitamins D and homocysteine in serum, and the other vitamins in plasma. Linear regression models corrected for multiple comparisons evaluated the associations between each nutrient and A\u03b2. The principal component factor followed by linear regression grouped the fatty acids strongly correlated (factor) and associated with A\u03b2. Higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) clupanodonic acid (22:5n-3) (\u03b2: -0.13; p= 0.001), mead acid (20:3n-9) (\u03b2: -0.07; p= 0.036), and adrenic acid (22:4n-6) (\u03b2: -0.05; p=0.031) were associated with lower global A\u03b2 load, while linoleic acid (18:2n-6) was associated with higher global A\u03b2 load (\u03b2: 0.18; p= 0.042). Clupanodonic acid was inversely associated with A\u03b2 in all cerebral regions except the thalamus. The factor composed of mead, clupanodonic, and arachidonic (20:4n-6) acids was associated with a lower global A\u03b2 load (\u03b2: -0.02; p=0.002). Some erythrocyte PUFAs were inversely associated with A\u03b2 load in the brain, and most of them were metabolites of the essential fatty acids linoleic and \u03b1-linolenic.

        "AbstractText": "This study evaluated the prevalence and patterns of behavioral symptoms, including agitation/aggression (AA), psychotic symptoms (PS), anxiety/mood disorders (MD), and delirium among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their association with diagnosed insomnia. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using the MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database 2016-2020. Patients aged \u226550 with newly diagnosed AD (N\u00a0= 56,904) were identified during 2017-2019 and categorized into insomnia and non-insomnia groups based on billing codes recorded in medical and pharmacy claims. The index date was defined as the earliest date of diagnosis/medication of insomnia. The new diagnosis of AD had to be established within 12\u00a0months before (baseline) or 3\u00a0months after the index date. Point prevalence of behavioral symptoms was estimated during baseline and the 12-month follow-up period. Propensity score matching was performed to match patients with and without insomnia. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to assess the risk of diagnosis of behavioral symptoms among insomnia and non-insomnia groups. The study cohort included 7808 patients with newly diagnosed AD (mean age\u00a0= 79.4, SD\u00a0= 9.6\u00a0years). The point prevalence of behavioral symptoms was as follows: among those with insomnia (n\u00a0= 3904), in the baseline, AA\u00a0= 9.0%, PS\u00a0= 12.5%, and MD\u00a0= 57.8%, and during the follow-up, AA\u00a0= 13.9%, PS\u00a0= 16.3%, and MD\u00a0= 72.1%; among those without insomnia (n\u00a0= 3904), in the baseline, AA\u00a0= 6.2%, PS\u00a0= 9.2%, and MD\u00a0= 41.4%; and during the follow-up, AA\u00a0= 7.4%, PS\u00a0= 10.4%, and MD\u00a0= 49.2%. The likelihood of being diagnosed with any behavioral symptoms in the follow-up period was significantly higher among patients with insomnia than those without (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-3.1).

The present study aimed at investigating differences in the recall of short narratives between participants with mild AD (AD) and a control group of typical older adults (CG) with the use of automatic assessment. 17 older adults diagnosed with AD (mean age 76.41, mean education 5,82) and 34 typical older adults (mean age 74.26, mean education 7.09) were asked to listen to and then retell a short story. Syntactic, lexical, and semantic features were assessed via the NILC-Metrix software, and the features were correlated with episodic, working, and semantic memory assessment. Differences were found in 7 of the 34 features assessed. Syntactically, the group diagnosed with AD produced narratives with fewer sentences, fewer words per sentence, and lower Yngve depth scores. Lexically, the AD group produced narratives with fewer words and prepositions per sentence. Semantically, the narratives produced by the AD group featured words with a lower mean age of acquisition, and lower Brun\u00e9t's index scores. For the CG group, episodic memory performance correlated with the ratio of conjunctions. No other significant correlation was found for semantic and working memory in the CG. No correlation was found between memory performance and linguistic features for the AD group. The automatic assessment of linguistic features showed impaired narrative recall in participants diagnosed with AD relative to healthy controls at the syntactic, lexical, and semantic levels of discourse. These findings corroborate previous literature showing a decline in discourse production performance resulting from cognitive impairment in AD. The assessment of linguistic performance through a narrative recall task provides valuable insights into cognitive decline related to Alzheimer's disease.",

Yet, they are less likely to benefit from evidence-based interventions given their continued underrepresentation in ADRD-related research. Community advisory boards (CABs) have the potential to address barriers to research for underrepresented communities; however, there are complexities to establishing and sustaining CABs. This article describes how our work addressed challenges in CABs related to unbalanced power relations, language barriers, the value of time, and low research knowledge and health literacy. Nine Latino CAB members, including older Latino caregivers, were trained in a comprehensive program designed to increase knowledge about health research methods and ethics, cognitive health, and cultural adaptation methods. Members completed pre- and post-training measures of Alzheimer's disease knowledge, attitudes and beliefs toward research, and a satisfaction survey. Results from the satisfaction questionnaire indicated that the program was well received. CAB members increased their knowledge regarding management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and dementia-associated risk factors and treatment. Positive changes in members' attitudes toward research included increased willingness to participate in trials and subject protection measures. Formalized training in research conduct and ethics and health literacy is a promising strategy to reduce challenges in establishing and maintaining CABs and can also optimize CAB impact to address gaps in older Latino ADRD caregiving research.",

        "AbstractText": "Growing epidemiological evidence suggests an adverse relationship between exposure to air pollutants and cognitive health, and this could be related to the effect of air pollution on vascular health. We aim to evaluate the association between air pollution exposure and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker of cerebral vascular burden, white matter hyperintensities (WMH). This cross-sectional analysis used data from the French Three-City Montpellier study. Randomly selected participants 65-80 years of age underwent an MRI examination to estimate their total and regional cerebral WMH volumes. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and black carbon (BC) at the participants' residential address during the 5 years before the MRI examination was estimated with land use regression models. Multinomial and binomial logistic regression assessed the associations between exposure to each of the three pollutants and categories of total and lobar WMH volumes. Participants' (n=582) median age at MRI was 70.7 years [interquartile range (IQR): 6.1], and 52% (n=300) were women. Median exposure to air pollution over the 5 years before MRI acquisition was 24.3 (IQR: 1.7) \u03bcg/m3 for PM2.5, 48.9 (14.6) \u03bcg/m3 for NO2, and 2.66 (0.60) 10-5/m for BC. We found no significant association between exposure to the three air pollutants and total WMH volume. We found that PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with higher risk of temporal lobe WMH burden [odds ratio (OR) for an IQR increase=1.82 (95% confidence interval: 1.41, 2.36) for the second volume tercile, 2.04 (1.59, 2.61) for the third volume tercile, reference: first volume tercile]. Associations for other regional WMH volumes were inconsistent. In this population-based study in older adults, PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased risk of high WMH volume in the temporal lobe, strengthening the evidence on PM2.5 adverse effect on the brain. Further studies looking at different markers of cerebrovascular damage are still needed to document the potential vascular effects of air pollution. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12231.",

Previous studies suggest diverse factors contribute to dementia-related anxiety, including emotional, social, and cognitive concerns. A mixed methods investigation was designed to explore DRA's underlying causes; we present a thematic analysis of these causes. A semi-structured qualitative interview design was used to explore participants' thoughts, feelings, and reactions about dementia. Fifty community-dwelling adults (aged 58 to 89, M = 70.80, SD = 6.02) without dementia diagnoses were interviewed, with a focus on why dementias are anxiety provoking diagnoses. We engaged in a reflexive inductive thematic approach. We identified seven themes positioned within previously established antecedents of DRA. Anticipated consequences were conveyed in statements identifying dementia as a feared diagnosis and its connection to how one would be treated if diagnosed. Low perceived control was associated with dementias' anticipated effects including the ability of dementia to undermine core aspects of one's personhood, limit independence, and increase reliance on others. Perceived risk was connected to past familial experiences with dementia and the implications of receiving different diagnoses with different trajectories and treatments. Findings offer insight into diverse factors contributing to DRA, which can be used to inform public health messaging and develop applicable and clinically relevant interventions to meet the needs of individuals experiencing DRA and their social support systems.",

The main type of aggregates, the paired helical filaments (PHF), incorporate about 20% of the full-length protein into the rigid core. Recently, cryo-electron microscopy data showed that a protease-resistant fragment of tau (residues 297-391) self-assembles in vitro in the presence of divalent cations to form twisted filaments whose molecular structure resembles that of AD PHF tau [S. L\u00f6vestam et al., Elife 11, e76494 (2022)]. To investigate whether this tau construct is uniquely predisposed to this morphology and structure, we fibrillized tau (297-391) under the reported conditions and determined its structure using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, the protein assembled predominantly into nontwisting ribbons whose rigid core spans residues 305-357. This rigid core forms a \u03b2-arch that turns at residues 322CGS324. Two protofilaments stack together via a long interface that stretches from G323 to I354. Together, these two protofilaments form a four-layered \u03b2-sheet core whose sidechains are stabilized by numerous polar and hydrophobic interactions.

Currently, the plasma based two fraction of \u03b2 amyloid peptide ratio (A\u03b242/40) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are considered as blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Recent research indicates that oxidative stress (OS) occurs prior to amyloid plaque (A\u03b2) formation and abnormal tau phosphorylation in AD. The imbalance of the master antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), and prooxidants (iron, zinc, and copper)\u2500plays a crucial role in AD neurodegeneration. We present peripheral blood-based OS related biomarkers that are mechanistically involved in the disease process and may serve as a novel screening tool for early detection of AD onset.

        "AbstractText": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects adults worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that AD may be associated with cognitive dysfunction, but the results of individual studies have been inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between AD and cognitive dysfunction in middle-aged and older adults. To find relevant research, a comprehensive search of electronic databases from the beginning to March 2023 was carried out. Data were taken from studies that were eligible, and a meta-analysis was done to determine the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We searched three databases and found a total of 15 studied arms included in 5 cohort studies with over 8.5 million participants were included in the analysis. The results showed that individuals with AD had a higher risk of developing dementia of all-cause dementia (pooled hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.10-1.23,P<0.001) and the Alzheimer type (pooled HR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63,P<0.001) but not vascular dementia (pooled HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 0.99-2.04,P<0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that the association between atopic dermatitis and all-cause dementia was significant in Europe (P = 0.004) but not in Asia (P = 0.173) and was significant in prospective cohort studies (P<0.001) but not in non-prospective cohort studies (P = 0.068). Sensitivity analysis and publication bias detection confirmed the reliability of the overall findings. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that AD was associated with increased risk of cognitive dysfunction, particularly dementia of the Alzheimer type and all-cause dementia, in middle-aged and older participants. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this association and its potential implications for clinical practice. PROSPERO, identifier (CRD42023411627).",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States, disproportionately burdens minority populations. To explore barriers to AD clinical trial participation by Asian and Native Hawaiian patients diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment. We surveyed 187 patients with a Mini-Mental State Examination score \u226514 between January 2022 and June 2022. The score cutoff for clinical trial eligibility was set by the institution. Individuals also completed a 15-question telephone survey that assessed demographics, barriers to clinical trial participation, and clinical trial improvement methods. Forty-nine patients responded, with a response rate of 26%. Asian and Native Hawaiian patients were less likely than White patients to participate in AD trials. The main barrier to participation was a lack of information about AD trials. Providing additional information regarding AD trials to patients and family members were listed as the top two reasons patients would consider participating in a clinical trial. Insufficient information about AD clinical trials is the primary barrier to participation among Asian and Native Hawaiian patients, followed by difficulty coordinating transportation and, in the case of Asians, the time required for clinical trials. Increased outreach, education, and assistance with logistics in these populations should be pursued to improve rates of participation in clinical trials.",

Here we show that the E3 ligase CHIP catalyzes the site-specific ubiquitination of Tau filaments both in vitro and in cellular models, proving that also Tau amyloid aggregates are direct substrate of PTMs. Transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry analysis on ubiquitin-modified Tau amyloids revealed that the conformation of the filaments restricts CHIP-mediated ubiquitination to specific positions of the repeat domain, while only minor alterations in the structure of the fibril core were inferred using seeding experiments in vitro and in a cell-based tauopathy model. Overexpression of CHIP significantly increased the ubiquitination of exogenous PHF, proving that the ligase can interact and modify Tau aggregates also in a complex cellular environment.",

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of individual cognitive training programs based on virtual reality (VR), a nonpharmacological intervention, on cognitive function and depression in middle-aged women at risk of cognitive impairment. It used VR technology, which has recently been recognized as a promising tool. We administered a VR-based cognitive training program for 30 minutes daily, twice a week, for 12 weeks (24 sessions). This study included middle-aged women residing in older adults' welfare facilities in G-gu, Busan, from May to August 2021. A total of 60 participants were randomly divided into the training (n=30) and control (n=30) groups. Cognitive and depressive functions were assessed using the Korean versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (K-MoCA), Digit Span Test (DST), Korean-Color Word Stroop Test (K-CWST), and Short Form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS-K) before the intervention. The training group underwent a VR-based cognitive training program, whereas the control group was educated to maintain regular daily activities. The same assessments were performed 12 weeks after treatment. A comparison of the mean scores before and after K-MoCA in the training group revealed a significant increase from 24.87 (SD 2.62) to 27.50 (SD 1.70; P<.01), indicating substantial cognitive improvement. Similarly, the mean DST forward scores increased significantly from 6.97 (SD 1.10) to 7.90 (SD 1.18; P<.01), suggesting enhanced short-term auditory memory and attention. The mean DST backward scores also showed a significant improvement from 4.10 (SD 0.71) to 4.77 (SD 1.2; P=.01). Notably, the mean SGDS-K scores decreased significantly from 3.97 (SD 2.51) to 2.13 (SD 1.87; P<.01), indicating a reduction in depression within the training group. The VR-based cognitive training programs significantly enhanced cognitive function and reduced depression in middle-aged women. Consequently, these programs are considered beneficial nonpharmacological cognitive training interventions for middle-aged women at high risk of cognitive impairment.

        "AbstractText": "Past research in the Western context found that people with dementia search for digital dementia information in peer-reviewed medical research articles, dementia advocacy and medical organizations, and blogs written by other people with dementia. This past work also demonstrated that people with dementia do not perceive English digital dementia information as emotionally or cognitively accessible. In this study, we sought to investigate the readability; linguistic, psychological, and emotional characteristics; and target audiences of digital dementia information. We conducted a textual analysis of 3 different types of text-based digital dementia information written in English: 300 medical articles, 35 websites, and 50 blogs. We assessed the text's readability using the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level measurements, as well as tone, analytical thinking, clout, authenticity, and word frequencies using a natural language processing tool, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Generator. We also conducted a thematic analysis to categorize the target audiences for each information source and used these categorizations for further statistical analysis. The median Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability score and Flesch Reading Ease score for all types of information (N=1139) were 12.1 and 38.6, respectively, revealing that the readability scores of all 3 information types were higher than the minimum requirement. We found that medical articles had significantly (P=.05) higher word count and analytical thinking scores as well as significantly lower clout, authenticity, and emotional tone scores than websites and blogs. Further, blogs had significantly (P=.48) higher word count and authenticity scores but lower analytical scores than websites. Using thematic analysis, we found that most of the blogs (156/227, 68.7%) and web pages (399/612, 65.2%) were targeted at people with dementia. Website information targeted at a general audience had significantly lower readability scores. In addition, website information targeted at people with dementia had higher word count and lower emotional tone ratings. The information on websites targeted at caregivers had significantly higher clout and lower authenticity scores. Our findings indicate that there is an abundance of digital dementia information written in English that is targeted at people with dementia, but this information is not readable by a general audience. This is problematic considering that people with <12 years of education are at a higher risk of developing dementia. Further, our findings demonstrate that digital dementia information written in English has a negative tone, which may be a contributing factor to the mental health crisis many people with dementia face after receiving a diagnosis. Therefore, we call for content creators to lower readability scores to make the information more accessible to a general audience and to focus their efforts on providing information in a way that does not perpetuate overly negative narratives of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "Fatty acids are metabolized by \u03b2-oxidation within the \"mitochondrial ketogenic pathway\" (MKP) to generate \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body. BHB can be generated by most cells but largely by hepatocytes following exercise, fasting, or ketogenic diet consumption. BHB has been shown to modulate systemic and brain inflammation; however, its direct effects on microglia have been little studied. We investigated the impact of BHB on A\u03b2 oligomer (A\u03b2O)-stimulated human iPS-derived microglia (hiMG), a model relevant to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). HiMG responded to A\u03b2O with proinflammatory activation, which was mitigated by BHB at physiological concentrations of 0.1-2\u2009mM. A\u03b2O stimulated glycolytic transcripts, suppressed genes in the \u03b2-oxidation pathway, and induced over-expression of AD-relevant p46Shc, an endogenous inhibitor of thiolase, actions that are expected to suppress MKP. A\u03b2O also triggered mitochondrial Ca2+ increase, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. BHB potently ameliorated all the above mitochondrial changes and rectified the MKP, resulting in reduced inflammasome activation and recovery of the phagocytotic function impaired by A\u03b2O. These results indicate that microglia MKP can be induced to modulate microglia immunometabolism, and that BHB can remedy \"keto-deficiency\" resulting from MKP suppression and shift microglia away from proinflammatory mitochondrial metabolism. These effects of BHB may contribute to the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet intervention in aged mice and in human subjects with mild AD.",

The enzyme neprilysin (NEP), crucial for A\u03b2 degradation, decreases with age and in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, leading to increased A\u03b2 build-up. This study hypothesized the targeting of enzyme HDAC6, believed to influence NEP activity. An in-silico study was conducted using an FDA-approved drug database, with the focus on their interaction with the HDAC6 structure. Among tested ligands, Panobinostat showed the most favourable interaction with HDAC6. In-vitro experiments on the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line confirmed these findings, with Panobinostat inhibiting HDAC6, enhancing NEP levels, and reducing A\u03b2 load. The study suggests Panobinostat as a potential Alzheimer's therapeutic agent, mitigating A\u03b2 accumulation via NEP upregulation.

Therefore, inhibiting tau protein aggregation is a potential strategy for preventing the progression of these disorders. In this study, sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), an antibiotic that easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and interacts with tau protein, was tested for its ability to inhibit tau aggregation in\u00a0vitro. Various multi-spectroscopic techniques including XRD, LDH cytotoxicity colorimetric assay, and microscopic imaging were employed. The results showed that SMZ effectively interacts with tau protein through hydrogen and van der Waals interactions. It also effectively inhibited tau protein aggregation in\u00a0vitro and significantly reduced toxicity in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Molecular docking and MD simulation results suggested that SMZ may reduce tau protein aggregation by interacting with the PHF6 motif. Overall, these findings indicate that SMZ has therapeutic potential as a tau protein aggregation inhibitor, at least under in\u00a0vitro conditions. These findings suggest that SMZ has potential as a treatment for neurodegenerative disorders involving tau protein aggregation.

However, the effect of 1,7-diphenyl-4-hepten-3-one (C1), a natural diarylheptanoid, on AD is unclear. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic effect of C1 on APP/PS1 mice and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2)-induced HT22 cells. Our findings showed that C1 attenuated cognitive impairment and mitigated pathological damage in APP/PS1 mice.

In vitro experiments showed that C1 can improve the proliferation of A\u03b2-induced HT22 cells and decrease the levels of pyroptosis-related proteins in them. When Nrf2 was silenced, the positive effects of C1 in inhibiting pyroptosis were inhibited. Particularly, the production of pyroptosis-associated proteins, including NLRP3, GSDMD, and caspase-1, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules, including IL-1 and IL-18, were increased. Altogether, these findings indicate that C1 can mitigate AD-like pathology via the inhibition of pyroptosis by activating the Nrf2 pathway.

        "AbstractText": "Dementia in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive neurological condition affecting millions worldwide. The amphiphilic molecule GM2 gangliosides are abundant in the human brain and play important roles in neuronal development, intercellular recognition, myelin stabilization, and signal transduction. GM2 ganglioside's degradation requires hexosaminidase A (HexA), a heterodimer composed of an \u03b1 subunit encoded by HEXA and a \u03b2 subunit encoded by HEXB. The hydrolysis of GM2 also requires a non-enzymatic protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2-AP), encoded by GM2A. Pathogenic mutations of HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A are responsible for autosomal recessive diseases known as GM2 gangliosidosis, caused by the excessive intralysosomal accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. In AD, PD and DLB, GM2 ganglioside accumulation is reported to facilitate A\u03b2 and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation into toxic oligomers and plaques through activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as protein kinase C (PKC) and oxidative stress factors. This review explored the potential role of GM2 ganglioside alteration in toxic protein aggregations and its related signaling pathways leading to neurodegenerative diseases. Further review explored potential therapeutic approaches, which include synthetic and phytomolecules targeting GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the brain, holding a promise for providing new and effective management for dementia.",

However, the existing TCCA models fail to adequately address the heterogeneity present in real-world tensor data, such as brain imaging data collected from diverse groups characterized by factors like sex and race. Consequently, these models may yield biased outcomes. In order to surmount this constraint, we propose a novel approach called Multi-Group TCCA (MG-TCCA), which enables the joint analysis of multiple subgroups. By incorporating a dual sparsity structure and a block coordinate ascent algorithm, our MG-TCCA method effectively addresses heterogeneity and leverages information across different groups to identify consistent signals. This novel approach facilitates the quantification of shared and individual structures, reduces data dimensionality, and enables visual exploration. To empirically validate our approach, we conduct a study focused on investigating correlations between two brain positron emission tomography (PET) modalities (AV-45 and FDG) within an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort. Our results demonstrate that MG-TCCA surpasses traditional TCCA in identifying sex-specific cross-modality imaging correlations.

The stigmatization of people with ADRD can also impact caregivers' stress, while their support-seeking strategies may mitigate negative impacts of burden on their health. To examine hypothesized relationships, the present study considered whether different dimensions of ADRD family stigma influenced the association between a care recipient's behavioral symptoms and their family caregiver's perceived burden and if direct support seeking explained a connection between caregiver burden and well-being. Family caregivers (n\u2009=\u2009375) completed a Qualtrics survey. Path analysis revealed ADRD behavioral symptoms predicted both caregiver and layperson forms of stigma. Layperson stigma also intervened between behavioral symptoms and caregiver burden. Direct support seeking mediated the association between caregiver burden and well-being. Findings underscore the utility of including stigma within ADRD caregiver stress models and studying caregiver health from network and communication perspectives.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of tango-therapy in gait speed, functional mobility, balance, falls, ability to perform activities of daily living and quality of life. A randomised controlled trial with 31 participants living in a specialised dementia unit, aged 65 to 93\u00a0years old, who were randomly assigned to tango group (IG) or physical exercise group (CG). The primary outcome was gait speed and Timed Up and Go test. The secondary outcomes include the Short Physical Performance Battery, the ability to perform activities of daily living (Katz Index) and quality of life (Quality of life in Alzheimer Disease). Measurements were performed at baseline, and after one and three months of training. After 3\u00a0months, IG improved gait speed (p\u2009=\u20090.016), implying a statistically significant difference between groups in favour of IG (p\u2009=\u20090.003). CG significantly worsened the time to complete the TUG (p\u2009=\u20090.039). Both groups declined in their ability to perform activities of daily living, being statistically significant only in the CG (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Tango interventions showed efficacy in improving gait speed and in mitigating the decline in functional mobility and ADL skill capacities. Allowing older people with dementia access to non-pharmacological interventions may be a successful strategy to prevent functional decline. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT05744011).",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older individuals. AD is characterized pathologically by amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, with associated loss of synapses and neurons, which eventually results in dementia. Many of the early attempts to develop treatments for AD focused on A\u03b2, but a lack of efficacy of these treatments in terms of slowing disease progression led to a change of strategy towards targeting of tau pathology. Given that tau shows a stronger correlation with symptom severity than does A\u03b2, targeting of tau is more likely to be efficacious once cognitive decline begins. Anti-tau therapies initially focused on post-translational modifications, inhibition of tau aggregation and stabilization of microtubules. However, trials of many potential drugs were discontinued because of toxicity and/or lack of efficacy. Currently, the majority of tau-targeting agents in clinical trials are immunotherapies. In this Review, we provide an update on the results from the initial immunotherapy trials and an overview of new therapeutic candidates that are in clinical development, as well as considering future directions for tau-targeting therapies.",

Deep metric learning has emerged as a promising approach for addressing these challenges by improving data representation. In this study, we propose a joint triplet loss model with a semi-hard constraint (JTSC) to represent data in a small number of samples. JTSC strictly selects semi-hard samples by switching anchors and positive samples during the learning process in triplet embedding and combines a triplet loss function with an angular loss function. Our results indicate that JTSC significantly improves the number of appropriately represented samples during training when applied to the gene expression data of AD and to cancer stage prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using an embedding vector from JTSC as an input to the classifiers for AD and cancer stage prediction significantly improves classification performance by extracting more accurate features. In conclusion, we show that feature embedding through JTSC can aid in classification when there are a small number of samples compared to a larger number of features.",

This study aimed to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of TBI in VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) enrollees. Participants included a multi-ancestry cohort (European, African, and Hispanic ancestries; N\u2009=\u2009304,485; 111,494 TBI cases, 192,991 controls). TBI was assessed using MVP survey data and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from the Veterans Health Administration's electronic health record. GWAS was performed using logistic regression in PLINK, and meta-analyzed in METAL. FUMA was used for post-GWAS analysis. Genomic structural equation modeling (gSEM) was conducted to investigate underlying genetic associations with TBI, and bivariate MiXeR was used to estimate phenotype specific and shared polygenicity. SNP-based heritability was 0.060 (SE\u2009=\u20090.004, p\u2009=\u20097.83\u00d710-66). GWAS analysis identified 15 genome-wide significant (GWS) loci at p\u2009<\u20095\u00d710-8. Gene-based analyses revealed 14 gene-wide significant genes; top genes included NCAM1, APOE, FTO, and FOXP2. Gene tissue expression analysis identified the brain as significantly enriched, particularly in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Genetic correlations with TBI were significant for risk-taking behaviors and psychiatric disorders, but generally not significant for the neurocognitive variables investigated. gSEM analysis revealed stronger associations with risk-taking traits than with psychiatric traits. Finally, the genetic architecture of TBI was similar to polygenic psychiatric disorders. Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease showed much less polygenicity, however, the proportion of shared variance with TBI was high. This first well-powered GWAS of TBI identified 15 loci including genes relevant to TBI biology, and showed that TBI is a heritable trait with comparable genetic architecture and high genetic correlation with psychiatric traits.

Sodium benzoate is a promising NMDAR enhancer and has been proven to be a novel, safe and efficient therapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in addition to the role of sodium benzoate as an NMDA enhancer, other mechanisms of sodium benzoate in treating AD are still unclear. To elucidate the potential mechanisms of sodium benzoate in Alzheimer's disease, this study employed label-free quantitative proteomics to analyze serum samples from AD cohorts with and without sodium benzoate treatment. The serum proteins from each patient were separated into 24 fractions using an immobilized pH gradient, digested with trypsin and then subjected to nanoLC\u2012MS/MS to analyze the proteome of all patients. The nanoLC\u2012MS/MS data were obtained with a label-free quantitative proteomic approach. Proteins with fold changes were analyzed with STRING and Cytoscape to find key protein networks/processes and hub proteins. Our analysis identified 861 and 927 protein groups in the benzoate-treatment cohort and the placebo cohort, respectively. The results demonstrated that sodium benzoate had the most significant effect on the complement and coagulation cascade pathways, amyloidosis disease, immune responses and lipid metabolic processes. Moreover, Transthyretin (TTR), Fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA), Haptoglobin (HP), Apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB), Fibrinogen beta chain (FGB), Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) were identified as hub proteins in the protein\u2012protein interaction networks.

Although their advent a few decades back, extensive exploration of various ailments or disorders began recently. The drawbacks of current chemotherapies and irradiation treatments such as drug resistance and damage to healthy tissues have enabled the rise of the peptides as quest for better prospects. The chemical tunability and smaller size make them easy to design selectively for target tissues. Other remarkable properties include antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, protection from hemorrhage stroke, and as therapeutic agents for gastric disorders, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Despite these unmatched properties, their practical applicability is often hindered due to their weak susceptibility to enzymatic digestion, degradation in serum, metabolism in the liver, clearance by the kidney, and immunogenic reactions. There are several methods adapted in order to increase the half-life of peptides such as chemical modifications, fusing with Fc fragment, change in amino acid composition, and by using carrier-based delivery. Among these, nano-carrier-mediated encapsulation not only increases the half-life of the peptides in vivo but also it aids in the targeted delivery. They are also efficient in delivering the therapeutic molecules across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), despite its structural complexity.

High hostility, high vulnerability, low excitement seeking, and low competence were associated with worse cognitive performance on all tasks. Impulsivity-related facets had weak and differential associations, with self-discipline negatively associated with accuracy and deliberation negatively associated with speed. These associations remained largely unchanged when accounting for lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity). The associations with cognition were stronger in older people for impulsiveness, deliberation, and hostility, while stronger in younger people for excitement seeking, self-discipline, and vulnerability. In a large population-based sample with a broad age range, the associations of personality facets with cognitive functioning had small effect sizes, were independent of lifestyle factors, and varied with age and among facets within the same personality domain.

While peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is produced excessively and emerges earlier than A\u03b2 plaques in the progression of AD, it is thus significant to sensitively detect ONOO- for early diagnosis of AD and its pathological research. Herein, we unveiled an integrated sensor for monitoring ONOO-, which consisted of a commercially available field-effect transistor (FET) and a high-performance multi-engineered graphene extended-gate (EG) electrode. In the configuration of the presented EG electrode, laser-induced graphene (LIG) intercalated with MnO2 nanoparticles (MnO2/LIG) can improve the electrical properties of LIG and the sensitivity of the sensor, and graphene oxide (GO)-MnO2/Hemin nanozyme with ONOO- isomerase activity can selectively trigger the isomerization of ONOO- to NO3-. With this synergistic effect, our EG-FET sensor can respond to the ONOO- with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, taking advantage of our EG-FET sensor, we modularly assembled a portable sensing platform for wireless tracking ONOO- levels in the brain tissue of AD transgenic mice at earlier stages before massive A\u03b2 plaques appeared, and we systematically explored the complex role of ONOO- in the occurrence and development of AD.",

Studies indicate that antipsychotics interact with facilitated glucose transporters (GLUT), including GLUT1, and that GLUT1 BBB expression decreases in AD. We tested the hypotheses that amisulpride (charge: +1) interacts with GLUT1, and that BBB transport of amisulpride is compromised in AD. GLUT1 substrates, GLUT1 inhibitors and GLUT-interacting antipsychotics were identified by literature review and their physicochemical characteristics summarised. Interactions between amisulpride and GLUT1 were studied using in silico approaches and the human cerebral endothelial cell line, hCMEC/D3. Brain distribution of [3H]amisulpride was determined using in situ perfusion in wild type (WT) and 5xFamilial AD (5xFAD) mice. With transmission electron microscopy (TEM) we investigated brain capillary degeneration in WT mice, 5xFAD mice and human samples. Western blots determined BBB transporter expression in mouse and human. Literature review revealed that, although D-glucose has no charge, charged molecules can interact with GLUT1. GLUT1 substrates are smaller (184.95\u00b16.45g/mol) than inhibitors (325.50\u00b114.40g/mol) and GLUT-interacting antipsychotics (369.38\u00b116.04). Molecular docking showed beta-D-glucose (free energy binding: -15.39kcal/mol) and amisulpride (-29.04kcal/mol) interact with GLUT1. Amisulpride did not affect [14C]D-glucose hCMEC/D3 accumulation. [3H]amisulpride uptake into the brain (except supernatant) of 5xFAD mice compared to WT remained unchanged. TEM revealed brain capillary degeneration in human AD. There was no difference in GLUT1 or P-glycoprotein BBB expression between WT and 5xFAD mice. In contrast, caudate P-glycoprotein, but not GLUT1, expression was decreased in human AD capillaries versus controls. This study provides new details about the BBB transport of amisulpride, evidence that amisulpride interacts with GLUT1 and that BBB transporter expression is altered in AD. This suggests that antipsychotics could potentially exacerbate the cerebral hypometabolism in AD.

For this, Male Wistar rats received STZ (ICV, 3\u00a0mg/kg, bilateral, 5ul per site, aCFS vehicle) and were treated with taurine (100\u00a0mg/kg orally, 1 time per day, saline vehicle) for 25 days. The animals were divided into 4 groups: vehicle (VE), taurine (TAU), ICV-STZ (STZ) and ICV-STZ plus taurine (STZ\u2009+\u2009TAU). At the end of taurine treatment, short- and long-term memory were assessed by performance on object recognition and Y-maze tasks. Insulin receptor (IR) was evaluated by immunoperoxidase while mature neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP, S100B, SOX9), and microglia (Iba-1) were evaluated by immunofluorescence. STZ induced worse spatial and recognition memory (INDEX) in YM and ORT tasks. Taurine protected against STZ-induced memory impairment. SDAT reduced the population of mature neurons as well as increased astrocytic and microglial reactivity, and taurine protected against these STZ-induced effects, mainly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Taurine increases IR expression in the hippocampus, and protects against the reduction in the density of this receptor in CA1 induced by STZ. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that taurine is able to enhance memory, up-regulates IR in the hippocampus, protects the neuron population, and reduces the astrogliosis found in SDAT.",

In this study, the AD model rats were established by combining intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose (150 mg/kg/day) and intracerebral injection of A\u03b225-35 (10 \u03bcL) to investigate the meliorative effect of KXS on AD and explore its mechanism. After 1-month KXS treatment, Morris water maze test showed that different doses of KXS all improved the cognitive impairment of AD rats. The results of hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, and Tunnel staining showed that the neuron injury in the hippocampal CA1 region of the AD rats was markedly improved after KXS treatment. Concurrently, KXS reversed the levels of biochemical indexes of AD rats. Furthermore, the protein expressions of Wnt1 and \u03b2-catenin in KXS groups were remarkably increased, while the expressions of Bax and caspase-3 were significantly decreased. Besides, KXS-medicated serum reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and reactive oxygen species and regulated the protein expressions of \u03b2-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), p-GSK-3\u03b2, Bax, and caspase-3 in A\u03b225-35-induced pheochromocytoma cells.

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of chalcones and huprine derivatives in mitigating amyloid-\u03b2 peptide-associated toxicity and preserving membrane integrity, crucial for cellular homeostasis. The interaction of these compounds with lipid bilayers may modulate biological responses, opening a new realm of investigation in membrane-centric phenomena. This approach not only broadens the mechanistic understanding of bioactive compounds but also underscores the need for a paradigm shift in AD research, focusing on both intracellular targets and plasma membrane protection for more effective treatment strategies.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Associations of cataract, cataract surgery with dementia risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 448,140 participants.",
        "AbstractText": "Cataract is the leading cause of blindness around the world. Previous investigations have assessed the relationship between cataract, cataract surgery and dementia risk, but their results remain controversial. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations between cataract, cataract surgery and the risk of dementia. We systemically screened the literature from three electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL until April 2023. The data were collected by two independent researchers. The hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) from eligible studies with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted into the risk ratios (RRs), which were pooled using the random-effects model. A total of nine studies with 448,140 participants reported the associations between cataract or cataract surgery and the risk of dementia were included in this meta-analysis. The outcomes of our pooled analysis indicated that cataract was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (RR\u2009=\u20091.24, 95% CI, 1.14-1.35, p\u2009<\u2009.00001), Alzheimer's disease (RR\u2009=\u20091.22, 95% CI, 1.10-1.35, p\u2009=\u2009.0002) and vascular dementia (RR\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% CI, 1.01-1.66, p\u2009=\u2009.04). Cataract surgery is associated with a reduction of the dementia risk (RR\u2009=\u20090.74, 95% CI, 0.67-0.81, p\u2009<\u2009.00001). Current evidence from the existing studies supports that cataract is associated with an increased risk of dementia, and cataract surgery may be instrumental in reducing the risk of dementia in patients with cataract.",

Individuals older than 65\u2009years, without unspecified retinal vascular occlusion or dementia were included from 1998 to 2020 and followed until 2022. We calculated the incidence rate (IR) and performed a Cox regression analysis with a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for RVO (exposure) as a marker of all-cause dementia adjusted for systemic comorbidity. We identified 19\u2009669 individuals with RVO who had a higher prevalence of systemic comorbidity at inclusion compared to those without RVO (n\u2009=\u20092\u2009185\u2009483).

        "AbstractText": "Many treatment initiatives, like herbal products and their active ingredients, aim to alleviate neurodegeneration to increase cognitive functions. Kaempferol may be a candidate molecule for treating neurodegeneration because of its antioxidant effects. In the present study, we examined the molecular changes associated with kaempferol's memory\u2011enhancing effects on streptozotocin (STZ)\u2011induced neurodegeneration. After intracerebroventricular STZ injection in Long\u2011Evans male rats, intraperitoneal kaempferol was administered for 12 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to measure learning and memory performance in the rats, and proteins related to memory formation were investigated in the hippocampi with western blotting. Kaempferol improved learning performance and memory decline in STZ\u2011treated rats. At the molecular level, STZ\u2011induced neurodegeneration resulted in a decrease in the expression of GAD67, reelin, and phosphorylated\u2011NMDAR. However, kaempferol treatment ameliorated these changes by enhancing their levels similar to the controls. While neither STZ injection nor kaempferol treatment produced any significant change in phosphorylated\u2011CAMKII levels, they increased the expression of klotho and prealbumin. These results show that kaempferol has positive effects on memory loss, affecting synaptic plasticity by ameliorating both the levels and activity of memory\u2011relevant molecules through reelin signaling. In summary, this study provides a guide to future studies by examining in detail the healing effect of kaempferol as a candidate molecule in the treatment of neurodegeneration, such as that observed in Alzheimer's disease.",

This systematic review aims to summarize current understanding of the perceptions, knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about ADRD and brain health of Latinos to inform public health efforts addressing disparities. Searches were completed across six databases (Medline, PsycINFO, WoS, LILACS, ProQUEST, and CINAHL). Studies were required to capture attitudes and/or knowledge of ADRD or brain health among US-based Latino adults who were not cognitively impaired and were not caregivers or healthcare providers. Results were synthesized narratively. A total of 5528 unique records were identified. Following de-duplication and screening, 24 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Overall, knowledge about brain health and ADRD among Latinos is quite mixed. A consistent finding was that participants recognized memory loss as a symptom of cognitive impairment, but demonstrated limited recognition of other signs of impairment. The studies also highlighted variable knowledge of protective factors for maintaining brain health. Opportunities exist to increase knowledge of ADRD signs and symptoms, and awareness of risk and protective factors. Given the heterogeneity of Latinos in the USA, more research is warranted to better elucidate nuances in conceptualizations of brain health and aging among diverse Latino subgroups.",

        "AbstractText": "Observational studies suggest psychosocial factors such as social support and loneliness are associated with vulnerability for cognitive decline in older adults. However, because of racial/ethnic homogeneity in prior studies focused on identifying these associations in predominantly White cohorts, less is known about the generalizability of these putative psychosocial mechanisms in a diverse population. Thus, we evaluated whether lower levels of loneliness were associated with better cognitive performance in our sample. We conducted a cross-sectional study using 541 participants from (Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa) Dementia Cohort. Participants' self-reported loneliness as exposure. Cognitive performance is measured using a neuropsychological battery as the outcome. Raw scores were converted into Z scores, and global cognitive function was created. Generalized estimated equation and robust regression analysis). Better global cognitive function is associated with a lower level of loneliness at (\u03b2 = -0.0131, 95 % CI -0.1990, -0.0071) after adjustment for age, gender, and education. Lower levels of loneliness were associated with varying cognitive domains after adjustment for age, gender, and education; and persisted after additional adjustments of vascular risk factors. Self-reported lower loneliness was associated with higher levels of cognitive performance in a rural South African cohort of Black older adults. Although these findings and the potential of reverse causality need to be further validated, our results suggest that an intervention study may be merited to assess whether reducing loneliness lessens vulnerability to cognitive decline.",

        "AbstractText": "The 523 poly-T length polymorphism (rs10524523) in TOMM40 has been reported to influence longitudinal cognitive test performance within APOE \u03b53/3 carriers. The results from prior studies are inconsistent. It is also unclear whether specific APOE and TOMM40 genotypes contribute to heterogeneity in longitudinal cognitive performance during the preclinical stages of AD. To determine the effects of these genes on longitudinal cognitive change in early preclinical stages of AD, we used the clinical trial data from the recently concluded TOMMORROW study to examine the effects of APOE and TOMM40 genotypes on neuropsychological test performance. A phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Academic affiliated and private research clinics in Australia, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Cognitively normal older adults aged 65 to 83. Pioglitazone tablet. Participants from the TOMMORROW trial were stratified based on APOE genotype (APOE \u03b53/3, APOE \u03b53/4, APOE \u03b54/4). APOE \u03b53/3 carriers were further stratified by TOMM40'523 genotype. The final analysis dataset consists of 1,330 APOE \u03b53/3 carriers and 7,001 visits. Linear mixed models were used to compare the rates of decline in cognition across APOE groups and the APOE \u03b53/3 carriers with different TOMM40'523 genotypes. APOE \u03b53/4 and APOE \u03b54/4 genotypes compared with the APOE \u03b53/3 genotype were associated with worse performance on measures of global cognition, episodic memory, and expressive language. Further, over the four years of observation, the APOE \u03b53/3 carriers with the TOMM40'523-S/S genotype showed better global cognition and accelerated rates of cognitive decline on tests of global cognition, executive function, and attentional processing compared to APOE \u03b53/3 carriers with TOMM40'523-S/VL and VL/VL genotypes and compared to the APOE \u03b53/4 and APOE \u03b54/4 carriers.

This manuscript presents the Brain Health Support Program Study protocol. Twelve-month prospective multi-center longitudinal study to evaluate a fully remote web-based educational intervention. Participants will subsequently be part of a Platform Trial Cohort and may be eligible to participate in further dementia prevention clinical trials. Three hundred fifty older adults who are cognitively unimpaired or have mild cognitive impairment, with at least 1 well established dementia risk factor. Participants engage in the Brain Health Support Program intervention for 45-weeks and complete pre/post intervention measures. This intervention is designed to convey best available evidence for dementia prevention, consists of 181 chapters within 8 modules that are progressively delivered, and is available online in English and French. The program has been developed as a collaborative effort by investigators with recognized expertise in the program's content areas, along with input from older-adult citizen advisors. This study utilizes adapted remote assessments with accessible technologies (e.g. videoconferencing, cognitive testing via computer and mobile phone, wearable devices to track physical activity and sleep, self-administered saliva sample collection). The primary outcome is change in dementia literacy, as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale. Secondary outcomes include change in self-efficacy; engagement using the online program; user satisfaction ratings; and evaluation of usability and acceptance. Exploratory outcomes include changes in attitudes toward dementia, modifiable risk factors, performance on the Neuropsychological Test Battery, performance on self-administered online cognitive assessments, and levels of physical activity and sleep; success of the national recruitment plan; and the distribution of age adjusted polygenic hazard scores. This fully remote study provides an accessible approach to research with all study activities being completed in the participants' home environment. This approach may reduce barriers to participation, provide an easier and less demanding participant experience, and reach a broader geography with recruitment from all regions of Canada.

Recruitment challenges for these populations limit generalizability of findings. This study explores barriers and facilitators to signing up for an AD participant recruitment registry website intended to optimize recruitment of these adults. The registry is geared toward recruitment on smartphones and tablets (mobile devices), as research suggests that mobile-first approaches may be more successful within these populations. In 2020, we conducted four focus groups (n = 39) and an online survey (n = 1010) with Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino adults. The survey also included Whites as a comparison group. Focus groups were in-person at research facilities in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Los Angeles, California. The online survey was distributed by a survey panel company to participants nationwide. Black/African American (n = 360), Hispanic/Latino (n = 359), or White (n = 330) individuals, 45-75 years old, who self-reported not having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, or AD. Barriers and facilitators explored in the focus groups and survey were related to health and AD (e.g., AD-related concerns and past participation/willingness to participate in health or AD studies); current use of mobile devices (e.g., comfort using devices and receptivity to the AD recruitment registry); and participant characteristics and beliefs (e.g., demographics, health literacy level, and trust in government and the scientific community). The focus groups and survey revealed similar findings. Participants commonly use mobile devices to go online and perform health-related activities. They were aware of AD, expressed concerns with developing it, and were willing to participate in AD-related studies (motivated by personal connection to AD, altruism, and compensation). When presented with the AD recruitment registry, most provided positive feedback (e.g., easy to use and informative) and shared an interest in joining. Barriers to joining the registry with a mobile device included complex or multistep enrollment processes, beliefs that studies are primarily for those with a specific disease, and confusion about how studies can prevent AD among those low-risk for AD. The focus groups also revealed that Black/African American participants expressed more hesitation than Hispanic/Latinos in joining the registry due to greater distrust in the government and scientific community. Recruiting more Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino participants into AD studies is vitally important. This mixed methods study suggests that adults in these underrepresented groups are motivated to prevent AD and willing to sign up for an AD participant recruitment registry using mobile devices. Most barriers to joining a registry can be addressed through slight modifications to the registry's design and functionality and by adding content. These findings can help enhance the appeal of joining AD recruitment registries to ultimately enroll more diverse, representative groups of participants and increase the generalizability of AD study findings.",

In CU, only MetaT tau SUVR was significantly associated with change in AIBL-PACC (\u03b2 = -0.22, p = 0.008). Screening pT+ CI participants into a trial could lead to 24% reduction in sample size compared to screening with PET for A+ and 6-13% compared to screening with PET for T+ (different regions). This would translate to an 81-83% biomarker test cost-saving assuming the p217+tau test cost one-fifth of a PET scan. In a trial requiring PET A+ or T+, p217+tau pre-screening followed by PET in those who were pT+ would cost more in the CI group, compared to 26-38% biomarker test cost-saving in the CU. Substantial cost reduction can be achieved using p217+tau alone to select participants with MCI or mild dementia for a clinical trial designed to slow cognitive decline over two years, compared to participant selection by PET. In pre-clinical AD trials, p217+tau provides significant cost-saving if used as a pre-screening measure for PET A+ or T+ but in MCI/mild dementia trials this may add to cost both in testing and in the increased number of participants needed for testing.",

English or Spanish speaking people aged 55-89 years from all ethnic groups and considered to have age-related cognitive decline are eligible. Neuropyschological tests are done at baseline and after 6 months of intervention. Participants are contacted monthly by telephone to monitor safety, assess motivation and promote compliance. The primary outcome is feasibility determined by assessing recruitment rate, recruitment time, adherence rate and retention rate. A comprehensive set of neuropyschological measures will provide a broad assessment of cognitive function, including verbal memory, processing speed, and attention and executive function. Self-reported questionnaires are used to assess quality of life. This pilot trial will provide data to guide inform selection of participants and outcome measures in future studies in age-related cognitive decline.",

        "AbstractText": "Lower blood levels of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are correlated with worse cognitive functions, particularly among APOE \u03b54 carriers. Whether DHA supplementation in APOE \u03b54 carriers with limited DHA consumption and dementia risk factors can delay or slow down disease progression when started before the onset of clinical dementia is not known. PreventE4 is a double-blind, single site, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in cognitively unimpaired individuals with limited omega-3 consumption and dementia risk factors (n=368). Its objectives are to determine (1) whether carrying the APOE \u03b54 allele is associated with lower delivery of DHA to the brain; and (2) whether high dose DHA supplementation affects brain imaging biomarkers of AD and cognitive function. 365 cognitively unimpaired individuals between 55 and 80 (mean age 66) were randomized to 2 grams of DHA per day or identically appearing placebo for a period of 2 years. Half the participants were asked to complete lumbar punctures at baseline and 6-month visits to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The primary trial outcome measure is the change in CSF DHA to arachidonic acid ratio after 6 months of the intervention (n=181). Secondary trial outcomes include the change in functional and structural connectivity using resting state functional MRI at 24 months (n=365). Exploratory outcomes include the change in Repeatable Battery of the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status at 24 months (n=365). Findings from PreventE4 will clarify the brain delivery of DHA in individuals carrying the APOE \u03b54 allele with implications for dementia prevention strategies.

        "AbstractText": "S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is a pivotal metabolite in multiple pathways required for neuronal homeostasis, several of which are compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Correction of the SAMe deficiency that is characteristic of the AD brain may attenuate or prevent pathological processes driving AD-associated neurodegeneration including aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation and DNA hypomethylation. The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that daily treatment with 400 mg oral SAMe for 180 days will lead to a greater reduction from baseline in plasma levels of p-tau181 compared to placebo in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD. This is a phase II, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 60 participants with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SAMe or matching placebo, to be taken as an adjunct to their AD standard of care. The primary outcome is change in plasma p-tau181 concentration between baseline and following 180 days of treatment, which will be compared between the active and placebo group. Secondary outcomes are the safety of SAMe administration (incidence of serious adverse events), change from baseline in cognitive performance (as measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status), and epigenetic changes in DNA methylation. Demonstration of effective and safe lowering of plasma p-tau181 with SAMe in this phase II trial would pave the way for an exciting field of translational research and a larger phase III trial.",

We tested a conceptually driven communication approach targeting barriers and facilitators to research participation vs. standard education. In this 2-phase project, input from the minority advisory board of the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center informed development of 2 brief health communication videos which differentially focused on research barriers and facilitators (POWER) versus an education control (Phase 1). In Phase 2, a randomized prospective survey compared POWER vs. an active comparator control on pre/post video change in dementia knowledge, cumulative barriers, and facilitators to dementia research, and change in research readiness measured by the Transtheoretical behavior change model. Changes in outcomes were evaluated using two group by two time points repeated measure analysis of variance (RMANOVA) controlling for age, gender, race, and education. The pre-video sample (n=242) had mean age of 57.6 (SD17.2) years, mostly female (n=181, 74.8%), 42.6% non-white. The analyzable sample who completed both pre and post assessments comprised n=102 in the POWER and n=105 in the control group. Non-white participants made up 41.1% of the analyzable POWER (n=51) and 44.1% (n= 52) of controls. Adjusted for age, gender, race and education, controls had a greater increase in dementia knowledge (p=0.004). There was a significant reduction in barriers for POWER (p=.044) vs. control. There were no differences in research facilitators and research readiness between POWER vs. control. Among African Americans (n=59, 28.5% of the analyzable sample) there was a trend for improved dementia knowledge (p=.059) favoring control and in research readiness (p=.051), favoring POWER.

        "AbstractText": "ACD856 is a positive allosteric modulator of tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) receptors which has shown to have pro-cognitive and anti-depressant-like effects in various animal models. It is currently in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders where cognition is impaired and is also considered for indications such as depression or other neuropsychiatric diseases. ACD856 has a novel mechanism of action modulating the activity of the Trk-receptors, resulting in increased stimulation of the neurotrophin signaling pathways. Previous studies applying single intravenous and oral doses of ACD856 indicate that ACD856 is safe and well-tolerated by healthy volunteer subjects, and that it has suitable safety and pharmacokinetic properties for further clinical development. To investigate the safety and tolerability of 7 days of treatment with multiple ascending oral doses of ACD856 in healthy subjects, and to characterize its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. In addition, pharmacodynamic effects of ACD856 using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as an indicator for central target engagement were assessed. This was a prospective, phase I, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized study of the safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics of multiple ascending oral doses of ACD856 in healthy subjects. ACD856 or placebo were administered in 3 ascending dose cohorts of 8 subjects. Within each cohort, subjects were randomized to receive either ACD856 (n=6) or placebo (n=2). The study was conducted at a First-in-Human unit in Sweden. Twenty-four healthy male and female subjects. The study medication was administered as an oral solution, with ACD856 or the same contents without the active ingredient (placebo). The dose levels ranged from 10 mg to 90 mg. ACD856 was administered once daily for 7 days, targeting steady state. Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events, laboratory, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, assessment of stool frequency and questionnaires to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as suicidal ideation and behavior. In addition, cardiodynamic ECGs were extracted to evaluate cardiac safety. PK parameters were calculated based on measured concentrations of ACD856 in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Metabolite profiling, characterization and analysis was performed based on and urine samples. qEEG was recorded for patients in the two highest dose cohorts (30 and 90 mg/day) as a pharmacodynamic assessment to explore central target engagement. Treatment with ACD856 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. No treatment emergent or dose related trends were observed for any of the safety assessments. ACD856 was rapidly absorbed and reached maximum plasma exposure at 30 to 45 minutes after administration. Steady state was reached before Day 6, with an elimination half-life at steady state of approximately 20 hours. At steady state, ACD856 exhibited accumulation ratios for Cmax and AUC of approximately 1.6 and 1.9 respectively. The exposure, Cmax and AUC0-24, increased proportionally with the dose. There was no unchanged ACD856 detected in urine. The metabolic pattern in urine and plasma was similar, and in alignment with the metabolites observed in preclinical toxicology studies. The level of ACD856 measured in CSF at steady state increased with dose, indicating Central Nervous System (CNS) exposure at relevant levels for pharmacodynamic effects. ACD856 demonstrated significant dose-dependent treatment-associated changes on qEEG parameters. Specifically, increase of the relative theta power and decrease of the fast alpha and beta power was observed, leading to an acceleration of the delta+theta centroid and an increase in the theta/beta ratio. ACD856 was well tolerated at the tested dose levels (10-90 mg/daily for 7 days) in healthy subjects. The compound has a robust pharmacokinetic profile, with rapid absorption and dose-dependent exposure. ACD856 was shown to pass the blood-brain-barrier, reach relevant exposure in the CNS and to induce dose-dependent treatment-related changes on qEEG parameters, indicating central target engagement.",

This review discusses emerging biomarkers associated with the biology of aging and their application in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Aging is the primary risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease and is associated with biological processes implicated in disease development and progression. Novel therapies targeting these underlying biological aging processes are currently undergoing clinical development. Biomarkers that capture the biology of aging are integral to accelerating the development of these therapies. Current progress in biomarker development demonstrates efforts to capture the full spectrum of aging biology. Further work is needed to expand the range of biomarkers that enable comprehensive assessment of brain pathology and aid in prognosis, diagnosis, and measuring treatment response. Establishing a comprehensive arsenal of biomarkers will support strategic decision making and increase the likelihood of positive clinical trials and drug registration for the next generation of Alzheimer's disease drugs targeting the biology of aging.",

Given the heterogeneous nature of AD and the complex multi-level pathological processes leading to dementia (involving, e.g., shared risk factors, interaction of different pathology mechanisms, and their putative synergistic effects on cognition), targeting a single pathology may not be sufficient to halt or significantly impact disease progression. With exponentially increasing numbers of patients world-wide, in parallel to the unprecedented population ageing, new multimodal therapy approaches targeting several modifiable risk factors and disease mechanisms simultaneously are urgently required.

The dominant theoretical models of Alzheimer's disease propose that the brain passively succumbs to disruptions in proteostasis, neuronal dysfunction, inflammatory and other processes, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and dementia. However, an emerging body of evidence suggests that the adult brain is endowed with endogenous mechanisms of resilience which may enable individuals to remain cognitively intact for years despite underlying pathology. In this brief review, we discuss evidence from basic neuroscience and clinical research which demonstrates the existence of endogenous molecular signaling pathways that can promote resilience to neurodegeneration. The p75 neurotrophin receptor provides one such pathway of resilience due to its role as a fundamental signaling switch which determines neuronal survival or degeneration. We highlight a series of preclinical studies targeting the p75 neurotrophin receptor in mouse models which demonstrate resilience to amyloid. We briefly discuss the design and goals of a recent clinical trial of p75 neurotrophin receptor modulation in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Unique challenges for developing therapeutics and biomarkers which are optimized for targeting and detecting endogenous mechanisms of resilience are also discussed.

In terms of the underlying physiology, there is a great need for understanding and controlling interactions between the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system in an attempt to develop approaches to prevent or delay the disease's progression. Nerve cells have limited motion capability, whereas immune cells can migrate freely via circulation. This difference raises a variety of questions in the context of senile plaque formation and phagocytosis. Broad-scale unbiased genomic studies bring several genetic variants such as sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 3 (CD33), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) or complement receptor type 1 (CR1) into the focus of researchers' attention as potential risk factors for neuroinflammation. In addition, advanced proteomic analyses have been revealing links between these genetic contributors and complex, malfunctioning signaling pathways (including the upregulation of factors like tumor necrosis factor TNF-\u03b1, tumor growth factor TGF-\u03b2 and interleukin IL-1\u03b1) that promote proinflammatory mechanisms via intracellular signaling and trafficking, synaptic function, and cell metabolism/ proliferation. In AD, the brain's microglia and astrocytes, which are normally responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of synaptic transmission and its remodeling by pruning, are the initiators of neuroinflammation and toxic tau and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation. Thus, they drive the CNS into a state of sustained or even self-accelerated deterioration.

This manuscript describes the trial design for Phase IIA Alzheimer Study Using oRal Edaravone (ASURE). ASURE is a randomized, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study aiming to evaluate safety and target engagement following administration of TW001 in early AD patients. Patients should have a biomarker confirmed diagnosis to be included in the trial and will be treated for 90 days. The primary endpoints include safety and effect of TW001 on oxidative stress biomarkers. Exploratory endpoints focus on a panel of AD(-related) fluid-based biomarkers and EEG.

This article outlines the design of the clinical study, no results are included. The ASURE trial design is discussed, with a particular focus on fluid biomarkers, EEG, and CFC as endpoints. By testing multiple measures related to pathology, pharmacodynamics, EEG as proxy for cognition, and cognitive functional scores, it is expected that small changes will be detectable in trials of shorter duration.

Numerous cellular hallmarks of aging contribute to the advancement of the pathologies associated with neurodegenerative disease. Not all cellular hallmarks of aging are independent and several fall into the broader category of cellular rejuvenation, which captures returning cells to a more youthful, improved functional state. Cellular rejuvenation is quickly becoming a hot topic in the development of novel therapeutic modalities for a range of diseases. Therapeutic approaches utilizing cellular rejuvenation technologies are rapidly advancing and will represent the next phase of AD therapeutics. This review focuses on two important processes, epigenetic reprogramming, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) that play a critical role in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential therapeutic approaches (gene therapy, small molecule) towards targeting these mechanisms. In aging and in AD, epigenetic changes on DNA (e.g., hypermethylation on CpG islands) lead to alterations in gene expression. Partial epigenetic reprogramming utilizes transcription factors to remove the epigenetic marks and to rejuvenate cells to a more youthful state. During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, CMA becomes impaired resulting in a buildup of proteins known to be associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. The protein buildups lead to aggregates that preclude proteostasis leading to cell toxicity. Small-molecule CMA activators restore proteostasis and limit toxicity enabling cellular rejuvenation.",

Fibrinogen cleavage by thrombin exposes a cryptic epitope termed P2 which can bind CD11b and CD11c on microglia, macrophages and dendritic cells and trigger an inflammatory response toxic to neurons. Indeed, genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrates a causal role for fibrin in innate immune cell activation and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The P2 inflammatory epitope is spatially and compositionally distinct from the coagulation epitope on fibrin. Mouse monoclonal antibody 5B8, which targets the P2 epitope without interfering with the clotting process, has been shown to reduce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The selectivity and efficacy of this anti-human fibrin-P2 antibody in animal models supports the development of a monoclonal antibody drug targeting fibrin P2 for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. THN391 is a humanized, affinity-matured antibody which has a 100-fold greater affinity for fibrin P2 and improved development properties compared to the parental 5B8 antibody. It is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial.",

        "AbstractText": "The recent FDA-approval for amyloid lowering therapies reflects an unwavering commitment from the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research community to identify treatments for this leading cause of dementia. The clinical benefits achieved by reducing amyloid, though modest, provide evidence that disease modification is possible. Expanding the same tenacity to interventions targeting upstream drivers of AD pathogenesis could significantly impact the disease course. Advanced age is the greatest risk factor for developing AD. Interventions targeting biological aging offer the possibility of disrupting a foundational cause of AD. Senescent cells accumulate with age and contribute to inflammation and age-related diseases like AD. Senolytic drugs that clear senescent cells improve healthy aging, halt AD disease progression in animal models and are undergoing clinical testing. This review explores the biology of aging, the role of senescent cells in AD pathology, and various senotherapeutic approaches such as senolytics, dampening the SASP (senescence associated secretory phenotype), senescence pathway inhibition, vaccines, and prodrugs. We highlight ongoing clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the most advanced senolytic approach, dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q), including an ongoing Phase II senolytic trial supported by the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF). Challenges in the field of senotherapy for AD, including target engagement and biomarker development, are addressed. Ultimately, this research pursuit may lead to an effective treatment for AD and provide the field with another disease-modifying therapy to be used, alone or in combination, with other emerging treatment options.",

The acceptable age range for participation in AD clinical trials is 50 to 90, and this 40-year span incorporates enormous age-related change. Clinical trial participants tend to be younger and healthier than the general population. They are also younger than the general population of AD patients. Drug development from a geroscience perspective would take greater account of effects of aging on clinical trial outcomes. The AD clinical trial pipeline has diversified beyond the canonical targets of amyloid beta protein and tau. Many of these interventions apply to age-related disorders. Anti-inflammatory agents and bioenergetic and metabolic therapies are among the well represented classes in the pipeline and are applicable to AD and non-AD age-related conditions. Drug development strategies can be adjusted to better inform outcomes of trials regarding aged individuals. Inclusion of older individuals in the multiple ascending dose trials of Phase 1, use of geriatric-related clinical outcomes and biomarkers in Phase 2, and extension of these Phase 2 learnings to Phase 3 will result in a more comprehensive understanding of AD therapies and their relationship to aging. Clinical trials can employ a more comprehensive geriatric assessment approach and biomarkers more relevant to aging at baseline and as exploratory outcomes. Greater attention to the role of aging and its influence in AD clinical trials can result in better understanding of the generalizability of clinical trial findings to the older AD population.",

Given the escalating prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease, it is essential to understand nonpharmaceutical interventions that could potentially counteract their development and progression. Emerging research indicates that moderate protein intake may offer protective benefits against dementia. Studies also emphasize the importance of considering not just the quantity, but also the quality and source of dietary protein. The role of essential amino acids in nutrition is gaining attention in the field of cognitive health. Moreover, plasma-free amino acid concentrations, particularly branched-chain amino acids, are being explored as potential biomarkers for cognitive health and Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistic studies suggest that proteins and amino acids help maintain neuronal integrity, reduce inflammation, and support muscle retention, all essential factors for cognitive health. Recent findings emphasize the complex relationship between protein, amino acids, and cognitive health, highlighting the potential of dietary interventions in warding off neurodegenerative diseases. Given the observational nature of these findings, further interventional and longitudinal studies are needed to ascertain causality and elucidate the mechanisms involved.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease cortical tau pathology initiates in the layer II cell clusters of entorhinal cortex, but it is not known why these specific neurons are so vulnerable. Aging macaques exhibit the same qualitative pattern of tau pathology as humans, including initial pathology in layer II entorhinal cortex clusters, and thus can inform etiological factors driving selective vulnerability. Macaque data have already shown that susceptible neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex express a \"signature of flexibility\" near glutamate synapses on spines, where cAMP-PKA magnification of calcium signaling opens nearby potassium and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels to dynamically alter synapse strength. This process is regulated by PDE4A/D, mGluR3, and calbindin, to prevent toxic calcium actions; regulatory actions that are lost with age/inflammation, leading to tau phosphorylation. The current study examined whether a similar \"signature of flexibility\" expresses in layer II entorhinal cortex, investigating the localization of PDE4D, mGluR3, and HCN1 channels. Results showed a similar pattern to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with PDE4D and mGluR3 positioned to regulate internal calcium release near glutamate synapses, and HCN1 channels concentrated on spines. As layer II entorhinal cortex stellate cells do not express calbindin, even when young, they may be particularly vulnerable to magnified calcium actions and ensuing tau pathology.",

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), such as apathy, anxiety, stress, and depression, are highly common throughout the AD continuum. However, there is a dearth of research on how these NPS vary across the AD continuum, especially SMC. There is also disagreement on the effects of specific NPS on each stage of the AD continuum due to their collinearity with other NPS, cognitive decline, and environmental factors (e.g., stress). In this article, we conduct a novel perspective review of the scientific literature to understand the presence of NPS across the AD continuum. Specifically, we review the effects of apathy, depression, anxiety, and stress in AD, MCI, and SMC. We then build on this knowledge by proposing two theories of NPS' occurrence across the AD continuum. Consequently, we highlight the current landscape, limitations (e.g., differing operationalization), and contentions surrounding the NPS literature. We also outline theories that could clear up contention and inspire future NPS research.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurological disorder, affecting more than 50 million individuals worldwide and causing gradual but progressive cognitive decline. The rising cost of medical treatment is mostly attributable to AD. There are now mainly a few slightly symptomatic therapeutic options accessible. Although this is not the primary reason, the failure to develop effective treatments for AD is often attributed to the disease's complicated pathophysiology and the wide range of underlying ideas. Studies undertaken over the past decade have aimed to find novel methods of overcoming these barriers and effectively delivering drugs to the central nervous system. As a result, nanotechnology provides a promising alternative to the standard means of administering anti-amyloidosis drugs, enhancing expectations for a successful treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These therapeutic implications of using nanoparticle-based approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are discussed in this paper. Published articles from PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.org, and the Alzheimer Association reports were carefully examined to compile information on the various strategies for combating AD. That has been studied to summarize the recent advancements and clinical studies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Statistics is the study and manipulation of data, including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. The biology of the BBB and its processes of penetration must be carefully taken into account while creating DDSs. If we have a better grasp of the disease's mechanism, we might be able to overcome the shortcomings of current treatments for AD. Different DDSs show interesting properties for delivering medication tailored to the brain. This review paper examines the recent applications of DDSs in diverse domains. By selecting the best targeting vectors and optimizing the combination of carriers, multifunctionalized DDS may be produced, and these DDS have a significant impact on AD therapy potential. To develop DDSs with the best therapeutic efficacy and manageable side effects, experts from a variety of fields may need to contribute their efforts. Currently, the therapeutic use of nanotechnology-based DDSs appears to be a promising prospect for AD therapy, and as the pathophysiology of AD is better understood, this strategy will develop over time.",

There is of great significance for biomarkers in AD diagnosis and management. It emphasizes the limitations of existing diagnostic approaches and the need for reliable and accessible biomarkers. Proteomics, a field that comprehensively analyzes the entire protein complement of cells, tissues, or bio fluids, is presented as a powerful tool for identifying AD biomarkers. There is a diverse range of proteomic approaches employed in AD research, including mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and protein microarrays. The challenges associated with identifying reliable biomarkers, such as sample heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of the disease. There are well-known proteins implicated in AD pathogenesis, such as amyloid-beta peptides, tau protein, Apo lipoprotein E, and clusterin, as well as inflammatory markers and complement proteins. Validation and clinical utility of proteome-based biomarkers are addressing the challenges involved in validation studies and the diagnostic accuracy of these biomarkers. There is great potential in monitoring disease progression and response to treatment, thereby aiding in personalized medicine approaches for AD patients. There is a great role for bioinformatics and data analysis in proteomics for AD biomarker research and the importance of data preprocessing, statistical analysis, pathway analysis, and integration of multi-omics data for a comprehensive understanding of AD pathophysiology. In conclusion, proteome-based biomarkers hold great promise in the field of AD research.

We enrolled all participants from three university hospitals in Korea. We obtained T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and compared the gray matter texture and volume of regions of interest (ROIs) between the groups using analysis of variance with Bonferroni posthoc comparisons. We also developed models for classifying svPPA, AD and control groups using logistic regression analyses, and validated the models using receiver operator characteristics analysis. Compared to the AD group, the svPPA group showed lower volumes in five ROIs (bilateral temporal poles, and the left inferior, middle, and superior temporal cortices) and higher texture in these five ROIs and two additional ROIs (right inferior temporal and left entorhinal cortices). The performances of both texture- and volume-based models were good and comparable in classifying svPPA from normal cognition (mean area under the curve [AUC] = 0.914 for texture; mean AUC = 0.894 for volume). However, only the texture-based model achieved a good level of performance in classifying svPPA and AD (mean AUC = 0.775 for texture; mean AUC = 0.658 for volume).

However, the specific contributions to different domains of cognitive function in late life remain less understood. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which PoB contribute to a wide range of later-life cognitive outcomes. A nationally representative sample of Americans aged 65 and older (N=3,216) from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) was utilized. Cognitive outcomes were assessed in HCAP and linked to HRS state-level PoB data to explore the contribution of birthplace to later-life cognitive disparities. Regression-based Shapley decompositions were employed to quantify this contribution. PoB significantly contributed to all assessed cognitive outcomes including memory, executive function, language and fluency, visuospatial function, orientation, global cognitive performance, cognitive impairment and dementia. Geographic disparities in cognitive outcomes were evident, with individuals born in US southern states and foreign-born individuals performing worse than those born in other states. PoB overall accounted for 2.4-13.9% of the total variance in cognition after adjusting for age and sex. This contribution reduced by half when adjusting for a rich set of sociodemographic and health factors over the life course, but PoB still independently explained 2.0-7.1% of the total variance in cognition. PoB has lasting contributions to later-life cognitive health, with significant geographic disparities observed.

The prospective cohort study used data from 450,027 UK Biobank participants with snoring measured at baseline (2006 - 2010), and followed up for dementia diagnosis (censored at 2022). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis used summary statistics for genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 94,437; cases = 35,274) and snoring (n = 408,317; snorers = 151,011).

Snoring was associated with an 8% lower risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88 to 0.97) and AD (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99). The association was stronger in older individuals, APOE \u03b54 allele carriers, and during shorter follow-up periods. MR analyses suggested no causal effect of snoring on AD, however, genetic liability to AD was associated with a lower risk of snoring. Multivariable MR indicated that the effect of AD on snoring was primarily driven by BMI. The phenotypic association between snoring and lower dementia risk likely stems from reverse causation, with genetic predisposition to AD associated with reduced snoring.

The behavioral differences observed in Wdr23KO animals accompany the stabilization of the NRF2/NFE2L2 protein, an increase in RNA transcripts regulated by this cytoprotective transcription factor, and an increase in the steady state level of antioxidant defense proteins. Taken together, these findings reveal a role for WDR23-proteostasis in mediating cytoprotective capacity in the hippocampus and reveal the potential for targeting WDR23-NRF2 signaling interactions for development of therapies for neurodegenerative disorders.

We found that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in prevalence in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. We further found that neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) contained rG4s, that rG4 structure can drive tau aggregation, and that rG4 formation depended on APOE genotype in the human tissue examined. Combined with previous studies showing the dependence of rG4 structure on stress and the extreme power of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation drives proteostasis collapse.

        "AbstractText": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have achieved remarkable success in associating thousands of genetic variants with complex traits. However, the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) makes it challenging to identify the causal variants. To address this critical gap from association to causation, many fine mapping methods have been proposed to assign well-calibrated probabilities of causality to candidate variants, taking into account the underlying LD pattern. In this manuscript, we introduce a statistical framework that incorporates expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) information to fine mapping, built on the sum of single-effects (SuSiE) regression model. Our new method, SuSiE2, connects two SuSiE models, one for eQTL analysis and one for genetic fine mapping. This is achieved by first computing the posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) from an eQTL-based SuSiE model with the expression level of the candidate gene as the phenotype. These calculated PIPs are then utilized as prior inclusion probabilities for risk variants in another SuSiE model for the trait of interest. By leveraging eQTL information, SuSiE2 enhances the power of detecting causal SNPs while reducing false positives and the average size of credible sets by prioritizing functional variants within the candidate region. The advantages of SuSiE2 over SuSiE are demonstrated by simulations and an application to a single-cell epigenomic study for Alzheimer's disease. We also demonstrate that eQTL information can be used by SuSiE2 to compensate for the power loss because of an inaccurate LD matrix.",

The role for RyR2 in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory is well established and chronic hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 (RyR2P) is associated with pathological calcium leakage and cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. By comparison, little is known about the role of RyR2 in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) circuitry important for working memory, decision making, and reward seeking. Here, we evaluated the basal expression and localization of RyR2 and RyR2P in the vmPFC. Next, we employed an operant model of sucrose, cocaine, or morphine self-administration (SA) followed by a (reward-free) recall test, to reengage vmPFC neurons and reactivate reward-seeking and re-evaluated the expression and localization of RyR2 and RyR2P in vmPFC. Under basal conditions, RyR2 was expressed in pyramidal cells but not regularly detected in PV/SST interneurons. On the contrary, RyR2P was rarely observed in PFC somata and was restricted to a different subcompartment of the same neuron - the apical dendrites of layer-5 pyramidal cells. Chronic SA of drug (cocaine or morphine) and nondrug (sucrose) rewards produced comparable increases in RyR2 protein expression. However, recalling either drug reward impaired the usual localization of RyR2P in dendrites and markedly increased its expression in somata immunoreactive for Fos, a marker of highly activated neurons. These effects could not be explained by chronic stress or drug withdrawal and instead appeared to require a recall experience associated with prior drug SA. In addition to showing the differential distribution of RyR2/RyR2P and affirming the general role of vmPFC in reward learning, this study provides information on the propensity of addictive drugs to redistribute RyR2P ion channels in a neuronal population engaged in drug-seeking. Hence, focusing on the early impact of addictive drugs on RyR2 function may serve as a promising approach to finding a treatment for substance use disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder with varied patient progression. We aim to test the hypothesis that AD patients can be categorized into subgroups based on differences in progression. We leveraged data from three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to develop a knowledge-guided, deep temporal clustering (KG-DTC) framework for AD subtyping. This model combined autoencoders for contextual information capture, k-means clustering for representation formation, and clinical outcome classification for clinical knowledge integration. The derived representations, encompassing demographics, APOE genotype, cognitive assessments, brain volumes, and biomarkers, were clustered using the Gaussian Mixture Model to identify AD subtypes. Our novel KG-DTC framework was developed using placebo data from 2,087 AD patients across three solanezumab clinical trials (EXPEDITION, EXPEDITION2, and EXPEDITION3), achieving high performance in outcome prediction and clustering. The KG-DTC model demonstrated superior clustering structures, especially when combined with k-means clustering loss. External validation with independent clinical trial data showed consistent clustering results, with a 0.33 silhouette score for three clusters. The model's stability was confirmed through a leave-one-out approach, with an average adjusted Rand Index around 0.945. Three distinct AD subtypes were identified, each exhibiting unique patterns of cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and amyloid beta levels. Notably, Subtype 3 (S3) showed rapid cognitive decline across multiple clinical measures (e.g., 0.64 in S1 vs. -1.06 in S2 vs. 15.09 in S3 of average ADAS total change score, p<.001). This innovative approach offers promising insights for understanding variability in treatment outcomes and personalizing AD treatment strategies.",

        "AbstractText": "ApoE4 is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease. While apoE is primarily expressed by astrocytes, AD pathology including endosomal abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction first occurs in neurons. Lysosomes are poised at the convergence point between these features. We find that apoE4-expressing cells exhibit lysosomal alkalinization, reduced lysosomal proteolysis, and impaired mitophagy. To identify driving factors for this lysosomal dysfunction, we performed quantitative lysosomal proteome profiling. This revealed that apoE4 expression results in lysosomal depletion of Lgals3bp and accumulation of Tmed5 in both Neuro-2a cells and postmitotic human neurons. Modulating the expression of both proteins affected lysosomal function, with Tmed5 knockdown rescuing lysosomal alkalinization in apoE4 cells, and Lgals3bp knockdown causing lysosomal alkalinization and reduced lysosomal density in apoE3 cells. Taken together, our work reveals that apoE4 exerts gain-of-toxicity by alkalinizing the lysosomal lumen, pinpointing lysosomal Tmed5 accumulation and Lgals3bp depletion as apoE4-associated drivers for this phenotype.",

        "AbstractText": "The actin cytoskeleton is a biosensor of cellular stress and a potential prognosticator of human disease. In particular, aberrant cytoskeletal structures such as cofilin-actin rods and stress granules formed in response to energetic and oxidative stress are closely linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS. Whether these cytoskeletal phenomena can be harnessed for the development of biosensors for cytoskeletal dysfunction and, by extension, neurodegenerative disease progression, remains an open question. In this work, we describe the design and development of an optogenetic iteration of profilin, an actin monomer binding protein with critical functions in cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that this optically activated profilin ('OptoProfilin') can act as an optically triggered biosensor of applied cellular stress in select immortalized cell lines. Notably, OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor, likely increasing its utility for experimentalists. While a large body of work closely links profilin activity with cellular stress and neurodegenerative disease, this, to our knowledge, is the first example of profilin as an optogenetic biosensor of stress-induced changes in the cytoskeleton.",

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world after Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosing PD is challenging as it evolved slowly, and its symptoms eventuate gradually. Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in speech may be utilized as an excellent biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD. In this study, we have proposed a Chirplet transform (CT) based novel approach for diagnosing PD using speech signals. We employed CT to get the time-frequency matrix (TFM) of each speech recording, and we extracted time-frequency based entropy (TFE) features from the TFM. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the TFE features reflect the changes in speech that occurs in the speech due to PD, hence can be used for classifying the PD and healthy control (HC) individuals. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using the vowels and words from the PC-GITA database. The genetic algorithm is utilized to select the optimum features subset, while a support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) classifiers are employed for classification. The TFE features outperform the breathiness and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features. The SVM classifier is most effective compared to other machine-learning classifiers. The highest classification accuracy rates of 98% and 99% are achieved using the vowel /a/ and word /atleta/, respectively. The results reveal that the proposed CT-based entropy features effectively diagnose PD using the speech of a person.",

        "AbstractText": "Frontal, temporal lobe dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have found that CCNF mutations have been found in patients with familial and sporadic ALS and FTD. Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by progressive deterioration of personality, social behaviour, and cognitive function, which is most closely related to genetic factors. As the early symptoms of bvFTD are highly heterogeneous, the condition is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease or psychiatric disorders. In this study, a bvFTD patient had a CCNF gene mutation, which led to ubiquitinated protein accumulation and ultimately caused neurodegenerative disease. Genetic detection should be improved urgently for bvFTD patients and family members to provide a clinical reference for early diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. In this case, the patient was 65 years old with an insidious onset, early-onset memory loss, a significant decline in the episodic memory, an early AD diagnosis, and oral treatment with donepezil hydrochloride for 3 years with poor efficacy, followed by a change to oral memantine hydrochloride tablets, which controlled the condition for several months. His medication was switched to sodium oligomannate capsules, and his condition was gradually controlled, but no significant improvement was observed. After spontaneous drug withdrawal, the patient's condition progressed rapidly; therefore, he visited our hospital and underwent neuropsychological tests for moderate to severe cognitive impairment. AD cerebrospinal fluid markers showed no significant abnormalities, and cranial MRI revealed frontotemporal lobe atrophy and decreased hippocampal volume. Genetic testing for the presence of the CCNF gene revealed a c.1532C > A (p. T511N) heterozygous variant, which might be a diagnostic criterion for bvFTD. Therefore, the patient's symptoms recurred after transient improvement with the combination of donepezil, oral memantine hydrochloride tablets, and sodium oligomannate, but his overall condition was improved compared to that before, and this treatment regimen was continued to observe changes during the follow-up. The early clinical manifestations of bvFTD are complex and variable, and the condition is easily misdiagnosed, thus delaying treatment. Therefore, for patients with a high clinical suspicion of FTD, in addition to a detailed understanding of their medical history and family history and improvement of relevant examinations, genetic testing should be performed as early as possible to help confirm the diagnosis. For diseases closely related to genes, genetic testing of other family members should be optimised as much as possible to allow early diagnosis and intervention and guide fertility in the next generation.",

        "AbstractText": "Chronic exposure to stress throughout the lifespan has been the focus of many studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of the similarities between the biological mechanisms involved in chronic stress and the pathophysiology of AD. In fact, the earliest abnormality associated with the disease is the presence of phosphorylated tau protein in locus coeruleus neurons, a brain structure highly responsive to stress and perceived threat. Here, we introduce allostatic load as a useful concept for understanding many of the complex, interacting neuropathological changes involved in the AD degenerative process. In response to chronic stress, aberrant tau proteins that begin to accumulate within the locus coeruleus decades prior to symptom onset appear to represent a primary pathological event in the AD cascade, triggering a wide range of interacting brain changes involving neuronal excitotoxicity, endocrine alterations, inflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid plaque exacerbation. While it is acknowledged that stress will not necessarily be the major precipitating factor in all cases, early tau-induced changes within the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine pathway suggests that a therapeutic window might exist for preventative measures aimed at managing stress and restoring balance within the HPA axis.",

        "AbstractText": "With the first complete draft of a human genome, the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium unlocked previously concealed genomic regions for genetic analyses. These regions harbour nearly 2000 potential novel genes with unknown function. In order to uncover candidate genes associated with human neurological pathologies, a comparative transcriptome study using the T2T-CHM13 and the GRCh38 genome assemblies was conducted on previously published datasets for eight distinct human neurological disorders. The analysis of differential expression in RNA sequencing data led to the identification of 336 novel candidate genes linked to human neurological disorders. Additionally, it was revealed that, on average, 3.6% of the differentially expressed genes detected with the GRCh38 assembly may represent potential false positives. Among the noteworthy findings, two novel genes were discovered, one encoding a pore-structured protein and the other a highly ordered \u03b2-strand-rich protein. These genes exhibited upregulation in multiple epilepsy datasets and hold promise as candidate genes potentially modulating the progression of the disease. Furthermore, an analysis of RNA derived from white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis patients indicated significant upregulation of 26 rRNA encoding genes. Additionally, putative pathology related genes were identified for Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glioblastoma, glioma, and conditions resulting from the m.3242 A\u2009>\u2009G mtDNA mutation. The results presented here underline the potential of the T2T-CHM13 assembly in facilitating the discovery of candidate genes from transcriptome data in the context of human disorders. Moreover, the results demonstrate the value of remapping sequencing data to a superior genome assembly. Numerous potential pathology related genes, either as causative factors or related elements, have been unveiled, warranting further experimental validation.",

However, screening eligible patients for multidomain intervention by PET is difficult to generalize in real-world settings. MAPT study was a 3-year, randomized, placebo-controlled trial followed by a 2-year observational and optional extension. All participants were non-demented and randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to the MI plus omega 3, MI plus placebo, omega 3 alone, or placebo alone group. The objectives were to assess the cognitive effect of MAPT interventions (omega 3 supplementation, MI, combined intervention) in non-demented subjects according to amyloid blood status at 12, 36, and 60\u00a0months. In this subgroup analysis (n\u2009=\u2009483), amyloid status was defined by plasma A\u03b242/40 ratio (cutoff \u2264\u00a00.0107). The primary outcome measure was the change in cognitive composite score after a 1, 3, and 5-year clinical follow-up. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included 483 subjects (161 positive and 322 negative amyloid participants based on plasma A\u03b242/40 ratio). In the positive amyloid ITT population, we showed a positive effect of MI plus omega 3 on the change in composite cognitive score in 12 (raw p\u2009=\u2009.0350, 0.01917, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009[0.0136 to 0.3699]) and 36 months (raw p\u2009=\u2009.0357, 0.2818, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009[0.0190 to 0.5446]). After correction of multiple comparisons and adjustments, these differences were not significant (adjusted p\u2009=\u2009.1144 and .0690). In the per-protocol positive amyloid group (n\u2009=\u2009154), we observed a significant difference between the combined intervention and placebo groups at 12 (p\u2009=\u2009.0313, 0.2424, 0.0571 to 0.4276) and 36 months (p\u2009=\u2009.0195, 0.3747, 0.1055 to 0.6439) persisting after adjustment. In the ITT and per-protocol analyses, no cognitive effect was observed in the positive and negative amyloid group at 60-month visit. These findings suggest a benefit of MI plus omega 3 in positive blood amyloid subjects. This promising trend needs to be confirmed before using blood biomarkers for screening in preventive trials.

We explored the effect of rTMS-induced network reorganization and its predictive value for individual treatment response. Sixty-two amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD patients were recruited. These subjects were assigned to multimodal magnetic resonance imaging scanning before and after a 4-week stimulation. Then, we investigated the neural mechanism underlying rTMS treatment based on static functional network connectivity (sFNC) and dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analyses. Finally, the support vector regression was used to predict the individual rTMS treatment response through these functional features at baseline. We found that rTMS at the left angular gyrus significantly induced cognitive improvement in multiple cognitive domains. Participants after rTMS treatment exhibited significantly the increased sFNC between the right frontoparietal network (rFPN) and left frontoparietal network (lFPN) and decreased sFNC between posterior visual network and medial visual network. We revealed remarkable dFNC characteristics of brain connectivity, which was increased mainly in higher-order cognitive networks and decreased in primary networks or between primary networks and higher-order cognitive networks. dFNC characteristics in state 1 and state 4 could further predict individual higher memory improvement after rTMS treatment (state 1, R\u2009=\u20090.58; state 4, R\u2009=\u20090.54). Our findings highlight that neuro-navigated rTMS could suppress primary network connections to compensate for higher-order cognitive networks.

Dynamic reorganization of brain networks could predict the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease. \u2022 rTMS at the left angular gyrus could induce cognitive improvement. \u2022 rTMS could suppress primary network connections to compensate for higher-order networks. \u2022 Dynamic reorganization of brain networks could predict individual treatment response to rTMS.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia and is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration leading to severe cognitive, memory, and behavioral impairments. The onset of AD involves a complex interplay among various factors, including age, genetics, chronic inflammation, and impaired energy metabolism. Despite significant efforts, there are currently no effective therapies capable of modifying the course of AD, likely owing to an excessive focus on the amyloid hypothesis and a limited consideration of other intracellular pathways. In the present review, we emphasize the emerging concept of AD as a metabolic disease, where alterations in energy metabolism play a critical role in its development and progression. Notably, glucose metabolism impairment is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and protein misfolding, forming interconnected processes that perpetuate a detrimental self-feeding loop sustaining AD progression. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), neurotoxic compounds that accumulate in AD, are considered an important consequence of glucose metabolism disruption, and glyceraldehyde (GA), a glycolytic intermediate, is a key contributor to AGEs formation in both neurons and astrocytes. Exploring the impact of GA-induced glucose metabolism impairment opens up exciting possibilities for creating an easy-to-handle in vitro model that recapitulates the early stage of the disease. This model holds great potential for advancing the development of novel therapeutics targeting various intracellular pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. In conclusion, looking beyond the conventional amyloid hypothesis could lead researchers to discover promising targets for intervention, offering the possibility of addressing the existing medical gaps in AD treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) subsists in all living organisms and has drawn tremendous attention as a nutraceutical and pharmaceutical product for several diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, aging, and vascular dysfunction. Here, NMN was produced intracellularly in a high cell density bioreactor using an engineered Escherichiacoli strain via exponential feeding of co-substrates. Fed-batch culture via exponential feeding of co-substrate (glucose) and continuous feeding of substrate (nicotinamide) were performed using different cumulative nicotinamide concentrations. The highest concentration of 19.3\u00a0g/L NMN with a dry cell weight of 117\u00a0g/L was acquired from a cumulative nicotinamide concentration of 7.2\u00a0g/L with a conversion of 98\u00a0% from nicotinamide in 28\u00a0h. Further, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis validated the NMN production. This approach will be beneficial in achieving simultaneously low cost and ensuring high quality and quantity of NMN production.",

        "AbstractText": "Information processed in our sensory neocortical areas is transported to the hippocampus during memory encoding, and between hippocampus and neocortex during memory consolidation, and retrieval. Short bursts of high-frequency oscillations, so called sharp-wave-ripples, have been proposed as a potential mechanism for this information transfer: They can synchronize neural activity to support the formation of local neural networks to store information, and between distant cortical sites to act as a bridge to transfer information between sensory cortical areas and hippocampus. In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease, different neuropathological processes impair normal neural functioning and neural synchronization as well as sharp-wave-ripples, which impairs consolidation and retrieval of information, and compromises memory. Here, we formulate a new hypothesis, that artificially inducing sharp-wave-ripples with noninvasive high-frequency visual stimulation could potentially support memory functioning, as well as target the neuropathological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases. We also outline key challenges for empirical tests of the hypothesis.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurological disorders and, researchers believe that the impairment of oxidant-antioxidant system plays an important role in its progression. The PI3K/NRF2 pathway has particular importance in increasing the expression of antioxidants. Thus present study aimed to investigate the effect of eight weeks of aerobic training (AT) with vitamin C (VC) on the expression pathway of antioxidants in the hippocampus tissue of trimethyltin chloride (TMT) induced Alzheimer's Disease Rats. In this experimental study, 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats (age 14-16\u00a0months, weight 270-320\u00a0g) were injected 10\u00a0mg/kg TMT and were divided into (1) TMT (n\u00a0=\u00a07), (2) TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC (n\u00a0=\u00a07), (3) TMT\u00a0+\u00a0AT (n\u00a0=\u00a07) and (4) TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT (n\u00a0=\u00a07) groups. Also, 7 healthy rats without any intervention selected as healthy control (HC) group to investigate the effects of TMT on research variables. Groups 3 and 4 ran on the treadmill for eight weeks, for 15-48\u00a0min at a speed of 10-24\u00a0m/min. Also, groups 2 and 4 received 4\u00a0mg/kg VC orally. To measure PI3K, Nrf2, SOD and catalase in the hippocampus tissue of rats, ELISA method were used. To analyze the data, one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post- hoc tests were used (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The hippocampal values of Nrf2 and SOD in TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC, TMT\u00a0+\u00a0AT and TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT groups were higher than TMT group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Catalase in TMT\u00a0+\u00a0AT and TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT groups was higher than TMT group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Also, catalase and PI3K were higher in the TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT group than the TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). PI3K levels of TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT group were higher than TMT\u00a0+\u00a0AT group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). It seems that AT and VC, both alone and in combination, play a role in improving the transcription pathway of antioxidants in the hippocampus tissue of TMT induced Alzheimer's disease Rats. Therefore, the combination of these two interventions is suggested to improve the antioxidant system.",

In this study, we examined the in vitro anti-amyloidogenic activity of the isoindolinone derivative 3-(3-oxoisoindolin-1-yl)pentane-2,4-dione (ISOAC1) and its neuroprotective potential against the A\u03b21-42 toxicity. By performing the Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, Western blotting analyses, and Circular Dichroism experiments, we found that ISOAC1 was able to reduce the A\u03b21-42 aggregation and conformational transition towards \u03b2-sheet structures. Interestingly, in silico studies revealed that ISOAC1 was able to bind to both the monomer and a pentameric protofibril of A\u03b21-42, establishing a hydrophobic interaction with the PHE19 residue of the A\u03b21-42 KLVFF motif. In vitro analyses on primary cortical neurons showed that ISOAC1 counteracted the increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels and decreased the A\u03b21-42-induced toxicity, in terms of mitochondrial activity reduction and increase of reactive oxygen species production. In addition, confocal microscopy analyses showed that ISOAC1 was able to reduce the A\u03b21-42 intraneuronal accumulation. Collectively, our results clearly show that ISOAC1 exerts a neuroprotective effect by reducing the A\u03b21-42 aggregation and toxicity, hence emerging as a promising compound for the development of new A\u03b2-targeting therapeutic strategies for AD treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) share common features, including insulin resistance. Brain insulin resistance has been implicated as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-diabetic drugs sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2-i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4-i) improve insulin sensitivity and provide neuroprotection. However, the effects of these two inhibitors on the brain metabolism and insulin resistance remain uninvestigated. We developed a T2D-AD mouse model using a high-fat diet (HFD) for 19 weeks along with a single dose of streptozotocin (100\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at the fourth week of HFD initiation. Subsequently, the animals were treated with SGLT2-i (empagliflozin, 25\u00a0mg/kg/day orally [p.o.]) and DPP4-i (sitagliptin, 100\u00a0mg/kg/day p.o.) for 7 weeks. Subsequently, behavioral tests were performed, and the expression of insulin signaling, AD-related, and other signaling pathway proteins in the brain were examined. T2D-AD mice not only showed increased blood glucose levels and body weight but also insulin resistance. SGLT2-i and DPP4-i effectively ameliorated insulin sensitivity and reduced body weight in these mice. Furthermore, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i significantly improved hippocampal-dependent learning, memory, and cognitive functions in the T2D-AD mouse model. Interestingly, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i reduced the hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) levels and amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation and enhanced brain insulin signaling. SGLT2-i reduced pTau accumulation through the angiotensin converting enzyme-2/angiotensin (1-7)/ mitochondrial assembly receptor axis, whereas DPP4-i reduced A\u03b2 accumulation by increasing insulin-degrading enzyme levels. These findings suggest that SGLT2-i and DPP4-i prevent AD-like pathology and cognitive dysfunction in T2D mice potentially through affecting brain insulin signaling via different mechanisms.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a fatal, incurable, chronic neurodegenerative disease. Diagnosis in its early and even preclinical stages will be beneficial for its prevention and treatment. In the accepted pathological theory, abnormal accumulation of A\u03b2 protein and abnormal mitochondrial function, including changes in mitochondrial viscosity, is closely related to Alzheimer's disease. To date, rare fluorescent probes have been reported that can simultaneously image A\u03b2 plaques and mitochondrial viscosity. Therefore, the development of a dual-functional fluorescent probe for real-time fluorescence imaging of A\u03b2 plaques and mitochondrial viscosity is crucial to discover a novel approach and strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and to understand the pathological process and crosstalk between different biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of fluorescent probes QM-SF-1\u223c5 with dimethylamino-quinolinium as the skeleton and thiophene as the \u03c0 bridge to connect the groups with different electron-push/pull capacities. Among them, QM-SF-2 exhibited excellent properties such as large Stokes shift (168\u00a0nm), near-infrared emission (689\u00a0nm), and high selectivity and sensitivity (limit of detection was 1.07\u00a0\u03bcM) to A\u03b2 aggregate and mitochondrial viscosity changes, indicating its promising prospects as a dual-functional imaging tool in the pathological study of Alzheimer's disease.",

Dementia friendly communities have been shown to reduce stigma, and the gap in health and social outcomes for people impacted by dementia. Despite the large presence of established dementia friendly communities, their functioning in multicultural communities remains underexplored. The aim of this review was to identify the barriers and facilitators of cultural inclusivity to inform the development of a multicultural dementia friendly community. We systematically searched for academic and grey literature regarding existing and prospective age or dementia-friendly communities that engaged with culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Using the matrix method, data on the barriers and facilitators to engagement were extracted. Papers were analysed for common themes and findings were integrated in a narrative format. A total of 3,164 papers were identified, 11 of which met inclusion criteria. There were 6 dementia friendly communities in North America, 3 in Europe, 1 in Australia and 1 in Asia. Analyses revealed that barriers to cultural inclusivity were centered around the accessibility of services, sociocultural factors, and the environment, including issues such as low awareness of dementia and stigma, language barriers, isolation, and the inaccessibility of transport and buildings. Leveraging existing cultural leaders and social structures to target culturally and linguistically diverse populations and develop tailored dementia friendly initiatives were key facilitators. To foster cultural inclusivity in dementia friendly communities, a culturally specific lens that addresses these barriers and utilises facilitators must be applied from the design stage through to implementation and evaluation.",

We addressed the question whether a deficit in episodic thinking can be picked up directly from connected speech and its detection can be automatized. We linguistically classified 2,809 utterances (including embedded clauses in the utterances) from picture descriptions from 70 healthy older controls, 82 people with mild probable AD (pAD), and 46 people with moderate pAD for whether they were episodic, nonepisodic, or \"other\" (e.g., off-task). Generalized linear regression models were used to investigate how ratios of these categories change in AD, controlling for age, gender, and education. Finally, we applied deep learning technique to explore the feasibility of automating the episodicity analysis. Decline in episodicity significantly distinguished controls from both mild pAD and moderate pAD. Correlation analysis suggested this decline not to be an effect of age, gender, and education but of cognitive ability. The decline was not compensated by an increase of nonepisodic utterances but mainly of off-task expressions. A transformer-based classifier to explore the possibility of automatizing the classification of episodicity achieved a macro F1 score of 0.913 in the ternary classification. These results show that a loss of episodicity is an early effect in AD that is manifested in spontaneous speech and can be reliably measured by both humans and machines.",

This cohort study performed a longitudinal time-varying analysis of electronic health records for patients receiving primary care in the Johns Hopkins Community Physicians Network between January 1, 2014, and May 6, 2023. Patients 65 years and older with at least 2 visits 30 days apart to their primary care physicians were eligible.

The exposure variable was a low TSH level, characterized based on the clinical context as due to endogenous thyrotoxicosis, exogenous thyrotoxicosis, or unknown cause, excluding those attributable to acute illness or other medical factors such as medications. The outcome measure was cognitive disorders, including mild cognitive impairment and all-cause dementia, to improve sensitivity and account for the underdiagnosis of dementia in primary care.

Nonetheless, evidence regarding the correlation between aspirin consumption and the onset of dementia and AD is limited. This review aims to provide an up-to-date summary of the existing evidence and evaluate the association between aspirin and the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Additionally, we conducted subgroup analyses to evaluate the overall effect of low-dose (75-100\u00a0mg) aspirin consumption on the onset of dementia and AD. A total of 875 studies were identified, with only 22 meeting the inclusion criteria. There was no statistically significant impact of aspirin consumption on the onset of dementia (HR 1.13, 11 studies) or Alzheimer's disease (HR 0.91, 3 studies). Additionally, subgroup analysis showed that taking low doses of aspirin (75-100\u00a0mg) did not significantly affect the onset of either dementia (HR 0.96, 13 studies) or Alzheimer's disease (HR 0.85, 2 studies). Aspirin use does not decrease the risk of dementia or AD, even when taken in low doses.

Moreover, microRNA scaffolds and corresponding drug scaffolds of different pathways were also discovered. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to identify pathway-specific significant miRNAs. We generated feed-forward loop regulations of microRNA-TF-gene-based networks, studied the minimum free energy structures of pre-microRNA sequences, and clustered those microRNAs with their corresponding structural motifs of robust transcription factors. Conservation analyses of significant microRNAs were done, and the phylogenetic trees were constructed. We identified 3'UTR binding sites and chromosome locations of these significant microRNAs. In this study, hsa-miR-4261, hsa-miR-153-5p, hsa-miR-6766, and hsa-miR-4319 were identified as key miRNAs for the ACHE pathway and hsa-miR-326, hsa-miR-6133, hsa-miR-4251, hsa-miR-3148, hsa-miR-10527-5p, hsa-miR-527, and hsa-miR-518a were identified as regulatory miRNAs for the NMDA pathway. These miRNAs were regulated by several AD-specific TFs, namely RAD21, FOXA1, and ESR1. It has been observed that anisole and adamantane are important chemical scaffolds to regulate these significant miRNAs. This is the first study that developed a detailed correlation between known AD drug scaffolds and their AD target-specific miRNA scaffolds. This study identified chromosomal locations of microRNAs and corresponding structural scaffolds of transcription factors that may be responsible for miRNA co-regulation for Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides hope for therapeutic improvements in the existing microRNAs by regulating pathways and targets.",

Thirteen \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-arylalkanoic acids were previously synthesized and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity. The aim of this study was to asses ex vivo antioxidant activity of synthesized acids, as well as ibuprofen and to identify the compounds with the most promising results for further investigation on their capacity to counteract in vivo oxidative stress triggered by inflammation. The antioxidant potential of tested compounds was evaluated by determining the concentrations of total antioxidative status, total oxidative status, prooxidant antioxidant balance and the total sulfhydryl groups. Z score statistics were used to calculate the summary scores for antioxidative activity, prooxidative activity and oxy score. The tested compounds and ibuprofen demonstrated mild prooxidative activity ex vivo. Seven acids with substituents on one benzene ring exhibited better results than ibuprofen and were selected for in vivo testing. In vivo results demonstrated better antioxidant protection compared to ex vivo results. Compound g which contains nitro group on the benzene ring demonstrated the lowest oxy score, and four compounds exhibited better results than ibuprofen.",

It may also manifest as early symptoms of the neurodegenerative process associated with dementia. The relationship between the magnitude and timing of orthostatic BP responses and dementia risk is not fully understood. We conducted a prospective cohort analysis of the associations of orthostatic BP changes and self-reported orthostatic dizziness with the risk of dementia in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC).

The primary outcome was adjudicated dementia ascertained through 2019. Among 11\u2005644 participants (mean [SD] age, 54.5 [5.7] years; 54.1% women; 25.9% Black), 2303 dementia cases were identified during a median follow-up of 25.9 years. Large decreases in systolic BP from the supine to standing position measured at the first 2 measurements \u224830 and 50 seconds after standing, but not afterward, were associated with orthostatic dizziness and a higher risk of dementia. Comparing a decrease in systolic BP of \u2264-20 or >-20 to -10 mm\u2009Hg to stable systolic BP (>-10 to 10 mm\u2009Hg) at the first measurement, the adjusted hazard ratios were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01-1.47) and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.97-1.25), respectively. Abnormal orthostatic BP regulation, especially abrupt drops in BP within the first minute, might be early risk markers for the development of dementia. Transient early orthostatic hypotension warrants more attention in clinical settings.",

Despite promising efficacy observed in some clinical trials, the full range of biological effects and mechanism(s) of action of these compounds have yet to be fully established. Indeed, most studies to date have focused on assessing the psychological mechanisms of psychedelics, often neglecting the non-psychological modes of action. However, it is important to understand that psychedelics may mediate their therapeutic effects through multi-faceted mechanisms, such as the modulation of brain network activity, neuronal plasticity, neuroendocrine function, glial cell regulation, epigenetic processes, and the gut-brain axis. This review provides a framework supporting the implementation of a multi-faceted approach, incorporating in silico, in vitro and in vivo modeling, to aid in the comprehensive understanding of the physiological effects of psychedelics and their potential for clinical application beyond the treatment of psychiatric disorders. We also provide an overview of the literature supporting the potential utility of psychedelics for the treatment of brain injury (e.g., stroke and traumatic brain injury), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases), and gut-brain axis dysfunction associated with psychiatric disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder).

The anterior cingulate is a focal point of pathology in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Sulcation of the anterior cingulate is denoted by the presence of a paracingulate sulcus, a tertiary sulcus developing, where present during the third gestational trimester and remaining stable throughout life. This study aims to examine the impact of right paracingulate sulcal presence on the expression and prognosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. This retrospective analysis drew its population from two clinical samples recruited from memory clinics at university hospitals in the USA and The Netherlands. Individuals with sporadic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were enrolled between 2000 and 2022 and followed up for an average of 7.71 years. T1-MRI data were evaluated for hemispheric paracingulate sulcal presence in accordance with an established protocol by two blinded raters. Outcome measures included age at onset, survival, cortical thickness and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration-modified Clinical Dementia Rating determined clinical disease progression. The study population consisted of 186 individuals with sporadic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (113 males and 73 females), mean age 63.28 years (SD 8.32). The mean age at onset was 2.44 years later in individuals possessing a right paracingulate sulcus [60.2 years (8.54)] versus individuals who did not [57.76 (8.05)], 95% confidence interval > 0.41, P = 0.02. Education was not associated with age at onset (\u03b2 = -0.05, P = 0.75). The presence of a right paracingulate sulcus was associated with an 83% increased risk of death per year after age at onset (hazard ratio 1.83, confidence interval [1.09-3.07], P < 0.02), whilst the mean age at death was similar for individuals with a present and absent right paracingulate sulcus (P = 0.7). Right paracingulate sulcal presence was not associated with baseline cortical thickness. Right paracingulate sulcal presence is associated with disease expression and survival in sporadic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.

Increasing clinical and preclinical evidence implicates that there is bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), which is also known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Nevertheless, current knowledge on the interplay between gut microbiota and the brain remains largely unclear. One of the primary mediating factors by which the gut microbiota interacts with the host is peripheral metabolites, including blood or gut-derived metabolites. However, mechanistic knowledge about the effect of the microbiome and metabolome signaling on the brain is limited. Neuroimaging techniques, such as multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have the potential to directly elucidate brain structural and functional changes corresponding with alterations of the gut microbiota and peripheral metabolites in vivo. Employing a combination of gut microbiota, metabolome, and advanced neuroimaging techniques provides a future perspective in illustrating the microbiota-gut-brain pathway and further unveiling potential therapeutic targets for AD treatments.",

To examine gaps in falls prevention targeting people with PD as part of the Task Force on Global Guidelines for Falls in Older Adults. A Delphi consensus process was used to identify specific recommendations for falls in PD. The current narrative review was conducted as educational background with a view to identifying gaps in fall prevention. A recent Cochrane review recommended exercises and structured physical activities for PD; however, the types of exercises and activities to recommend and PD subgroups likely to benefit require further consideration. Freezing of gait, reduced gait speed, and a prior history of falls are risk factors for falls in PD and should be incorporated in assessments to identify fall risk and target interventions. Multimodal and multi-domain fall prevention interventions may be beneficial. With advanced or complex PD, balance and strength training should be administered under supervision. Medications, particularly cholinesterase inhibitors, show promise for falls prevention. Identifying how to engage people with PD, their families, and health professionals in falls education and implementation remains a challenge. Barriers to the prevention of falls occur at individual, environmental, policy, and health system levels.

Results showed no effect of the exercise intervention on cognition immediately post-intervention, nor an effect of acute exercise on any sleep variable.

Therefore, every Alzheimer's patient receives the same treatment plan, regardless of the etiology, which may or may not be successful in slowing or preventing the disease's progression.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) are the two main proteins implicated in AD. Indeed, the major available commercial drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) against Alzheimer's are AChE inhibitors. However, none of these drugs are known to reverse or reduce the pathophysiological condition of the disease since there are multiple contributing factors to AD. Therefore, there is a need to develop a multitarget-directed ligand approach for its treatment. In the present study, plant bioactive compounds were screened for their AChE and BACE1 inhibition potential by conducting molecular docking studies.

In this study, an AD risk gene prediction framework based on spatial and temporal features of gene expression data (STGE) was proposed. Methods: We proposed an AD risk gene prediction framework based on spatial and temporal features of gene expression data. The gene expression data of providers of different tissues and ages were used as model features. Human genes were classified as AD risk or non-risk sets based on information extracted from relevant databases. Support vector machine (SVM) models were constructed to capture the expression patterns of genes believed to contribute to the risk of AD. Results: The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was utilized for feature selection. Data for 64 tissue-age features were obtained before feature selection, and this number was reduced to 19 after RFE was performed. The SVM models were built and evaluated using 19 selected and full features. The area under curve (AUC) values for the SVM model based on 19 selected features (0.740 [0.690-0.790]) and full feature sets (0.730 [0.678-0.769]) were very similar. Fifteen genes predicted to be risk genes for AD with a probability greater than 90% were obtained. Conclusion: The newly proposed framework performed comparably to previous prediction methods based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) network properties. A list of 15 candidate genes for AD risk was also generated to provide data support for further studies on the genetic etiology of AD.",

Biomarkers based on routinely acquired clinical MR images, could supplement the extant invasive or logistically challenging) biomarker studies. We used 1104 longitudinal MR, 324 amyloid beta, and 87 tau positron emission tomography imaging sessions from 525 participants enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Observational Study to extract novel imaging metrics representing the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of standardized image intensities of T1-weighted and Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR scans. There was an exponential decrease in FLAIR-\u03bc in mutation carriers and an increase in FLAIR and T1 signal heterogeneity (T1-\u03c3 and FLAIR-\u03c3) as participants approached the symptom onset in both supramarginal, the right postcentral and right superior temporal gyri as well as both caudate nuclei, putamina, thalami, and amygdalae. After controlling for the effect of regional atrophy, FLAIR-\u03bc decreased and T1-\u03c3 and FLAIR-\u03c3 increased with increasing amyloid beta and tau deposition in numerous cortical regions. In symptomatic mutation carriers and independent of the effect of regional atrophy, tau pathology demonstrated a stronger relationship with image intensity metrics, compared with amyloid pathology. We propose novel MR imaging intensity-based metrics using standard clinical T1 and FLAIR images which strongly associates with the progression of pathology in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease. We suggest that tau pathology may be a key driver of the observed changes in this cohort of patients.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Discrepancies in Patient and Caregiver Ratings of Personality Change in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.",
        "AbstractText": "Personality change in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is complicated by the patient and informant factors that confound accurate reporting of personality traits. We assessed the impact of caregiver burden on informant report of Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness) and investigated the regional cortical volumes associated with larger discrepancies in the patient and informant report of the Big Five personality traits. Sixty-four ADRD participants with heterogeneous neurodegenerative clinical phenotypes and their informants completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Caregiver burden was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview. Discrepancy scores were computed as the difference between patient and informant ratings for the BFI. Regional gray matter volumes from T1-weighted 3T MRI were normalized to intracranial volume and related to global Big Five discrepancy scores using linear regression. Higher levels of caregiver burden were associated with higher informant ratings of patient neuroticism (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.08, p =\u00a0.012) and with lower informant ratings of patient agreeableness (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.11, p =\u00a0.021) and conscientiousness (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.04, p =\u00a0.034) independent of disease severity. Patients with greater Big Five discrepancy scores showed smaller cortical volumes in the right medial prefrontal cortex (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-5.24, p =\u00a0.045) and right superior temporal gyrus (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-7.91, p =\u00a0.028). Informant ratings of personality traits in ADRD can be confounded by the caregiver burden, highlighting the need for more objective measures of personality and behavior in dementia samples. Discrepancies between informant and patient ratings of personality may additionally reflect loss of insight secondary to cortical atrophy in the frontal and temporal structures.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the predominant impairment of neurons in the hippocampus and the formation of amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The overexpression of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) in an AD brain results in the binding of APP intracellular domain (AICD) to Fe65 protein via the C-terminal Fe65-PTB2 interaction, which then triggers the secretion of amyloid-\u03b2 and the consequent pathogenesis of AD. Apparently, targeting the interaction between APP and Fe65 can offer a promising therapeutic approach for AD. Recently, exosome, a type of extracellular vesicle with diameter around 30-200\u2009nm, has gained much attention as a potential delivery tool for brain diseases, including AD, due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, their efficient uptake by autologous cells, and their ability to be surface-modified with target-specific receptor ligands. Here, the engineering of hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes to overexpress Fe65, enabled the development of a novel exosome-based targeted drug delivery system, which carried Corynoxine-B (Cory-B, an autophagy inducer) to the APP overexpressed-neuron cells in the brain of AD mice. The Fe65-engineered HT22 hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes (Fe65-EXO) loaded with Cory-B (Fe65-EXO-Cory-B) hijacked the signaling and blocked the natural interaction between Fe65 and APP, enabling APP-targeted delivery of Cory-B. Notably, Fe65-EXO-Cory-B induced autophagy in APP-expressing neuronal cells, leading to amelioration of the cognitive decline and pathogenesis in AD mice, demonstrating the potential of Fe65-EXO-Cory-B as an effective therapeutic intervention for AD.",

Sleep disorders are one of the common chief complaints of neurodegenerative diseases. When patients suffer from comorbid sleep disorder and neurodegenerative diseases, the severity of their condition increases, the quality of their life drops further, and the difficulty of treatment increases. A large number of studies have been conducted to monitor the sleep of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and it has been found that there are significant changes in their polysomnography (PSG) results compared to those of healthy control populations. In addition, there are also significant differences between the PSG findings of patients with different neurodegenerative diseases and the differences are closely associated with the pathogenesis and development of the disease. Herein, we discussed the characteristics of the sleep structure of patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies and provided a brief review of the sleep disorders and the PSG characteristics of these patients. The paper will help improve the understanding of the pathogenesis and pathological changes of neurodegenerative diseases, clarify the relationship between sleep disorders and these diseases, improve clinicians' further understanding of these diseases, and provide a basis for future research. \u76ee\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u75c5\u56e0\u3001\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u7c7b\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u9884\u9632\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u53ca\u6cbb\u7597\u5e26\u6765\u96be\u9898\u3002\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\u662f\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u5e38\u89c1\u4e3b\u8bc9\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u5171\u75c5\u540e\uff0c\u52a0\u91cd\u4e86\u75c5\u60c5\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5927\u4e86\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u7761\u7720\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u4eba\u7fa4\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u5bfc\u7761\u7720\u56fe\uff08polysomnography, PSG\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u3001\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u3001\u4ea8\u5ef7\u987f\u75c5\u4ee5\u53ca\u8def\u6613\u4f53\u75f4\u5446\u60a3\u8005\u7761\u7720\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\u53caPSG\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u8981\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u75be\u75c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5bf9\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002",

GSE168522, the scRNA-seq dataset of AD peripheral blood immune cells, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and was analyzed in the RAD-Blood web server (http://www.bioinform.cn/RAD-Blood/). The changes in blood cell composition in AD patients were analyzed. The abnormal communications between different types of cells in AD patients were investigated by the CellChat R package. There were two kinds of CD8 + T cells in the blood of AD patients and healthy individuals, one of which highly expressed granzyme K ( GZMK) (false discovery rate [FDR]<0.05), and the other highly expressed GZMA, GZMB, and GZMH (FDR<0.05). In the blood of AD patients, the content of GZMK + CD8 + T cells was increased by 32.9% ( P=5.15E-21), their interactions with other cell types were increased, and they might be associated with AD through the abnormal signal transduction of major histocompatibility complex class \u2160 (MHC-\u2160). Erythrocyte provided the main ligands, that are, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class \u2160 molecules, including HLA- A, HLA- B, HLA- C, and HLA- E, for the abnormal MHC-\u2160 signaling pathway of GZMK + CD8 + T cells. The RESISTIN signaling pathway was specifically enriched in the blood of AD patients. The increased content of peripheral blood GZMK + CD8 + T cells, the increased interaction between GZMK + CD8 + T cells and erythrocytes, and the enhanced RESISTIN pathway are potential blood biomarkers of AD. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u7ec6\u80deRNA\u6d4b\u5e8f\uff08single cell RNA sequencing, scRNA-seq\uff09\u6316\u6398\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08Alzheimer's disease, AD\uff09\u5916\u5468\u8840\u514d\u75ab\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22AD\u5916\u5468\u8840\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u578b\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u901a\u8baf\u5f02\u5e38\u3002 \u4eceGEO\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u4e0b\u8f7dAD\u5916\u5468\u8840\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80descRNA-seq\u6570\u636e\u96c6GSE168522\uff0c\u4e8eRAD-Blood\u7f51\u9875\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff08http://www.bioinform.cn/RAD-Blood/\uff09\u4e2d\u5206\u6790AD\u60a3\u8005\u8840\u6db2\u7ec6\u80de\u7ec4\u6210\u6210\u5206\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528CellChat\u5206\u6790AD\u60a3\u8005\u8840\u6db2\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u95f4\u901a\u8baf\u4f5c\u7528\u3002 AD\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u4eba\u8840\u6db2\u4e2d\u6709\u4e24\u79cdCD8+ T\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u7c7b\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u9897\u7c92\u9176K\uff08granzyme K, GZMK\uff09\u3014\u4f2a\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\uff08false discovery rate, FDR\uff09<0.05\u3015\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u7c7b\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbeGZMA\u3001GZMB\u548cGZMH\uff08FDR<0.05\uff09\u3002GZMK+ CD8+ T\u7ec6\u80de\u5728AD\u60a3\u8005\u8840\u6db2\u4e2d\u542b\u91cf\u5347\u9ad832.9%\uff08P=5.15E-21\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u590d\u5408\u4f53\u2160\u7c7b\uff08major histocompatibility complex class \u2160, MHC-\u2160\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u5bfc\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0eAD\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u4e3aGZMK+ CD8+ T\u7ec6\u80deMHC-\u2160\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u5f02\u5e38\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u914d\u4f53\uff0c\u5373\u4eba\u7c7b\u767d\u7ec6\u80de\u6297\u539f\uff08human leukocyte antigen, HLA\uff09\u2160\u7c7b\u5206\u5b50\uff08HLA-A\u3001HLA-B\u3001HLA-C\u548cHLA-E\uff09\u3002\u8840\u6db2RESISTIN\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u4ec5\u5bcc\u96c6\u4e8eAD\u60a3\u8005\u8840\u6db2\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u662fAD\u8840\u6db2\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u3002 \u5916\u5468\u8840GZMK+ CD8+ T\u7ec6\u80de\u542b\u91cf\u5347\u9ad8\u3001GZMK+ CD8+ T\u7ec6\u80de\u4e0e\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u589e\u52a0\u3001RESISTIN\u901a\u8def\u589e\u5f3a\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u7684AD\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3002",

        "AbstractText": "The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is higher in people over the age of 65 and in African Americans (AA). Elevated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity has been considered a major player in the onset of AD symptoms. As a result, many FDA-approved AD drugs target AChE inhibition to treat AD patients. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a signaling molecule known to downregulate oxidative stress and inflammation. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the blood is widely used as a biomarker to monitor inflammation and immunity. This study examined the hypothesis that plasma AChE levels have a negative association with H2S levels and that a positive association exists between levels of NLR, HbA1c, and ROS with the AChE in the peripheral blood. The fasting blood sample was taken from 114 African Americans who had provided written informed consent approved by the IRB. The effect of H2S and high-glucose treatment on AChE activity levels was also investigated in THP-1 human monocytes. There was a significant negative relationship between AChE and the levels of H2S (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.41, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001); a positive association between the levels of AChE with age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.26, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), NLR (r\u00a0=\u00a00.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), ROS (r\u00a0=\u00a00.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and HbA1c levels (r\u00a0=\u00a00.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), in AA subjects. No correlation was seen between blood levels of AChE and acetylcholine (ACh). Blood creatinine had a negative correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) with ACh levels. There was a significant effect of H2S on AChE inhibition and of high glucose in upregulating AChE activity in cultured monocytes. This study suggests hyperglycemia and lower H2S status can contribute to an increase in the AChE activity levels. Future clinical studies are needed to examine the potential benefits of supplementation with hydrogen sulfide pro-drugs/compounds in reducing the AChE and the cognitive dysfunctions associated with AD.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Alzheimer's disease: The role of proteins in formation, mechanisms, and new therapeutic approaches.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS), leading to memory and cognitive decline. In AD, the brain experiences three main structural changes: a significant decrease in the quantity of neurons, the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and the formation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) or senile plaques, which are protein deposits found outside cells and surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Genetic studies have identified four genes associated with autosomal dominant or familial early-onset AD (FAD): amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The formation of plaques primarily involves the accumulation of A\u03b2, which can be influenced by mutations in APP, PS1, PS2, or ApoE genes. Mutations in the APP and presenilin (PS) proteins can cause an increased amyloid \u03b2 peptides production, especially the further form of amyloidogenic known as A\u03b242. Apart from genetic factors, environmental factors such as cytokines and neurotoxins may also have a significant impact on the development and progression of AD by influencing the formation of amyloid plaques and intracellular tangles. Exploring the causes and implications of protein aggregation in the brain could lead to innovative therapeutic approaches. Some promising therapy strategies that have reached the clinical stage include using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antioxidants, and antiapoptotic agents. The most hopeful therapeutic strategies involve inhibiting activity of secretase and preventing the \u03b2-amyloid oligomers and fibrils formation, which are associated with the \u03b2-amyloid fibrils accumulation in AD. Additionally, immunotherapy development holds promise as a progressive therapeutic approach for treatment of AD. Recently, the two primary categories of brain stimulation techniques that have been studied for the treatment of AD are invasive brain stimulation (IBS) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). In this article, the amyloid proteins that play a significant role in the AD formation, the mechanism of disease formation as well as new drugs utilized to treat of AD will be reviewed.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Discovery of FERM domain protein-protein interaction inhibitors for MSN and CD44 as a potential therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Proteomic studies have identified moesin (MSN), a protein containing a FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain, and the receptor CD44 as hub proteins found within a co-expression module strongly linked to AD traits and microglia. These proteins are more abundant in Alzheimer's patient brains, and their levels are positively correlated with cognitive decline, amyloid plaque deposition and neurofibrillary tangle burden. The MSN FERM domain interacts with the phospholipid PIP2 and the cytoplasmic tail of CD44. Inhibiting the MSN-CD44 interaction may help limit AD-associated neuronal damage. Here, we investigated the feasibility of developing inhibitors that target this protein-protein interaction. We have employed structural, mutational and phage-display studies to examine how CD44 binds to the FERM domain of MSN. Interestingly, we have identified an allosteric site located close to the PIP2 binding pocket that influences CD44 binding. These findings suggest a mechanism in which PIP2 binding to the FERM domain stimulates CD44 binding through an allosteric effect, leading to the formation of a neighboring pocket capable of accommodating a receptor tail. Furthermore, high-throughput screening of a chemical library identified two compounds that disrupt the MSN-CD44 interaction. One compound series was further optimized for biochemical activity, specificity, and solubility. Our results suggest that the FERM domain holds potential as a drug development target. The small molecule preliminary leads generated from this study could serve as a foundation for additional medicinal chemistry efforts with the goal of controlling microglial activity in AD by modifying the MSN-CD44 interaction.",

        "AbstractText": "Depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are substantial public health concerns. In the past decades, a link between two disease entities has received extensive acknowledgment, yet the complex nature of this relationship has demanded further clarification. Some evidence indicates that mid-life depression may be an AD risk factor, while a chronic course of depression in late life may be a precursor to or symptom of dementia. Recently, multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the bidirectional relationship between depression and AD, including genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, the accumulation of AD-related biomarkers (e.g., amyloid beta and tau), and alterations in brain structure. That being the case, numerous therapeutic approaches, such as pharmacology treatments, psychotherapy, and lifestyle interventions, have been suggested as potential means of interfering with these pathways. However, the current literature on this topic remains fragmented and lacks a comprehensive review characterizing the association between depression and AD. In this review, we aim to address these gaps by providing an overview of the co-occurrence and temporal relationship between depression and AD, as well as exploring their underlying mechanisms. We also examine the current therapeutic regimens for depression and their implications for AD management, and outline key challenges facing the field.",

        "AbstractText": "Every year, thousands of children, particularly those under five years old, die because of cerebral malaria (CM). Following conventional treatment, approximately 25% of surviving individuals have lifelong severe neurocognitive sequelae. Therefore, improved conventional therapies or effective alternative therapies that prevent the severe infection are crucial. Omega-3 (\u03a9-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and protect against diverse neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, little is known regarding the effects of \u03a9-3 PUFAs against parasitic infections. In this study, C57BL/6 mice received supplemental treatment of a fish oil rich in the \u03a9-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which was started 15 days prior to infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA and was maintained until the end of the study. Animals treated with the highest doses of DHA, 3.0 and 6.0 g/kg body weight, had 60 and 80% chance of survival, respectively, while all non-treated mice died by the 7th day post-infection due to CM. Furthermore, the parasite load during the critical period for CM development (5th to 11th day post-infection) was controlled in treated mice. However, after this period all animals developed high levels of parasitemia until the 20th day of infection. DHA treatment also effectively reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and brain edema and completely prevented brain hemorrhage and vascular occlusion. A strong anti-inflammatory profile was observed in the brains of DHA-treated mice, as well as, an increased number of neutrophil and reduced number of CD8+ T leukocytes in the spleen. Thus, this is the first study to demonstrate that the prophylactic use of DHA-rich fish oil exerts protective effects against experimental CM, reducing the mechanical and immunological events caused by the P. berghei ANKA infection.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The location, physiology, pathology of hippocampus Melatonin MT",
        "AbstractText": "Melatonin, a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland and regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, is synthesized and directly released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the third ventricle (3rdv), where it undergoes rapid absorption by surrounding tissues to exert its physiological function. The hippocampus, a vital structure in the limbic system adjacent to the ventricles, plays a pivotal role in emotional response and memory formation. Melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that primarily mediate melatonin's receptor-dependent effects. In comparison to the MT1 receptor, the widely expressed MT2 receptor is crucial for mediating melatonin's biological functions within the hippocampus. Specifically, MT2 receptor is implicated in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory processes, as well as neurogenesis and axogenesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated the involvement of MT2 receptors in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of Alzheimer's disease, depression, and epilepsy. This review focuses on the anatomical localization of MT2 receptor in the hippocampus, their physiological function in this region, and their signal transduction and pharmacological roles in neurological disorders. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive review of MT2 receptor ligands used in psychopharmacology and other MT2-selective ligands over recent years. Ultimately, we provide an outlook on future research for selective MT2 receptor drug candidates.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer Associated Diabetes Mellitus, commonly known as Type 3 Diabetes Mellitus (T3DM) is a distinct subtype of diabetes with a pronounced association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin resistance serves as a pivotal link between these two conditions, leading to diminished insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, and impaired glucose uptake. The brain, a vital organ in AD context, is also significantly impacted by insulin resistance, resulting in energy deficits and neuronal damage, which are hallmark features of the neurodegenerative disorder. To pave the way for potential therapeutic interventions targeting the insulin resistance pathway, it is crucial to comprehend the intricate pathophysiology of T3DM and identify the overlapped features between diabetes and AD. This comprehensive review article aims to explore various pathway such as AMPK, PPAR\u03b3, cAMP and P13K/Akt pathway as potential target for management of T3DM. Through the analysis of these complex mechanisms, our goal is to reveal their interdependencies and support the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies. The review extensively discusses several promising pharmaceutical candidates that have demonstrated dual drug action mechanisms, addressing both peripheral and cerebral insulin resistance observed in T3DM. These candidates hold significant promise for restoring insulin function and mitigating the detrimental effects of insulin resistance on the brain. The exploration of these therapeutic options contributes to the development of innovative interventions that alleviate the burden of T3DM and enhance patient care.",

The search for novel non-toxic and effective cholinesterase inhibitors for creating neuroprotective and neurotransmitter agents is an urgent interdisciplinary problem. For the first time, the application of water-soluble pillar[5]arenes containing amino acid residues as effective cholinesterase inhibitors was shown. The influence of the nature of aliphatic and aromatic alpha-amino acid residues (glycine, l-alanine, l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan) on self-assembly, aggregate's stability, cytotoxicity on A549 and LEK cells and cholinesterase inhibition was studied. It was found that the studied compounds with aliphatic amino acid residues showed a low inhibitory ability against cholinesterases. It was established that the pillar[5]arene containing fragments of l-phenylalanine is the most promising inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcM), the pillar[5]arene with l-tryptophan residues is the most promising inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcM).

        "AbstractText": "Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting half of persons with MS (PwMS). Cognitive reserve has been associated with delaying the onset and slowing the progression of CI in PwMS. Multilingualism has been demonstrated to be a protective factor against CI in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but has never been studied in PwMS. To explore if multilingualism is a protective factor against CI in PwMS. This is a retrospective cohort study of PwMS aged 18-59, with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing MS, fluent in English, who completed the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS) at the London (ON) MS Clinic. Any PwMS with a history of dementia or developmental delay, daily marijuana use, a major psychiatric disorder, or less than grade 9 education was excluded. We focused on the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMTR), immediate recall (-IR) and delayed recall (-DR) as it would be the least affected by language, as well as the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), as information processing speed is the most commonly affected domain in PwMS. One-way ANOVA was used to compare raw scores on the BVMTR and SDMT between groups (uni- vs. multillingual), while chi-square was used to compare impairment on BVMTR and SDMT between groups. The cohort consisted of 678 subjects. The mean age was 39.7 (\u00b1\u00a09.6) years with 501 (73.9\u00a0%) females (sex at birth), the mean duration of disease of 5.9 (\u00b1\u00a06.9) years, and mean years of education was 13.9 (\u00b12.2). The majority of subjects (563, 83\u00a0%) were unilingual and (115, 17\u00a0%) were multilingual; 102 subjects were bilingual and 13 subjects fluent in \u2265 three languages. English was the first language was in most of subjects (614, 90.6\u00a0%). There was no significant difference on the BVMTR-IR scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.189) or BVMTR-DR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.096) between groups. Similarly, there was no difference in the number of subjects impaired on the BVMTR-IR (X2 (1, N\u00a0=\u00a0678)\u00a0=\u00a03.167, p\u00a0=\u00a00.057) or BVMT-DR between groups (X2 (1, N\u00a0=\u00a0678)\u00a0=\u00a02.996, p\u00a0=\u00a00.083).

This study shows that multilingualism does not have a protective effect against CI in PwMS and does not play a role in enriching the cognitive reserve, in contrast to studies in AD. This difference may be explained by a different underlying pathological mechanism in these diseases and warrants further study.",

We aimed to explore the effects of the pharmacological treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and statins (STAT) on AD-related neuropathology and the potential benefits of their concurrent use. We investigated the effect of ACEI, STAT or combination of both by exploring the transcriptomic, proteomic and tau pathology profiles after treatment in both human patients and in P301S transgenic mice (PS19) modeling tauopathies and AD. We performed bioinformatic analysis of enriched pathways after treatment. Proteomics and transcriptomics analysis revealed proteins and genes whose expression is significantly changed in subjects receiving treatment with ACEI, STAT or combined drugs. In mice, treatment with the ACEI lisinopril significantly decreased brain levels of total tau (Tau) and phosphorylated tau (pTau)-181, while the STAT atorvastatin significantly reduced the levels of pTau-396. The combined therapy with lisinopril and atorvastatin significantly decreased Tau. Moreover, brain levels of lisinopril were negatively correlated with Tau. Among the others, CD200, ADAM22, BCAN and NCAM1 were significantly affected by treatments in both human subjects and transgenic mice.

Despite numerous efforts, effective inhibitors of A\u03b2 and tau aggregates have not been developed. Thus, we aimed to screen natural small molecules from crude extracts that target various pathologies and are prescribed for patients with neurological diseases. In this study, we screened 162 natural small molecules prescribed for neurological diseases and identified genipin and pyrogallol as hit compounds capable of simultaneously regulating the aggregation of A\u03b2 and tau K18. Moreover, we confirmed the dual modulatory effects of these compounds on the reduction of amyloid-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro and the disassembly of preformed A\u03b242 and tau K18 fibrils. Furthermore, we observed the alleviatory effects of genipin and pyrogallol against AD-related pathologies in triple transgenic AD mice. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations revealed the molecular interaction dynamics of genipin and pyrogallol with A\u03b242 and tau K18, providing insights into their suppression of aggregation. Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of genipin and pyrogallol as dual modulators for the treatment of AD by inhibiting aggregation or promoting dissociation of A\u03b2 and tau.",

The predicted MADD protein structure was designed by homology modeling and characterized through different computational resources. Donepezil and galantamine were implanted as standard drugs and drugs were screened out based on structural similarities.

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the brain deposition of insoluble amyloidogenic proteins, such as \u03b1-synuclein or Tau, and the concomitant deterioration of cell functions such as the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). The ALP is involved in the degradation of intracellular macromolecules including protein aggregates. ALP dysfunction due to inherited defects in lysosomal or non-lysosomal proteins causes a group of diseases called lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) because of abnormal accumulation of lysosomal degradation substrates. Supporting the contribution of ALP defects in neurodegenerative diseases, deposition of amyloidogenic proteins occurs in LSD. Moreover, heterozygous mutations of several ALP genes represent risk factors for Parkinson's disease. The reciprocal contribution of \u03b1-synuclein accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction have been extensively studied. However, whether this adverse crosstalk also embraces Tau pathology needs more investigation. Here, we show in human primary fibroblasts that Tau seeds isolated from the brain of Alzheimer's disease induce Tau accumulation in acidic degradative organelles and lysosomal stress. Furthermore, inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme mutated in Gaucher's disease and a main risk for Parkinson's disease, causes lysosomal dysfunction in primary fibroblasts and contributes to the accumulation of Tau. Considering the presence of Tau lesions in Parkinson's disease as well as in multiple neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, our data call for further studies on strategies to alleviate ALP dysfunction as new therapeutic opportunity for neurodegenerative diseases and LSD.",

The proteolytic shedding of TREM2 results in the release of soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), which is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It remains unknown whether sTREM2 regulates the pathogenesis of AD. Here we identified transgelin-2 (TG2) expressed on neurons as the receptor for sTREM2. The microglia-derived sTREM2 binds to TG2, induces RhoA phosphorylation at S188, and deactivates the RhoA-ROCK-GSK3\u03b2 pathway, ameliorating tau phosphorylation. The sTREM2 (77-89) fragment, which is the minimal active sequence of sTREM2 to activate TG2, mimics the inhibitory effect of sTREM2 on tau phosphorylation. Overexpression of sTREM2 or administration of the active peptide rescues tau pathology and behavioral defects in the tau P301S transgenic mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that the sTREM2-TG2 interaction mediates the cross-talk between microglia and neurons. sTREM2 and its active peptide may be a potential therapeutic intervention for tauopathies including AD.",

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused up to 33-55\u00a0% death rates in COVID-19 patients with malignant neoplasms and Alzheimer's disease. Given this scenario, we identified biological processes and pathways involved in various diseases which are most likely affected by COVID-19. The COVID-19 DisGeNET data set (v4.0) contains the associations between various diseases and human genes known to interact with viruses from Coronaviridae family and were obtained from the IntAct Coronavirus data set annotated with DisGeNET data. We constructed the disease-gene network to identify genes that are involved in various comorbid diseased states. Communities from the disease-gene network were identified using Louvain method and functional enrichment through over-representation analysis methodology was used to discover significant biological processes and pathways shared between COVID-19 and other diseases. The COVID-19 DisGeNET data set (v4.0) comprised of 828 human genes and 10,473 diseases (including various phenotypes) that together constituted nodes in the disease-gene network. Each of the 70,210 edges connects a human gene with an associated disease. The top 10 genes linked to most number of diseases were VEGFA, BCL2, CTNNB1, ALB, COX2, AGT, HLA-A, HMOX1, FGF2 and COMT. The most vulnerable group of patients thus discovered had comorbid conditions such as carcinomas, malignant neoplasms and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we identified 15 potentially useful biological processes and pathways for improved therapies. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the key mediator of angiogenesis in cancer. It is widely distributed in the brain and plays a crucial role in brain inflammation regulating the level of angiopoietins. With a degree of 1899, VEGFA was associated with maximum number of diseases in the disease-gene network. Previous studies have indicated that increased levels of VEGFA in the blood results in dyspnea, Pulmonary Edema (PE), Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In case of COVID-19 patients with neoplasms and other neurological symptoms, our results indicate VEGFA as a therapeutic target for inflammation suppression. As VEGFs are known to disproportionately affect cancer patients, improving endothelial permeability and vasodilation with anti-VEGF therapy could lead to suppression of inflammation and also improve oxygenation. As an outcome of our study, we make case for clinical investigations towards anti-VEGF therapies for such comorbid conditions affected by COVID-19 for better therapeutic outcomes.",

Plasma cholesterol does not pass the blood-brain barrier whereas its metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) can enter the brain. High 27-OHC in the brain has been suggested to mediate hypercholesterolemia-induced impairments of learning and memory through promoting amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation and facilitating synaptic disruption. In AD brains, the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) is elevated. Treating AD animals with HDAC inhibitors decreases amyloid-\u03b2 levels and synaptic damages, which leads to memory improvement. Whether HDAC activity is involved in the actions of 27-OHC is still uncertain. In this study, 4 weekly injections of 27-OHC/vehicle were given to rats followed by 3 daily injections of HDAC inhibitor trichostatin (TSA)/vehicle. The results of Morris water maze test reveal that all rats have intact spatial learning ability during the 5-d training phase.

Furthermore, 27-OHC treatments reduced the hippocampal levels of acetylated histone H3, acetylated \u03b1 tubulin, insulin-degrading enzyme and postsynaptic protein PSD-95, indicating that 27-OHC treatments may induce enhanced HDAC activity, decreased amyloid-\u03b2 clearance and synaptic disruption.

        "AbstractText": "The current work is focused on developing mannose-coated PLGA nanoparticles for delivering Donepezil and Memantine in one dosage form. The formulated nanoparticles were prepared using a simple emulsification technique. The final coated NPs exhibited 179.4\u00a0nm size and\u00a0-\u00a033.1\u00a0mV zeta potential and spherical shape. The concentration of IN-administrated MEM and DPZ mannose coated NPs in brain was ~573 and 207\u00a0ng/mL respectively. This amount accounts for 3 times more in comparison to uncoated NPs administered via intranasal and peroral routes. The plasma concentration of coated NPs administered via the intranasal route was various times less in comparison to other groups. In the field of pharmacodynamics, the administration of coated NPs via the IN route has shown superior efficacy in comparison to other groups in various investigations involving neurobehavioral assessments, gene expression analyses and biochemical estimations. The findings indicate that the IN route may be a potential avenue for delivering therapeutic agents using nanoparticles to treat neurological illnesses. This approach shows promise as a viable alternative to traditional dose forms and administration methods.",

However, subgroups of patients suffering from schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease have more in common than the neuropsychiatric nature of their condition, such as the expression of social dysfunction. The PRISM project presents here initial quantitative biological insights allowing the first steps toward a novel trans-diagnostic classification of psychiatric and neurological symptomatology intended to reinvigorate drug discovery in this area. In this study, we applied spectral clustering on digital behavioural endpoints derived from passive smartphone monitoring data in a subgroup of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease patients, as well as age matched healthy controls, as part of the PRISM clinical study. This analysis provided an objective social functioning characterization with three differential clusters that transcended initial diagnostic classification and was shown to be linked to quantitative neurobiological parameters assessed. This emerging quantitative framework will both offer new ways to classify individuals in biologically homogenous clusters irrespective of their initial diagnosis, and also offer insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these clusters.",

It remains unknown whether preventive treatment strategies applying this compound may be equally effective. We tested whether daily oral administration of AF710B (10\u00a0\u00b5g/kg) in 7-month-old, preplaque, McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats for 7 months, followed by a 4-week washout period, could prevent Alzheimer's\u00a0disease-like pathological hallmarks. Long-term AF710B treatment prevented the cognitive impairment of McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats. The effect was accompanied by a reduction in the number of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and the levels of A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 peptides in the cerebral cortex. AF710B treatment also reduced microglia and astrocyte recruitment toward\u00a0CA1 hippocampal A\u03b2-burdened neurons compared to vehicle-treated McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats, also altering the inflammatory cytokines profile. Lastly, AF710B treatment rescued the conversion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor precursor to its mature and biologically active form.

We described the phenotype and environmental associations of patients with neurological syndromes associated with antibodies against neuronal surface antigens who were referred to a tertiary center in the South of Brazil. All patients were tested for neuronal autoantibodies using cell-based assays. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 16 patients, 15 had subacute, and one had a progressive disease course. Among patients with subacute onset, 11 (73\u00a0%) were N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptor (NMDAr-IgG)+, 3 (20\u00a0%) were Leucine-rich Glioma-Inactivated-1 (LGI1-IgG)+, and 1 (6\u00a0%) was positive for Glycine receptor-IgG. The patient with a progressive disease course had antibodies against IgLON5. Most patients had disease onset in spring and summer suggesting environmental factors for the development of AE. Also, we observed a different pattern of brain lesions when NMDAr-IgG encephalitis followed herpes encephalitis and a previously unreported association with Rosai-Dorfman-Destombe disease. All patients with encephalopathy met criteria for possible AE and all proven NMDAr-IgG+ met criteria for NMDAr-IgG encephalitis. However, only one LGI1-IgG+ patient fulfilled clinical criteria for limbic encephalitis. All but one received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, 11 also had intravenous human immunoglobulin, and 4 plasma exchange. Furthermore, all patients received second-line immunotherapy. Importantly, most patients improved with immunotherapy, even when initiated later in the disease course. We identified seasonal variability associated with neuronal surface antibodies suggesting environmental triggers. Also, we described the coexistence of NMDAr-IgG encephalitis with histiocytosis. In our series, most patients received second-line immunotherapy. We observed neurologic improvement after treatment even in cases of delayed diagnosis. Increasing the recognition and availability of tests and treatments for these conditions is of paramount importance in low- and middle-income countries.",

Therefore, we created an AD-CO model using iPSCs derived from patients with familial AD forms and explored early events and the progression of AD pathogenesis. Our study demonstrated that COs derived from three AD-iPSC lines with PSEN1(A246E) or PSEN2(N141I) mutations developed the AD-specific markers in\u00a0vitro, yet they also uncover tissue patterning defects and altered development.

        "AbstractText": "In present times, a switch from chemical molecules towards natural products is taking place, and the latter is being increasingly explored in the management of diseases due to their broad range of therapeutic potential. Consumption of coffee is thought to reduce Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanism is still unexplored. Primarily, it is thought that components of coffee are the key players in making it a neuroprotectant. Caffeic acid (CA) is found in high quantities in coffee; thus, it is being increasingly explored to decipher its neuroprotection by various mechanisms. Iron is a toxic element in a free form capable of causing oxidative damage and ultimately contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, maintaining the proper iron levels is vital and human transferrin (Htf), a glycoprotein, is a key player in this aspect. In this work, we explored the binding mechanism of CA with Htf at the atomistic level, employing molecular docking and extensive molecular dynamics simulation (MD) approaches coupled with spectroscopic techniques in a bid to decipher the mode of interaction of CA with Htf. Molecular docking results demonstrated a strong binding affinity between CA and Htf. Furthermore, MD study highlighted the Htf-CA complex's stability and the ligand's minimal impact on Htf's overall structure. In silico approaches were further backed up by experimental approaches. Strong binding of CA with Htf was ascertained by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy observations. Together, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the Htf-CA interaction, adding to the knowledge of the use of CA in the treatment of AD, thereby adding another feather to its already known neuroprotective role.",

        "AbstractText": "There are currently no drugs that meaningfully slow down the progression of Huntington's disease (HD). Moreover, drug candidates against a single molecular target have not had significant success. Therefore, a different approach to HD drug discovery is needed. Previously we showed that the flavonol fisetin is efficacious in mouse and fly models of HD (Hum. Mol. Gen. 20:261, 2011). It is also effective in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), ischemic stroke, and the CNS complications of diabetes, all of which share some pathological features with HD. Potent derivatives of fisetin with improved pharmacology were made that maintain its multiple biological activities (J. Med. Chem. 55:378, 2012). From 160 synthetic fisetin derivatives, one, CMS121, was selected for further study in the context of HD based on pharmacological parameters and its efficacy in animal models of AD. Both R6/2 and YAC128 mouse models of HD were used in these studies. We examined motor function using multiple assays as well as survival. In the R6/2 mice, we also looked at the effects of CMS121 on striatal gene expression. In both models, we found a slowing of motor dysfunction and an increase in median life span. Interestingly, in the YAC128 mice, the effects on the slowing in motor function loss became increasingly more pronounced as the mice aged. CMS121 also reduced HD-driven changes in the expression of genes associated with the proteasome and oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, these results suggest that CMS121 could provide some benefits for HD patients, particularly with regard to increasing health span.",

However, the link between age-related hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease is still unclear. We selected subjects with no history of exposure to loud noises, blasts, head trauma with hearing loss, or sudden sensorineural hearing loss from a cohort intended to study preclinical phases of Alzheimer's disease. Participants are volunteers over 55\u00a0years without cognitive impairment. We correlated the results of an objective auditory evaluation with brain amyloid and p-tau181 levels and with the outcomes of a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Fifty-five subjects at different stages of the Alzheimer's disease continuum were evaluated. There were no statistically significant correlations between amyloid-\u03b2 and p-tau levels and any of the objective auditory measures. A weak but significant correlation was found between amyloid-\u03b2 values and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly. The neuropsychological domains more correlated to hearing loss were executive function and processing speed. Age-related hearing loss is not linked to any pathological markers of Alzheimer's disease nor to neuropsychological domains typically affected in this disease. The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly has an important component of subjectivity and further studies are needed to explore its relationship with amyloid-\u03b2 levels.",

Trichostatin A (TSA) has been revealed to show protective effect on central nervous systems in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of TSA on cognitive function of DE are unknown. Here, we demonstrated that cognitive function was damaged in diabetic mice versus normal mice and treatment with TSA improved cognitive function in diabetic mice. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus revealed 174 differentially expressed proteins in diabetic mice compared with normal mice. TSA treatment reversed the expression levels of 111 differentially expressed proteins grouped into functional clusters, including the longevity regulating pathway, the insulin signaling pathway, peroxisomes, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction network analysis of TSA-reversed proteins revealed that UBA52, CAT, RPL29, RPL35A, CANX, RPL37, and PRKAA2 were the main hub proteins. Multiple KEGG pathway-enriched CAT and PRKAA2 levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of diabetic mice versus normal mice, which was reversed by TSA administration. Finally, screening for potential similar or ancillary drugs for TSA treatment indicated that HDAC inhibitors ISOX, apicidin, and panobinostat were the most promising similar drugs, and the PI3K inhibitor GSK-1059615, the Aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib, and the nucleophosmin inhibitor avrainvillamide-analog-6 were the most promising ancillary drugs. In conclusion, our study revealed that CAT and PRKAA2 were the key proteins involved in the improvement of DE after TSA treatment. ISOX, apicidin, and panobinostat were promising similar drugs and that GSK-1059615, alisertib, and avrainvillamide-analog-6 were promising ancillary drugs to TSA in the treatment of DE.",

Individual variation in sleep behaviours may be a source of variability in the effectiveness of exercise-induced cognitive change, however this has not yet been investigated. The current study aimed to (1) investigate the influence of a 6-month exercise intervention on sleep, assessed pre- and post-intervention and, (2) investigate whether baseline sleep measures moderate exercise-induced cognitive changes. We utilised data from the Intense Physical Activity and Cognition (IPAC) study (n\u00a0=\u00a089), a 6-month moderate intensity and high intensity exercise intervention, in cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling older adults aged 60-80 (68.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.32). Exercise was supervised and completed on a stationary exercise bicycle, and cognitive function was measured using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery administered pre- and post-intervention. Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. There was no effect of the exercise intervention on any sleep outcomes from pre- to post-intervention. There was a significant moderating effect of baseline sleep efficiency on both episodic memory and global cognition within the moderate intensity exercise group, such that those with poorer sleep efficiency at baseline showed greater exercise-induced improvements in episodic memory. These results suggest that those with poorer sleep may have the greatest exercise-induced cognitive benefits and that baseline sleep behaviours may be an important source of heterogeneity in previous exercise interventions targeting cognitive outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "Aggravated neuronal loss, caused mainly by neuronal apoptosis, is observed in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and animal models of AD. A truncated form of Dual-specific and tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) plays a vital role in AD pathogenesis. Downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL is tightly correlated with neuronal loss in AD. However, the molecular regulation of neuronal apoptosis and Bcl-x expression by Dyrk1A in AD remains largely elusive. Here, we aimed to explore the role and molecular mechanism of Dyrk1A in apoptosis. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), flow cytometry, and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) were used to check apoptosis. The cells, transfected with Dyrk1A or/and ASF with Bcl-x minigene, were used to assay Bcl-x expression by RT-PCR and Western blots. Co-immunoprecipitation, autoradiography, and immunofluorescence were conducted to check the interaction of ASF and Dyrk1A. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of apoptosis-related genes was performed in mice overexpressing Dyrk1A (TgDyrk1A) and AD model 5xFAD mice. Dyrk1A promoted Bcl-xS expression and apoptosis. Splicing factor ASF promoted Bcl-x exon 2b inclusion, leading to increased Bcl-xL expression. Dyrk1A suppressed ASF-mediated Bcl-x exon 2b inclusion via phosphorylation. The C-terminus deletion of Dyrk1A facilitated its binding and kinase activity to ASF. Moreover, Dyrk1a1-483 further suppressed the ASF-mediated Bcl-x exon 2b inclusion and aggravated apoptosis. The truncated Dyrk1A, increased Bcl-xS, and enrichment of apoptosis-related genes was observed in the brain of 5xFAD mice. We speculate that increased Dyrk1A and truncated Dyrk1A may aggravate neuronal apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS via phosphorylating ASF in AD.",

This study included four groups: normal (NC), MCI stable (MCIs), MCI converted to AD (MCIs), and mild AD (M-AD) groups. Magnetic resonance image analysis software was used to quantify the hippocampus, ILV, and QMTA. MTA was rated by two experienced neurologists. Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed to compare their capability in differentiating AD from NC and MCI, and optimal thresholds were determined using the Youden index. QMTA distinguished M-AD from NC and MCI with higher diagnostic accuracy than MTA, hippocampus, and ILV (AUCNC \u2009=\u20090.976, AUCMCI \u2009=\u20090.836, AUCMCIs \u2009=\u20090.894, AUCMCIc \u2009=\u20090.730).

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative disease is a collective term for a category of diseases that are caused by neuronal dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs without the 3' cap and 5' poly(A) and are linked by covalent bonds. CircRNAs are highly expressed in brain neurons and can regulate the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting the levels of various deposition proteins. This review is aiming to suggest that the majority of circRNAs influence neurodegenerative pathologies mainly by affecting the abnormal deposition of proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. We systematically summarized the pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases and the regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in various types of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative disease main features include intercellular ubiquitin-proteasome system abnormalities, changes in cytoskeletal proteins, and the continuous deposition of insoluble protein fragments and inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm or nucleus, resulting in impairment of the normal physiological processes of the neuronal system. CircRNAs have multiple mechanisms, such as acting as microRNA sponges, binding to proteins, and regulating transcription. CircRNAs, which are highly stable molecules, are expected to be potential biomarkers for the pathological detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. In this review, we describe the regulatory roles and mechanisms of circRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases and aim to employ circRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Impaired autophagy in plaque-associated microglia (PAM) has been reported to accelerate amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive impairment in AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that the transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is a promising treatment approach for AD. Moreover, the complementary therapy of intermittent hypoxia therapy (IHT) has been shown to upregulate autophagy and impart beneficial effects in patients with AD. However, the effect of IHT on PAM remains unknown. 8-Month-old APP/PS1 mice were treated with IHT for 28 days. Spatial learning memory capacity and anxiety in mice were investigated. AD pathology was determined by the quantity of nerve fibers and synapses density, numbers of microglia and neurons, A\u03b2 plaque deposition, pro-inflammatory factors, and the content of A\u03b2 in the brain. TFEB-mediated autophagy was determined by western blot and qRT-PCR. Primary microglia were treated with oligomeric A\u03b2 1-42 (oA\u03b2) combined with IHT for mechanism exploration. Differential genes were screened by RNA-seq. Autophagic degradation process of intracellular oA\u03b2 was traced by immunofluorescence. In this study, we found that IHT ameliorated cognitive function by attenuating neuronal loss and axonal injury in an AD animal model (APP/PS1 mice) with beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) pathology. In addition, IHT-mediated neuronal protection was associated with reduced A\u03b2 accumulation and plaque formation. Using an in vitro PAM model, we further confirmed that IHT upregulated autophagy-related proteins, thereby promoting the A\u03b2 autophagic degradation by PAM. Mechanistically, IHT facilitated the nuclear localization of TFEB in PAM, with TFEB activity showing a positive correlation with A\u03b2 degradation by PAM in vivo and in vitro. In addition, IHT-induced TFEB activation was associated with the inhibition of the AKT-MAPK-mTOR pathway. These results suggest that IHT alleviates neuronal damage and neuroinflammation via the upregulation of TFEB-dependent A\u03b2 clearance by PAM, leading to improved learning and memory in AD mice. Therefore, IHT may be a promising non-pharmacologic therapy in complementary medicine against AD.",

We included participants aged 18 years or older with symptomatic sporadic small vessel disease or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and an indication for antihypertensive treatment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three sequences of antihypertensive treatment using a computer-generated multiblock randomisation, stratified by study site and patient group. A 2-week washout period was followed by three 4-week periods of oral monotherapy with amlodipine, losartan, or atenolol at approved doses.

Efficacy analyses were done by intention-to-treat principles in all randomly assigned participants who had at least one valid assessment for the primary endpoint, and analyses were done separately for participants with sporadic small vessel disease and CADASIL.

No deaths occurred. Two serious adverse events were recorded, one while taking amlodipine (diarrhoea with dehydration) and one while taking atenolol (fall with fracture), neither of which was related to study drug intake. 4 weeks of treatment with amlodipine, losartan, or atenolol did not differ in their effects on cerebrovascular reactivity in people with sporadic small vessel disease but did result in differential treatment effects in patients with CADASIL. Whether antihypertensive drug classes differentially affect clinical outcomes in people with small vessel diseases requires further research. EU Horizon 2020 programme.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, are associated with microgliosis. Microglia have long been considered to have detrimental roles in Alzheimer's disease. However, functional analyses of genes encoding risk factors that are linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and that are enriched or exclusively expressed in microglia, have revealed unexpected protective functions. One of the major risk genes for Alzheimer's disease is TREM2. Risk variants of TREM2 are loss-of-function mutations affecting chemotaxis, phagocytosis, lipid and energy metabolism, and survival and proliferation. Agonistic anti-TREM2 antibodies have been developed to boost these protective functions in patients with intact TREM2 alleles. Several anti-TREM2 antibodies are in early clinical trials, and current efforts aim to achieve more efficient transport of these antibodies across the blood-brain barrier. PET imaging could be used to monitor target engagement. Data from animal models, and biomarker studies in patients, further support a rationale for boosting TREM2 functions during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Hyperactivity of granule cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) promotes vulnerability to chronic stress. However, which receptors in the vDG could be targeted to inhibit this hyperactivity and confer stress resilience is not known. The serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR) is a Gi protein coupled inhibitory receptor that has been implicated in stress adaptation, anxiety, depression, and antidepressant responses. 5HT1ARs are highly expressed in the DG, but their potential to promote stress resilience by regulating granule cell activity has never been examined. We exposed male and female mice expressing 5HT1ARs only in DG granule cells to 10 days of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and treated them with the 5HT1AR agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) every day 30 min before each defeat throughout the CSDS paradigm. We then used whole-cell current clamp recordings, immunohistochemistry for the immediate early gene, cFos, corticosterone immunoassays, and behavioral testing to determine how activating 5HT1ARs on granule cells affects DG activity, neuroendocrine stress responses, and avoidance behavior. We find that activating 5HT1ARs hyperpolarizes DG granule cells and reduces cFos+ granule cells in the vDG following CSDS, indicating that 5HT1AR activation rescues stress-induced vDG hyperactivity. Moreover, 5HT1AR activation dampens corticosterone responses to CSDS and prevents the development of stress-induced avoidance in the social interaction test and in the open field test. Our findings show that activating 5HT1ARs on DG granule cells can prevent stress-induced neuronal hyperactivity of the vDG and confer resilience to chronic stress.",

        "AbstractText": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is an important driver of Tau pathology, gliosis, and degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Still, the mechanisms underlying these APOE4-driven pathological effects remain elusive. Here, we report in a tauopathy mouse model that APOE4 promoted the nucleocytoplasmic translocation and release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from hippocampal neurons, which correlated with the severity of hippocampal microgliosis and degeneration. Injection of HMGB1 into the hippocampus of young APOE4-tauopathy mice induced considerable and persistent gliosis. Selective removal of neuronal APOE4 reduced HMGB1 translocation and release. Treatment of APOE4-tauopathy mice with HMGB1 inhibitors effectively blocked the intraneuronal translocation and release of HMGB1 and ameliorated the development of APOE4-driven gliosis, Tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and myelin deficits. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that treatment with HMGB1 inhibitors diminished disease-associated and enriched disease-protective subpopulations of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in APOE4-tauopathy mice. Thus, HMGB1 inhibitors represent a promising approach for treating APOE4-related AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, is essential for neuronal function, and it acts on ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). A disturbance in glutamatergic signaling is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Developing disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative diseases targeting glutamate receptors is a promising avenue. The understudied group III mGluR 4, 6-8 are commonly found in the presynaptic membrane, and their activation inhibits glutamate release. Thus, targeted mGluRs therapies could aid in treating neurodegenerative diseases. This review describes group III mGluRs and their pharmacological ligands in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. Attempts to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs in clinical trials are also discussed. Despite a growing list of group III mGluR-specific pharmacological ligands, research on the use of these drugs in neurodegenerative diseases is limited, except for Parkinson's disease. Future efforts should focus on delineating the contribution of group III mGluR to neurodegeneration and developing novel ligands with superior efficacy and a favorable side effect profile for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Computerized testing has become more widely used in clinical trials; however, it is unclear how sensitive these measures are to early signs of neurodegeneration. We investigated the use of the NIH Toolbox-Cognition (NIHTB-CB) and Cogstate-Brief computerized neuropsychological batteries in the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus healthy older adults [healthy control (HC)] and amnestic (aMCI) versus nonamnestic MCI (naMCI). Exploratory analyses include investigating potential racial differences. Two hundred six older adults were diagnosed as aMCI (n = 58), naMCI (n = 15), or cognitively healthy (HC; n = 133). The NIH Toolbox-CB subtests of Flanker, Picture Sequence Memory, and Picture Vocabulary significantly differentiated MCI from HC. Further, subtests from both computerized batteries differentiated patients with aMCI from those with naMCI. Although the main effect of race differences was noted on tests and in diagnostic groups was significant, there were no significant race-by-test interactions. Computer-based subtests vary in their ability to help distinguish MCI subtypes, though these tests provide less expensive and easier-to-administer clinical screeners to help identify patients early who may qualify for more comprehensive evaluations. Further work is needed, however, to refine computerized tests to achieve better precision in distinguishing impairment subtypes.",

Among others, the use of cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) has been proposed as a putative approach based on their anti-inflammatory effects. Methods: The present work was designed to explore the effects of chronic (28 days) treatment with low doses of cannabinoids: CBD (0.273\u2009mg/kg), THC (0.205\u2009mg/kg) or a combination of both (CBD:THC; 0.273\u2009mg/kg:0.205\u2009mg/kg) in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. Results: Our data revealed that THC-treated 5xFAD mice (but not other treatment groups) exhibited anxiogenic and depressant-like behavior. A significant improvement in spatial memory was observed only in the CBD:THC-treated group. Interestingly, all cannabinoid-treated groups showed significantly increased cortical levels of the insoluble form of beta amyloid 1-42. These effects were not accompanied by changes in molecular parameters of inflammation at the mRNA or protein level. Conclusions: These data reveal differential effects of chronic, low-dose cannabinoids and point to a role of these cannabinoids in the processing of amyloid peptides in the brains of 5xFAD mice.",

        "AbstractText": "This study was designed to identify common genetic susceptibility and shared genetic variants associated with acute radiation-induced toxicity (RIT) across four cancer types (prostate, head and neck, breast, and lung). A GWAS meta-analysis was performed using 19 cohorts including 12,042 patients. Acute standardized total average toxicity (rSTATacute) was modelled using a generalized linear regression model for additive effect of genetic variants adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. LD score regression estimated shared SNP-based heritability of rSTATacute in all patients and for each cancer type. Shared SNP-based heritability of STATacute among all cancer types was estimated at 10% (se\u2009=\u20090.02), and was higher for prostate (17%, se\u2009=\u20090.07), head and neck (27%, se\u2009=\u20090.09), and breast (16%, se\u2009=\u20090.09) cancers. We identified 130 suggestive associated SNPs with rSTATacute (5.0x10-8<P-value<1.0x10-5) across 25 genomic regions. rs142667902 showed the strongest association (effect allele A; effect size -0.17; P-value=1.7x10-7), which is located near DPPA4, encoding a protein involved in pluripotency in stem cells, which are essential for repair of radiation-induced tissue injury. Gene-set enrichment analysis identified 'RNA splicing via endonucleolytic cleavage and ligation' (P\u2009=\u20095.1 x10-6, Pcorrected =0.079) as the top gene set associated with rSTATacute among all patients. In-silico gene expression analysis showed the genes associated with rSTATacute were statistically significantly up-regulated in skin (not sun exposed Pcorrected=0.004; sun exposed Pcorrected=0.026). There is shared SNP-based heritability for acute RIT across and within individual cancer sites. Future meta-GWAS among large radiotherapy patient cohorts are worthwhile to identify the common causal variants for acute radiotoxicity across cancer types.",

        "AbstractText": "With the global rise in Alzheimer disease (AD), early screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a preclinical stage of AD, is of paramount importance. Although biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid amyloid level and magnetic resonance imaging have been studied, they have limitations, such as high cost and invasiveness. Digital markers to assess cognitive impairment by analyzing behavioral data collected from digital devices in daily life can be a new alternative. In this context, we developed a \"virtual kiosk test\" for early screening of MCI by analyzing behavioral data collected when using a kiosk in a virtual environment. We aimed to investigate key behavioral features collected from a virtual kiosk test that could distinguish patients with MCI from healthy controls with high statistical significance. Also, we focused on developing a machine learning model capable of early screening of MCI based on these behavioral features. A total of 51 participants comprising 20 healthy controls and 31 patients with MCI were recruited by 2 neurologists from a university hospital. The participants performed a virtual kiosk test-developed by our group-where we recorded various behavioral data such as hand and eye movements. Based on these time series data, we computed the following 4 behavioral features: hand movement speed, proportion of fixation duration, time to completion, and the number of errors. To compare these behavioral features between healthy controls and patients with MCI, independent-samples 2-tailed t tests were used. Additionally, we used these behavioral features to train and validate a machine learning model for early screening of patients with MCI from healthy controls. In the virtual kiosk test, all 4 behavioral features showed statistically significant differences between patients with MCI and healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, patients with MCI had slower hand movement speed (t49=3.45; P=.004), lower proportion of fixation duration (t49=2.69; P=.04), longer time to completion (t49=-3.44; P=.004), and a greater number of errors (t49=-3.77; P=.001). All 4 features were then used to train a support vector machine to distinguish between healthy controls and patients with MCI. Our machine learning model achieved 93.3% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity, 90% precision, and 94.7% F1-score. Our research preliminarily suggests that analyzing hand and eye movements in the virtual kiosk test holds potential as a digital marker for early screening of MCI. In contrast to conventional biomarkers, this digital marker in virtual reality is advantageous as it can collect ecologically valid data at an affordable cost and in a short period (5-15 minutes), making it a suitable means for early screening of MCI. We call for further studies to confirm the reliability and validity of this approach.",

Process evaluation of performed RCTs is essential to inform future interventions. Still, it is rarely carried out, resulting in an overly optimistic view of the impact of eHealth interventions on loneliness in older adults and options to conduct such research entirely remotely. We describe a mixed methods process evaluation of a digitally conducted RCT assessing the effectiveness of a mobile social gaming app to facilitate meaningful social interactions in older adults. We analyzed the questionnaire and game data of the RCT participants to evaluate recruitment and onboarding, intervention adherence, and intervention acceptability. The RCT participants were allocated either to the main group of older adults (aged 65 years or older) or the side group (aged between 18 and 64 years). The side group used networking to play with the older adults. We also conducted 6 post-RCT evaluation interviews and 1 focus group with a total of 4 RCT participants and 5 welfare organization representatives that aided in RCT recruitment. In total, 371 people aged 18 years or older signed up for the RCT, of which 64% (238/371) were aged 65 years or older. Of the total sample, 20% (76/371) installed the app and signed informed consent, showing a large dropout during onboarding. The high number of questions was a relevant barrier for participants. Both questionnaire and gameplay adherence were low. Participants indicated that the games elicited contact and a feeling of togetherness and proposed challenging and competitive games with increasing difficulty levels. They suggested focusing on enjoying the games rather than administering questionnaires. Conducting a remote digital trial of a social gaming intervention for older adults is a great challenge. Remote recruitment and informed consent acquisition may often not result in sufficient participation. Personal engagement with fellow participants and researchers might be essential for adherence and enjoyment. Future digital gaming interventions should start with small-scale studies with in-person contact, repeated instructions, and fewer questionnaires.",

We performed voxel-based analysis and visually inspected brain perfusion SPECT images for regional brain atrophy, occipital hypoperfusion and the cingulate island sign (CIS), for differential diagnosis of MCI-LB and MCI-AD. MRI showed no significant differences in regional atrophy between the MCI-LB and MCI-AD groups. In MCI-LB subjects, occipital rCBF was significantly decreased compared with MCI-AD subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.01, family wise error [FWE]-corrected). Visual inspection of occipital hypoperfusion had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values of 100%, 73.2% and 89.1%, respectively, for differentiating MCI-LB and MCI-AD. Occipital hypoperfusion was offered higher diagnostic utility than the CIS. The occipital lobe was the region with significantly decreased rCBF in MCI-LB compared with MCI-AD subjects.

An algorithmic approach to formulating pharmacotherapy is proposed, based upon which combination of changed activities by brain cell-types is dominant for any particular condition, because those cell-types contain and surrogate for genetic, metabolic and environmental information, that has affected their function. The algorithm performs because functions of some or all the affected cell-types benefit from several available drugs: clemastine, dantrolene, erythropoietin, fingolimod, fluoxetine, lithium, memantine, minocycline, pioglitazone,\u00a0piracetam, and riluzole PROCEDURES/FINDINGS: Bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and post-traumatic stress disorder, illustrate the algorithm; for them, literature reviews show that no single combination of altered cell-types accounts for all cases; but they identify, for each condition, which combination occurs most frequently, i.e., dominates, as compared with other possible combinations. Knowing the dominant combination of altered cell-types in a particular condition, permits formulation of therapy with combinations of drugs taken from the above list. The percentage of patients who might benefit from that therapy, depends upon the frequency with which the dominant combination occurs in patients with that particular condition. Knowing the dominant combination of changed cell types in psychiatric conditions, permits an algorithmically formulated, rationally-based treatment. Different studies of the same condition often produce discrepant results; all might be correct, because identical clinical phenotypes result from different combinations of impaired cell-types, thus producing different results.

        "AbstractText": "Sleep quality is critical for improving mental health among older adults. Despite this, there is a dearth of studies examining the correlation between sleep quality and emotional symptoms in the elderly population of China. This study included 496 community elders aged 55 years and older. The participants were divided into two groups based on their scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with 249 being classified as poor sleepers and 247 as good sleepers. All participants were asked to fill out a uniform survey which included details about their demographics, daily habits, and any illnesses they were dealing with. The Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were employed to measure their levels of anxiety and depression, respectively. In addition, 50 healthy individuals also agreed to brain MR imaging. The finding of our study indicated that those with inadequate sleep had higher levels of depression and anxiety, and the overall anxiety and depression score was linked to the total PSQI score in a positive manner; The MRI subgroup analysis revealed that those with inadequate sleep quality had a greater thickness of the left transverse temporal gyrus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, a Linear regression analysis of the mediation model showed that poor sleep quality would result in higher scores on the GDS, and cortical thickness in the left transverse temporal gyrus played a fully mediated role in this process. Our research indicates that elderly people in community who have difficulty sleeping may be more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression, and this lack of sleep can result in depressive symptoms due to its impact on the thickness of the left transverse temporal cortex.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Memantine increases the dendritic complexity of hippocampal young neurons in the juvenile brain after cranial irradiation.",
        "AbstractText": "Cranial irradiation (IR) negatively regulates hippocampal neurogenesis and causes cognitive dysfunctions in cancer survivors, especially in pediatric patients. IR decreases proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPC) and consequently diminishes production of new hippocampal neurons. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, used clinically to improve cognition in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia. In animal models, memantine acts as a potent enhancer of hippocampal neurogenesis. Memantine was recently proposed as an intervention to improve cognitive impairments occurring after radiotherapy and is currently under investigation in a number of clinical trials, including pediatric patients. To date, preclinical studies investigating the mechanisms underpinning how memantine improves cognition after IR remain limited, especially in the young, developing brain. Here, we investigated whether memantine could restore proliferation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) or rescue the reduction in the number of hippocampal young neurons after IR in the juvenile mouse brain. Mice were whole-brain irradiated with 6 Gy on postnatal day 20 (P20) and subjected to acute or long-term treatment with memantine. Proliferation in the SGZ and the number of young neurons were further evaluated after the treatment. We also measured the levels of neurotrophins associated with memantine improved neural plasticity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). We show that acute intraperitoneal treatment with a high, non-clinically used, dose of memantine (50 mg/kg) increased the number of proliferating cells in the intact brain by 72% and prevented 23% of IR-induced decrease in proliferation. Long-term treatment with 10 mg/kg/day of memantine, equivalent to the clinically used dose, did not impact proliferation, neither in the intact brain, nor after IR, but significantly increased the number of young neurons (doublecortin expressing cells) with radial dendrites (29% in sham controls and 156% after IR) and enhanced their dendritic arborization. Finally, we found that long-term treatment with 10 mg/kg/day memantine did not affect the levels of BDNF, but significantly reduced the levels of NGF by 40%. These data suggest that the enhanced dendritic complexity of the hippocampal young neurons after treatment with memantine may contribute to the observed improved cognition in patients treated with cranial radiotherapy.",

        "AbstractText": "To determine the extent to which the regional brain volumes associated with slow gait speed can inform subsequent cognitive decline in older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We utilized deformation-based morphometry (DBM) in a whole-brain exploratory approach to identify the regional brain volumes associated with gait speed assessed over a short distance during an in-home assessment. We created deformation scores to summarize the gait-associated regions and entered the scores into a series of longitudinal mixed effects models to determine the extent to which deformation predicted change in cognition over time, controlling for associations between gait and cognition. In 438 older adults (81\u2009\u00b1\u20097; 76% female), DBM revealed that slower gait speed was associated with smaller volumes across frontal white matter, temporal grey matter, and subcortical areas and larger volumes in the ventricles during the same testing cycle. When a subset was followed over multiple (5\u2009\u00b1\u20092) years, slower gait speed was also associated with annual declines in global cognition, executive functioning, and memory abilities. Several of the gait-related brain structures were associated with these declines in cognition; however, larger ventricles and smaller medial temporal lobe volumes proved most robust and attenuated the association between slow gait and cognitive decline. Regional brain volumes in the ventricles and temporal lobe associated with both slow gait speed and faster cognitive decline have potential to improve risk stratification for cognitive decline in older adults.",

AD is neuropathologically characterized by the presence of beta-amyloid immunoreactive senile plaques and tau positive neurofibrillary tangles. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD however continue to be underscored, and therefore, neuropathological correlates of these neuropsychiatric symptoms are not readily studied. Presented here is a case of 60-year-old female who initially presented with anxiety and depression, and continued to be the predominant symptoms although mild cognitive impairment was noted as per the available clinical notes. Postmortem examination of the brain revealed severe Alzheimer's type neuropathological changes, which included significant tau and beta-amyloid pathology in limbic regions, which were thought to represent correlates of the patient's depression and anxiety. This case report illustrates the possible neuropathological correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD.

In early midlife, they also show reduced verbal episodic memory and hippocampal volume. Whether these reductions correlate with a sleep phenotype consistent with insomnia risk remains unexplored. We recruited thirty-one younger middleaged women with risk-reducing early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), fifteen of whom were taking estradiol-based hormone replacement therapy (BSO+ERT) and sixteen who were not (BSO). Fourteen age-matched premenopausal (AMC) and seventeen spontaneously peri-postmenopausal (SM) women who were ~10y older and not taking ERT were also enrolled. Overnight polysomnography recordings were collected at participants' home across multiple nights (M=2.38 SEM=0.19), along with subjective sleep quality and hot flash ratings. In addition to group comparisons on sleep measures, associations with verbal episodic memory and medial temporal lobe volume were assessed. Increased sleep latency and decreased sleep efficiency were observed on polysomnography recordings of those not taking ERT, consistent with insomnia symptoms. This phenotype was also observed in the older women in SM, implicating ovarian hormone loss. Further, sleep latency was associated with more forgetting on the paragraph recall task, previously shown to be altered in women with early BSO. Both increased sleep latency and reduced sleep efficiency were associated with smaller anterolateral entorhinal cortex volume. Together, these findings confirm an association between ovarian hormone loss and insomnia symptoms, and importantly, identify an younger onset age in women with early ovarian removal, which may contribute to poorer cognitive and brain outcomes in these women.",

However, identifying objective biomarkers that can predict brain stimulation efficacy, remains a challenge. The primary aim of this investigation is to delineate the cerebral regions implicated in AD, taking into account the existing lacuna in comprehension of these regions. In pursuit of this objective, we have employed a supervised machine learning algorithm to prognosticate the neurophysiological outcomes resultant from the confluence of tDCS therapy plus cognitive intervention within both the cohort of responders and non-responders to antecedent tDCS treatment, stratified on the basis of antecedent cognitive outcomes. The data were obtained through an interventional trial. The study recorded high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) in 70\u2009AD patients and analyzed spectral power density during a 6\u2009min resting period with eyes open focusing on a fixed point. The cognitive response was assessed using the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. The training process was carried out through a Random Forest classifier, and the dataset was partitioned into K equally-partitioned subsamples. The model was iterated k times using K-1 subsamples as the training bench and the remaining subsample as validation data for testing the model. A clinical discriminating EEG biomarkers (features) was found. The ML model identified four brain regions that best predict the response to tDCS associated with cognitive intervention in AD patients. These regions included the channels: FC1, F8, CP5, Oz, and F7. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG features can provide valuable information on the likelihood of cognitive response to tDCS plus cognitive intervention in AD patients. The identified brain regions may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting treatment response and maybe guide a patient-centered strategy. https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02772185?term=NCT02772185&draw=2&rank=1, identifier ID: NCT02772185.",

The eligible subjects were assigned to one of three dosage groups, intranasally administrated with ahaMSCs-Exos two times per week for 12 weeks, and underwent follow-up visits at weeks 16, 24, 36 and 48. No adverse events were reported.

Moreover, the ADAS-cog scores in the medium-dose arm decreased continuously by 3.98 points until week 36. There were no significant differences in altered amyloid or tau deposition among the three arms, but hippocampal volume shrank less in the medium-dose arm to some extent. Intranasal administration of ahaMSCs-Exos was safe and well tolerated, and a dose of at least 4\u00d7108 particles could be selected for further clinical trials. NCT04388982.",

        "AbstractText": "Due to the insidious progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), surrogate decision-makers typically make medical and long-term-care decisions for a care recipient, most often a family care partner. Unfortunately, many care recipient/care partner dyads have failed to engage in advance care planning or have lost the opportunity to do so due to the cognitive decline of the care recipient. To address this need, our team created a validated dementia-focused advance care planning tool known as the LEAD Guide (Life-Planning in Early Alzheimer's and Other Dementias). With funding from the National Alzheimer's Association and in consultation with our community advisory board, we developed a preliminary web-based intervention. This intervention integrates the LEAD Guide with self-paced educational modules that lead dyads through conversations and dementia-focused advance care planning processes. In this concept paper, we describe the aims of our funded R01 clinical trial (National Institute on Aging), where we aim to refine our preliminary web-based platform for use in a 5-month mixed-method NIH Stage-1 behavioral intervention. Using a sample of diverse community-based ADRD dyads (n = 60), we aim to: 1) describe the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of the intervention, 2) assess the initial efficacy of the intervention on the primary outcome (decision-making self-efficacy), and secondary outcomes (relationship quality, subjective well-being, anxiety) as perceived by both the care recipient and the care partner, and 3) examine advance care planning congruence as a mechanism of action. The LEAD clinical trial addresses public health challenges by guiding and supporting families through challenging advance care planning conversations, facilitating the transfer of knowledge regarding care preferences and values from the care recipient to the care partner, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for both individuals with ADRD and their care partners.",

Partial correlation was used to examine the relationship between global and regional amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation and cognitions.

Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative illness in the long run. The rate of advancement might vary, even though it is a progressive neurological illness. Various explanations have been proposed, however the true etiology of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. Most pharmacological interventions are based on the cholinergic theory, that is earliest idea. In accordance with the amyloid hypothesis, the buildup of beta-amyloid in brain regions is the primitive cause of illness. There is no proof that any one strategy is useful in avoiding Alzheimer's disease, though some epidemiological studies have suggested links within various modifiable variables, such as cardiovascular risk, diet and so on.

Examples include the self-assembly of phenylalanine, which causes phenylketonuria; A\u03b2, which causes Alzheimer's disease; the tau protein, which causes both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases; and \u03b1-synuclein, which causes Parkinson's illness. This review provides information related to phytochemicals of great significance that can prevent the formation of, or destabilize, amino acid, peptide, and protein self-assemblies.",

        "AbstractText": "About half of people living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment, education, and support. We previously developed a tool, eRADAR, which uses information in the electronic health record (EHR) to identify patients who may have undiagnosed dementia. This paper provides the protocol for an embedded, pragmatic clinical trial (ePCT) implementing eRADAR in two healthcare systems to determine whether an intervention using eRADAR increases dementia diagnosis rates and to examine the benefits and harms experienced by patients and other stakeholders. We will conduct an ePCT within an integrated healthcare system and replicate it in an urban academic medical center. At primary care clinics serving about 27,000 patients age 65 and above, we will randomize primary care providers (PCPs) to have their patients with high eRADAR scores receive targeted outreach (intervention) or usual care. Intervention patients will be offered a \"brain health\" assessment visit with a clinical research interventionist mirroring existing roles within the healthcare systems. The interventionist will make follow-up recommendations to PCPs and offer support to newly-diagnosed patients. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both study arms will be followed to identify new diagnoses of dementia in the EHR (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include healthcare utilization from the EHR and patient, family member and clinician satisfaction assessed through surveys and interviews. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and intervention could be adopted by other healthcare systems, potentially improving dementia detection, patient care and quality of life.",

Low level of Cys might induce hepatic injury, edema and growth retardation, while superfluous level of Cys is found to be closely relevant to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this work, a novel near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe PFQ-C was developed for highly selective detection of Cys in living cells and mice by utilizing the cyclization removal reaction between acrylate group and Cys. The superior sensitivity (limit of detection, 0.036\u00a0\u03bcM), NIR emission (655\u00a0nm), large Stokes shift (135\u00a0nm) and low cytotoxicity of the probe highlight its broad potential for future clinical applications.

        "AbstractText": "APOE genotype is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 increases AD risk up to 12-fold compared to APOE3, an effect that is greater in females. Evidence suggests that one-way APOE could modulate AD risk and progression through neuroinflammation. Indeed, APOE4 is associated with higher glial activation and cytokine levels in AD patients and mice. Therefore, identifying pathways that contribute to APOE4-associated neuroinflammation is an important approach for understanding and treating AD. Human and in vivo evidence suggests that TLR4, one of the key receptors involved in the innate immune system, could be involved in APOE-modulated neuroinflammation. Consistent with that idea, we previously demonstrated that the TLR4 antagonist IAXO-101 can reduce LPS- and A\u03b2-induced cytokine secretion in APOE4 glial cultures. Therefore, the goal of this study was to advance these findings and determine whether IAXO-101 can modulate neuroinflammation, A\u03b2 pathology, and behavior in mice that express APOE4. We used mice that express five familial AD mutations and human APOE3 (E3FAD) or APOE4 (E4FAD). Female and male E4FAD mice and female E3FAD mice were treated with vehicle or IAXO-101 in two treatment paradigms: prevention from 4 to 6\u00a0months of age or reversal from 6 to 7\u00a0months of age. Learning and memory were assessed by modified Morris water maze. A\u03b2 deposition, fibrillar amyloid deposition, astrogliosis, and microgliosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Soluble levels of A\u03b2 and apoE, insoluble levels of apoE and A\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2 were measured by ELISA. IAXO-101 treatment resulted in lower Iba-1 coverage, lower number of reactive microglia, and improved memory in female E4FAD mice in both prevention and reversal paradigms. IAXO-101-treated male E4FAD mice also had lower Iba-1 coverage and reactivity in the RVS paradigm, but there was no effect on behavior. There was also no effect of IAXO-101 treatment on neuroinflammation and behavior in female E3FAD mice. Our data supports that TLR4 is a potential mechanistic therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation and cognition in APOE4 females.",

Resting-state 21-channel EEG was recorded in 148 amyloid-positive AD patients (MCI, n\u2009=\u200988; dementia due to AD, n\u2009=\u200960). Two or more EEG recordings were available for all subjects. We computed whole-brain and regional relative power (i.e., theta (4-8\u00a0Hz), alpha1 (8-10\u00a0Hz), alpha2 (10-13\u00a0Hz), beta (13-30\u00a0Hz)), peak frequency, signal variability (i.e., theta permutation entropy), and functional connectivity values (i.e., alpha and beta corrected amplitude envelope correlation, theta phase lag index, weighted symbolic mutual information, inverted joint permutation entropy). Whole-group linear mixed effects models were used to model the development of EEG measures over time. Group-wise analysis was performed to investigate potential differences in change trajectories between the MCI and dementia subgroups. Finally, we estimated the minimum sample size required to detect different treatment effects (i.e., 50% less deterioration, stabilization, or 50% improvement) on the development of EEG measures over time, in hypothetical clinical trials of 1- or 2-year duration. Whole-group analysis revealed significant regional and global oscillatory slowing over time (i.e., increased relative theta power, decreased beta power), with strongest effects for temporal and parieto-occipital regions. Disease severity at baseline influenced the EEG measures' rates of change, with fastest deterioration reported in MCI patients. Only AD dementia patients displayed a significant decrease of the parieto-occipital peak frequency and theta signal variability over time. We estimate that 2-year trials, focusing on amyloid-positive MCI patients, require 36 subjects per arm (2 arms, 1:1 randomization, 80% power) to detect a stabilizing treatment effect on temporal relative theta power. Resting-state EEG measures could facilitate early detection of treatment effects on neuronal function in AD patients. Their sensitivity depends on the region-of-interest and disease severity of the study population. Conventional spectral measures, particularly recorded from temporal regions, present sensitive AD treatment monitoring markers.",

Here we aggregated genetic and neuroimaging data from 61,974 participants (age range, 9 to 98 years) in five cohorts to elucidate the genetic basis of ventricular morphology and examined their overlap with neuropsychiatric traits. Genome-wide association analysis in a discovery sample of 31,880 individuals identified 62 unique loci and 785 candidate genes associated with ventricular morphology. We replicated over 80% of loci in a well-matched cohort of lateral ventricular volume. Gene set analysis revealed enrichment of ventricular-trait-associated genes in biological processes and disease pathogenesis during both early brain development and degeneration. We explored the age-dependent genetic associations in cohorts of different age groups to investigate the possible roles of ventricular-trait-associated loci in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes. We describe the genetic overlap between ventricular and neuropsychiatric traits through comprehensive integrative approaches under correlative and causal assumptions. We propose the volume of the inferior lateral ventricles as a heritable endophenotype to predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease, which might be a consequence of prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides an advance in understanding the genetics of the cerebral ventricles and demonstrates the potential utility of ventricular measurements in tracking brain disorders and maintaining brain health across the lifespan.",

While apolipoprotein E (APOE) is known to modify AD risk, it remains unclear how microglial apoE impacts brain cognition and AD pathology. Here, using conditional mouse models expressing apoE isoforms in microglia and central nervous system-associated macrophages (CAMs), we demonstrate a cell-autonomous effect of apoE3-mediated microglial activation and function, which are negated by apoE4. Expression of apoE3 in microglia/CAMs improves cognitive function, increases microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and reduces amyloid pathology and associated toxicity, whereas apoE4 expression either compromises or has no effects on these outcomes by impairing lipid metabolism. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling reveals increased antigen presentation and interferon pathways upon apoE3 expression. In contrast, apoE4 expression downregulates complement and lysosomal pathways, and promotes stress-related responses. Moreover, in the presence of mouse endogenous apoE, microglial apoE4 exacerbates amyloid pathology. Finally, we observed a reduction in Lgals3-positive responsive microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and an increased accumulation of lipid droplets in APOE4 human brains and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. Our findings establish critical isoform-dependent effects of microglia/CAM-expressed apoE in brain function and the development of amyloid pathology, providing new insight into how apoE4 vastly increases AD risk.",

In addition to amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and tau, neuroinflammation is a crucial element in the etiology of this disease. However, the relevance of inflammasome-induced pyroptosis to AD is unknown. We aimed to clarify whether the anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin could prevent A\u03b2-mediated activation of the inflammasome. We demonstrated that A\u03b2 upregulated NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD, and cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase caspase (caspase 1) expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1). Melatonin prevented inflammasome signaling and excessive cytokine release caused by A\u03b2. We found that ethyl 2[(2-chlorophenyl)(hydroxy) methyl]acrylate (INF-4E, NLRP3 and caspase 1 inhibitor) significantly abolished A\u03b2-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression. The increase in cleaved-caspase 1, pro-IL18, and cleaved-IL18 caused by A\u03b2 suggested the occurrence of pyroptosis, which was further confirmed by the increased expression of N-terminal gasdermin D (N-GSDMD). Melatonin plays a protective role against A\u03b2-induced inflammation via an inflammasome-associated mechanism that is essential in inducing the active forms of cytokines and pyroptosis. The ability of melatonin to inhibit inflammasome may represent a turning point in the treatment of AD progression.",

However, concerns that the overexpression paradigm might have affected the phenotype remain. Amyloid precursor protein (APP)-knock-in (KI) mice, incorporating APP mutations associated with AD development, offer an alternative approach for overproducing pathogenic A\u03b2 without needing overexpression of APP. Here, we present the results of comprehensive analyses of pathological and biochemical traits in the brains of APP-KI mice harboring APP-associated familial AD mutations (APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice) crossed with human APOE-KI mice. Immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses revealed the APOE genotype-dependent increase in A\u03b2 pathology and glial activation, which was evident within 8 months in the mouse model. These results suggested that this mouse model may be valuable for investigating APOE pathobiology within a reasonable experimental time frame.

Recently, ginsenoside-Re (G-Re) has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, whether G-Re has an effect on multiple sclerosis (MS), a representative autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), has not been revealed yet. The purpose of this study was to investigate pharmacological effects of G-Re and related molecular mechanisms using a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide-immunized experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of MS and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bEND.3 cells as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). G-Re attenuated motor impairment of EAE, demyelination, and inflammation in spinal cords of EAE mice. G-Re reduced infiltration/activation of microglia/macrophages and decreased mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), chemokines (MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and RANTES), and enzymes (iNOS) in spinal cords of EAE mice. G-Re inhibited alterations of BBB constituents (such as astrocytes, cell adhesion molecule (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1), and tight junctional molecules (occludin and zonula occludens-1)) and toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MyD88/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways in spinal cords of EAE mice and LPS-stimulated bEND.3 cells. Interestingly, combination treatment with G-Re and TLR4 inhibitor (TAK242) significantly inhibited the upregulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway in LPS-stimulated bEND.3 cells. TLR4 inhibitor- and activator-treated EAE mice showed conflicting behavior patterns. G-Re might alleviate motor impairment of EAE and its pathological/inflammatory events in the spinal cord by preventing BBB disruption via downregulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.

Besides, the improvement on cognitive deficit, pathological defects, reactive astrocyte clusters, inhibition on neuronal inflammation and apoptosis were further studied in 3 x Tg-AD mice model of AD. Real-time PCR, western blot, dot blot, biolayer interferometry and bioinformatics analysis were used to confirm the in vitro effect and targets of raddeanin A on \u03b2-amyloidosis and its associated protein network. A series of experiments including Morris water maze, H&E staining, nissl staining and immunofluorescence analysis were conducted to confirm the protective behavioral effect of raddeanin A in the in vivo AD mice model.

        "AbstractText": "Background: Physical distancing and visiting restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic particullarly posed significant challenges in providing timely medical care in nursing homes. Virtual visits were pivotal in providing both scheduled and urgent patient care in addition to in-person care when possible. These virtual visits could have been used to provide urgent medical care than the regular scheduled visits. We hypothesize that regular non-COVID-19-related virtual visits in the evaluated nursing home facilities were lower than COVID-19-related virtual visits during this period. The objective was to compare the frequency of COVID-19-related virtual visits with non-COVID-19-related virtual visits performed in three suburban nursing homes in Michigan from December 2020 through February 2022. Methods: Retrospective chart review of 283 patients, comprising 563 virtual visits. The most frequent ICD-10 diagnostic codes used by providers for primary encounters were analyzed for three participating facilities Results: Only 13.8% (78/563) of all virtual visits during the study period were for COVID-19 as a primary encounter. In total 86.1% (485/563) of visits were non-COVID-19 related, which comprised most frequently M6281 muscle weakness (45), E119 diabetes type with complications (20), NI86 end-stage renal disease (11), N390 urinary tract infection (10), G309 Alzheimer's disease (10), and I4891 unspecified atrial fibrillation (10). Conclusion: We found that the primary ICD-10 diagnosis codes for virtual COVID-19-related visits were significantly lower than non-COVID-19-related virtual visits in our study population. This trend could be associated with multiple system-based factors. Further studies to examine factors responsible for these findings are warranted.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an extremely prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in the regulation of AD. However, the function of most lncRNAs in AD remains to be elucidated. In this study, the effects of lncRNA ENST00000440246.1 on the biological characteristics of AD were explored. Differentially expressed lncRNAs in AD were identified through bioinformatics analysis and peripheral blood from thirty AD patients was collected to verify the expression of these lncRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The correlations between lncRNAs and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were assessed by Pearson's correlation analysis. Immunofluorescence (IF), Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays were conducted to evaluate the biological effect of ENST00000440246.1 and protein phosphatase 2\u00a0A (PP2A) in SK-N-SH cells. Gene expression at the protein and mRNA levels was analyzed by Western blotting and RT-qPCR. The interaction between PP2A and ENST00000440246.1 was confirmed by IntaRNA and RNA pulldown assays. ENST00000440246.1 was upregulated and significantly negatively correlated with the MMSE and MoCA scores and the overexpression of ENST00000440246.1 inhibited cell proliferation and facilitated apoptosis and A\u03b2 expression in SK-N-SH cells. Mechanistically, ENST00000440246.1 targeted PP2A and regulated AD-related gene expression. The silencing of ENST00000440246.1 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, PP2A overexpression reversed the influence of ENST00000440246.1 overexpression in SK-N-SH cells. In conclusion, ENST00000440246.1 could promote AD progression by targeting PP2A, which indicates that ENST00000440246.1 has the potential to be a diagnostic target in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Autophagy involves the sequestration and delivery of cytoplasmic materials to lysosomes, where proteins, lipids, and organelles are degraded and recycled. According to the way the cytoplasmic components are engulfed, autophagy can be divided into macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Recently, many studies have found that autophagy plays an important role in neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, neuronal excitotoxicity, and cerebral ischemia. Autophagy maintains cell homeostasis in the nervous system via degradation of misfolded proteins, elimination of damaged organelles, and regulation of apoptosis and inflammation. AMPK-mTOR, Beclin 1, TP53, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and other signal pathways are involved in the regulation of autophagy and can be used as potential therapeutic targets for neurological diseases. Here, we discuss the role, functions, and signal pathways of autophagy in neurological diseases, which will shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of neurological diseases and suggest novel targets for therapies.",

Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity.

BPA can be found in epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics, which are frequently used in food storage and baby bottles. However, BPA can bind mainly to estrogen receptors, interfering with various neurologic functions, its use is a topic of significant concern. Nonetheless, the neurotoxicity of BPA has not been fully understood despite numerous investigations on its disruptive effects. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the most recent studies on the implications of BPA on the neurologic system. Our findings suggest that BPA exposure impairs various structural and molecular brain changes, promoting oxidative stress, changing expression levels of several crucial genes and proteins, destructive effects on neurotransmitters, excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation, damaged blood-brain barrier function, neuronal damage, apoptosis effects, disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, increase in reactive oxygen species, promoted apoptosis and intracellular lactate dehydrogenase release, a decrease of axon length, microglial DNA damage, astrogliosis, and significantly reduced myelination. Moreover, BPA exposure increases the risk of developing neurologic diseases, including neurovascular (e.g. stroke) and neurodegenerative (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) diseases. Furthermore, epidemiological studies showed that the adverse effects of BPA on neurodevelopment in children contributed to the emergence of serious neurological diseases like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), depression, emotional problems, anxiety, and cognitive disorders. In summary, BPA exposure compromises human health, promoting the development and progression of neurologic disorders. More research is required to fully understand how BPA-induced neurotoxicity affects human health.",

        "AbstractText": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in long-lived human populations have led to identification of variants associated with Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease, the latter being the most common cause of mortality in people worldwide. In contrast, naturally occurring cancer represents the leading cause of death in pet dogs, and specific breeds like the Golden Retriever (GR) carry up to a 65% cancer-related death rate. We hypothesized that GWAS of long-lived GRs might lead to the identification of genetic variants capable of modifying longevity within this cancer-predisposed breed. A GWAS was performed comparing GR dogs\u2009\u2265\u200914\u00a0years to dogs dying prior to age 12 which revealed a significant association to ERBB4, the only member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family capable of serving as both a tumor suppressor gene and an oncogene. No coding variants were identified, however, distinct haplotypes in the 5'UTR were associated with reduced lifespan in two separate populations of GR dogs. When all GR dogs were analyzed together (n\u2009=\u2009304), the presence of haplotype 3 was associated with shorter survival (11.8\u00a0years vs. 12.8\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.024). GRs homozygous for haplotype 3 had the shortest survival, and GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 had the longest survival (11.6\u00a0years vs. 13.5\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.0008). Sub-analyses revealed that the difference in lifespan for GRs carrying at least 1 copy of haplotype 3 was specific to female dogs (p\u2009=\u20090.009), whereas survival remained significantly different in both male and female GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 or haplotype 3 (p\u2009=\u20090.026 and p\u2009=\u20090.009, respectively). Taken together, these findings implicate a potential role for ERBB4 in GR longevity and provide evidence that within-breed canine lifespan studies could serve as a mechanism to identify favorable or disease-modifying variants important to the axis of aging and cancer.",

The concept of self-propagation via protein conformational changes, originally discovered for the prion protein (PrP), also applies to other proteins that exhibit similar behavior, such as alpha-synuclein (aSyn), a central player in Parkinson's disease and in other synucleinopathies. aSyn pathology appears to spread from one cell to another during disease progression, and involves the misfolding and aggregation of aSyn. How the transfer of aSyn between cells occurs is still being studied, but one important hypothesis involves receptor-mediated transport. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that the cellular prion protein (PrPC ) may play a crucial role in this process. PrPC has been shown to act as a receptor/sensor for protein aggregates in different neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the interaction between aSyn and PrPC and discuss its role in synucleinopathies. We examine the properties of PrP and aSyn, including their structure, function, and aggregation. Additionally, we discuss the current understanding of PrPC 's role as a receptor/sensor for aSyn aggregates and identify remaining unanswered questions in this area of research. Ultimately, we posit that exploring the interaction between aSyn and PrPC may offer potential treatment options for synucleinopathies.",

AD polygenic risk scores (PRS) were tested for association with DS-related traits. The AD risk PRS was associated with disease status in several cohorts of sporadic late- and early-onset and familial late-onset AD, but not in familial early-onset AD or DS. On the other hand, lower DS Mental Status Examination memory scores were associated with higher PRS, independent of intellectual disability and APOE (PRS including APOE, PRSAPOE , p\u00a0=\u00a02.84\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-4 ; PRS excluding APOE, PRSnonAPOE , p\u00a0=\u00a01.60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-2 ). PRSAPOE exhibited significant associations with A\u03b242, tTau, pTau, and A\u03b242/40 ratio in DS. These data indicate that the AD genetic architecture influences cognitive and CSF phenotypes in DS adults, supporting common pathways that influence memory decline in both traits. Examination of the polygenic risk of AD in DS presented here is the first of its kind. AD PRS influences memory aspects in DS individuals, independently of APOE genotype. These results point to an overlap between the genes and pathways that leads to AD and those that influence dementia and memory decline in the DS population.

The contribution of the ENS to the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease has been described in the literature, while some other studies have found a connection between epilepsy and the gastrointestinal tract. The above could be explained by cholinergic neurons and neurotransmission systems in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, regulating the vagal excitability effect. It is also understandable, as the discharges arising in the amygdala are transmitted to the intestine through projections the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, giving rise to efferent fibers that stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and consequently the symptoms at this level. Therefore, this review's main objective is to argue in favor of the existing relationship of the ENS with the Central Nervous System (CNS) as a facilitator of epileptogenic or ictogenic mechanisms. The gut microbiota also participates in this interaction; however, it depends on many individual factors of each human being. The link between the ENS and the CNS is a poorly studied epileptogenic site with a big impact on one of the most prevalent neurological conditions such as epilepsy.",

The in vitro neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity of the synthesized compounds determined using SHSY5Y cell line and HEPG2 cell line. One most active compound (AF1) with least toxicity in in vitro studies was chosen for in vivo studies. Acute and subacute toxicity of the novel compound AF1 conducted on Wistar rats according to OECD guideline 423 and 407. The LD50 value of the novel compound calculated according to Finney's method using Probit analysis. Anti-Alzheimer's activity studies conducted on male Wistar rats. Behavioral studies conducted and AChE and MAO-B activity determined in rat brain. All the compounds exhibited good inhibitory effect on MAO B and AChE. The neurotoxicity studies of the active compound AF1 did not show toxicity up to 100\u03bcg. The hepatotoxicity study of the most active compound AF1, showed the compound to be safe up to 200\u03bcg. The LD 50 value of the novel compound after a single oral administration was found to be 64 mg/kg bodyweight in rats. Subacute toxicity studies did not show any remarkable toxicity in the vital organs up to 40 mg/kg. Activity studies showed comparable results with standard at 20 mg/kg.

In this curated review, we focus on what is known about sex differences in classic mechanisms of stress response, such as glucocorticoid hormones and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), which are components of the hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis. Then, we present sex differences in neurotransmitter levels, such as serotonin, dopamine, glutamate and GABA, as well as indices of neurodegeneration, such as amyloid \u03b2 and Tau. Gonadal hormone effects, such as estrogens and testosterone, are also discussed throughout the review. We also review in detail preclinical data investigating sex differences caused by recentlyrecognized regulators of stress and disease, such as the immune system, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, as well neurosteroids. Finally, we discuss how understanding sex differences in stress responses, as well as in pharmacology, can be leveraged into novel, more efficacious therapeutics for all. Based on the supporting evidence, it is obvious that incorporating sex as a biological variable into preclinical research is imperative for the understanding and treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease.",

Their intricate structures, however, present significant challenges, limiting our understanding of their functions, regulatory mechanisms, and potential applications in biomedicine and technology. This study evaluated the AlphaFold2 ColabFold method's structure predictions for antimicrobial amyloids, using eight antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including those with experimentally determined structures and AMPs known for their distinct amyloidogenic morphological features. Additionally, two well-known human amyloids, amyloid-\u03b2 and islet amyloid polypeptide, were included in the analysis due to their disease relevance, short sequences, and antimicrobial properties. Amyloids typically exhibit tightly mated \u03b2-strand sheets forming a cross-\u03b2 configuration. However, certain amphipathic \u03b1-helical subunits can also form amyloid fibrils adopting a cross-\u03b1 structure. Some AMPs in the study exhibited a combination of cross-\u03b1 and cross-\u03b2 amyloid fibrils, adding complexity to structure prediction. The results showed that the AlphaFold2 ColabFold models favored \u03b1-helical structures in the tested amyloids, successfully predicting the presence of \u03b1-helical mated sheets and a hydrophobic core resembling the cross-\u03b1 configuration. This implies that the AI-based algorithms prefer assemblies of the monomeric state, which was frequently predicted as helical, or capture an \u03b1-helical membrane-active form of toxic peptides, which is triggered upon interaction with lipid membranes.",

We included 1018 participants (mean age 47.3\u00b17.4 years at mid-life and 73.2\u00b17.3 at late-life). At the 140/90 mm\u2005Hg cutoff, the hypertension-hypertension trend was associated with higher free water (\u03b2, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.03-0.30]; P=0.021) and peak skeletonized mean diffusivity (\u03b2, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.01-0.29]; P=0.033). At a 130/80 mm\u2005Hg cutoff, the hypertension-hypertension trend had significantly higher free water (\u03b2, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.01-0.30]; P=0.035); and the normotension-hypertension (\u03b2, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.03-0.44]; P=0.027) and hypertension-hypertension (\u03b2, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.04-0.41]; P=0.022) trends had significantly increased white matter hyperintensity volume. Exploratory stratified analysis showed effect modifications by APOE \u025b4 allele and age. Mid-to-late-life hypertension exposure is significantly associated with microstructural and to a lesser extent, visible white matter injury; the effects are observed at both conventional and lower blood pressure cutoffs and are associated with longer duration of hypertension.",

The bibliometric analysis was done to reflect the relevance and understanding of KBS in recent literature.\u00a0The SCOPUS database was utilized to conduct a search for all articles with the terms \"Kluver-Bucy\" and \"Kluver Bucy\" from January 1, 1955 (the first available articles from the search) to February 1, 2023. The parameters included in this analysis were article title, citation numbers, citations per year, authors, institutions, publishing journals, country of origin, Source Normalized Impact per Paper, and Scopus CiteScore. Since 1937, when Kluver-Bucy Syndrome was first defined, the publications on KBS have steadily increased, with up to six publications a year in 2002. The most common institutions were SUNY Upstate Medical University, VA Medical Center, and the State University of New York (SUNY) System. Seven of these papers were published in Neurology. Almost 75% of the articles were published in journals of medicine and neuroscience. This is the first bibliometric analysis to evaluate the most influential publications about Kluver-Bucy Syndrome. A majority of the research is case-based and there is a dearth of clinical trials to identify the exact pathophysiology and physiotherapy management, possibly owing to the rarity of the disease. Our research suggests that there may be a significant overlap between Sanfilippo syndrome and KBS, suggesting that refined guidelines for establishing diagnosis may be required for children. Our study could bring a renewed interest in this field and lead to additional research focused on understanding the pathophysiology of KBS in order to promote the development of novel diagnostics and treatment.",

Altered glial phagocytosis has been implicated in several neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease. To untangle the links between glial phagocytosis and neurodegeneration, we investigated Drosophila mutants lacking the phagocytic receptor Draper. Loss of Draper leads to persistent neuronal cell corpses and age-dependent neurodegeneration. Here we investigate whether the phagocytic defects observed in draper mutants lead to chronic increased immune activation that promotes neurodegeneration. We found that the antimicrobial peptide Attacin-A is highly upregulated in the fat body of aged draper mutants and that the inhibition of the Immune deficiency (Imd) pathway in the glia and fat body of draper mutants led to reduced neurodegeneration. Taken together, these findings indicate that phagocytic defects lead to neurodegeneration via increased immune signaling, both systemically and locally in the brain.",

We propose a factor regression model for data with heterogeneous subpopulations. The proposed model can be represented as a decomposition of heterogeneous and homogeneous terms. The heterogeneous term is driven by latent factors in different subpopulations. The homogeneous term captures common variation in the covariates and shares common regression coefficients across subpopulations. Our proposed model attains a good balance between a global model and a group-specific model. The global model ignores the data heterogeneity, while the group-specific model fits each subgroup separately. We prove the estimation and prediction consistency for our proposed estimators, and show that it has better convergence rates than those of the group-specific and global models. We show that the extra cost of estimating latent factors is asymptotically negligible and the minimax rate is still attainable. We further demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method by studying its prediction error under a mis-specified group-specific model. Finally, we conduct simulation studies and analyze a data set from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and an aggregated microarray data set to further demonstrate the competitiveness and interpretability of our proposed factor regression model.",

        "AbstractText": "Throughout their lives, humans encounter a plethora of substances capable of inducing neurotoxic effects, including drugs, heavy metals and pesticides. Neurotoxicity manifests when exposure to these chemicals disrupts the normal functioning of the nervous system, and some neurotoxic agents have been linked to neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The growing concern surrounding the neurotoxic impacts of both naturally occurring and man-made toxic substances necessitates the identification of animal models for rapid testing across a wide spectrum of substances and concentrations, and the utilization of tools capable of detecting nervous system alterations spanning from the molecular level up to the behavioural one. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is gaining prominence in the field of neuroscience due to its versatility. The possibility of analysing all developmental stages (embryo, larva and adult), applying the most common \"omics\" approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, etc.) and conducting a wide range of behavioural tests makes zebrafish an excellent model for neurotoxicity studies. This review delves into the main experimental approaches adopted and the main markers analysed in neurotoxicity studies in zebrafish, showing that neurotoxic phenomena can be triggered not only by exposure to chemical substances but also by fluctuations in temperature. The findings presented here serve as a valuable resource for the study of neurotoxicity in zebrafish and define new scenarios in ecotoxicology suggesting that alterations in temperature can synergistically compound the neurotoxic effects of chemical substances, intensifying their detrimental impact on fish populations.",

In support of this view, we discussed the following: (1) the biochemical, cellular (preclinical), and clinical phases of AD; (2) survival after AD; (3) AD therapeutics and potential implications for the population with AD in the advanced stages. On the bases of the prolonged preclinical phase in AD, promising advances in AD therapeutics and the varying survival after AD, we proposed a new classification for AD and more broadly neurodegenerative disorders to be recognized as chronic life-limiting illnesses rather than terminal diseases with important implications for patients with AD in the advanced stages given the challenges that are specific to this population.",

Here, we study the mechanism that controls substrate processing by \u03b3-secretases and A\u03b2 peptide length. We found that polar interactions established by the APPC99 ectodomain (ECD), involving but not limited to its juxtamembrane region, restrain both the extent and degree of \u03b3-secretases processive cleavage by destabilizing enzyme-substrate interactions. We show that increasing hydrophobicity, via mutation or ligand binding, at APPC99 -ECD attenuates substrate-driven product release and rescues the effects of Alzheimer's disease-associated pathogenic \u03b3-secretase and APP variants on A\u03b2 length. In addition, our study reveals that APPC99 -ECD facilitates the paradoxical production of longer A\u03b2s caused by some \u03b3-secretase inhibitors, which act as high-affinity competitors of the substrate. These findings assign a pivotal role to the substrate ECD in the sequential proteolysis by \u03b3-secretases and suggest it as a sweet\u00a0spot for the potential design of APP-targeting compounds selectively promoting its processing by these enzymes.",

We compared the oral microbiomes of patients with or without AD to evaluate the association between oral microbes and AD in periodontitis. Periodontitis patients with AD (n\u2009=\u200915) and cognitively unimpaired periodontitis patients (CU) (n\u2009=\u200914) were recruited for this study. Each patient underwent an oral examination and neuropsychological evaluation. Buccal, supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were collected, and microbiomes were analysed by next-generation sequencing. Alpha diversity, beta diversity, linear discriminant analysis effect size, analysis of variance-like differential expression analysis and network analysis were used to compare group oral microbiomes. All 29 participants had moderate to severe periodontitis. Group buccal and supragingival samples were indistinguishable, but subgingival samples demonstrated significant alpha and beta diversity differences. Differential analysis showed subgingival samples of the AD group had higher prevalence of Atopobium rimae, Dialister pneumosintes, Olsenella sp. HMT 807, Saccharibacteria (TM7) sp. HMT 348 and several species of Prevotella than the CU group. Furthermore, subgingival microbiome network analysis revealed a distinct, closely connected network in the AD group comprised of various Prevotella spp. and several anaerobic bacteria. A unique microbial composition was discovered in the subgingival region in the AD group. Specifically, potential periodontal pathogens were found to be more prevalent in the subgingival plaque samples of the AD group. These bacteria may possess a potential to worsen periodontitis and other systemic diseases.

        "AbstractText": "Tau tubulin kinase-1 (TTBK1), a neuron-specific tau kinase, is highly expressed in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal regions, where early tau pathology evolves in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The protein expression level of TTBK1 is elevated in the cortex brain tissues with AD patients compared to the control subjects. We therefore hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) based targeting Ttbk1 could prevent the accumulation of phosphorylated tau, thereby delaying the development of tau pathology in AD. Here we show that in vivo administration of ASO targeting mouse Ttbk1 (ASO-Ttbk1) specifically suppressed the expression of Ttbk1 without affecting Ttbk2 expression in the temporal cortex of PS19 tau transgenic mice. Central administration of ASO-Ttbk1 in PS19 mice significantly reduced the expression level of representative phosphor-tau epitopes relevant to AD at 8\u00a0weeks post-dose, including pT231, pT181, and pS396 in the sarkosyl soluble and insoluble fractions isolated from hippocampal tissues as determined by ELISA and pS422 in soluble fractions as determined by western blotting. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that ASO-Ttbk1 significantly reduced pS422 phosphorylated tau intensity in mossy fibers region of the dentate gyrus in PS19 mice. RNA-sequence analysis of the temporal cortex tissue revealed significant enrichment of interferon-gamma and complement pathways and increased expression of antigen presenting molecules (Cd86, Cd74, and H2-Aa) in PS19 mice treated with ASO-Ttbk1, suggesting its potential effect on microglial phenotype although neurotoxic effect was absent. These data suggest that TTBK1 is an attractive therapeutic target to suppress TTBK1 without compromising TTBK2 expression and pathological tau phosphorylation in the early stages of AD.",

We conducted this two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to comprehensively investigate associations of blood lipids with psychiatric disorders. Univariable and multivariable models were established for MR analyses. Inverse variance-weighted (IVW) MR was employed as the main approach; weighted median and MR-Egger were used as sensitivity analysis methods. The possibility of violating MR assumptions was evaluated utilizing several sensitivity analyses, including heterogeneity statistics, horizontal pleiotropy statistics, single SNP analysis, leave-one-out analysis and MR-PRESSO analysis. As instrumental variables, we screened 362 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) related to blood lipids from a recent genome-wide association study involving 76,627 individuals of European ancestry, with a genome-wide significance level of p\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-\u20098.

Recently, the involvement of RIPK1 in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported; RIPK1 is involved in microglia's phenotypic transition to their dysfunctional states, and it is highly expressed in the neurons and microglia in the postmortem brains in AD patients. They prompt neurodegeneration leading to accumulations of pathological proteins in AD. Therefore, regulation of RIPK1 could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD, and in vivo imaging of RIPK1 may become a useful modality in studies of drug discovery and pathophysiology of AD. The purpose of this study was to develop a suitable radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of RIPK1. (S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one (GSK'963) has a high affinity, selectivity for RIPK1, and favorable physiochemical properties based on its chemical structure. In this study, since 11C-labeling (half-life: 20.4 min) GSK'963 retaining its structure requiring the Grignard reaction of tert-butylmagnesium halides and [11C]carbon dioxide was anticipated to give a low yield, we decided instead to 11C-label a GSK'963 analog ((S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-(m-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one, GG502), which has a high RIPK1 inhibitory activity equivalent to that of the original compound GSK'963. Thus, we successfully 11C-labeled GG502 using a Pd-mediated cross-coupling reaction in favorable yields (3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9%) and radiochemical purities (>\u200996%), and molar activity (47-115 GBq/\u03bcmol). On autoradiography, radioactivity accumulation was observed for [11C]GG502 and decreased by non-radioactive GG502 in the mouse spleen and human brain, indicating the possibility of specific binding of this ligand to RIPK1. On brain PET imaging in a rhesus monkey, [11C]GG502 showed a good brain permeability (peak standardized uptake value (SUV)\u2009~3.0), although there was no clear evidence of specific binding of [11C]GG502. On brain PET imaging in acute inflammation model rats, [11C]GG502 also showed a good brain permeability, and no significant increased uptake was observed in the lipopolysaccharide-treated side of striatum. On metabolite analysis in rats at 30 min after administration of [11C]GG502,\u2009~55% and\u2009~10% of radioactivity was from unmetabolized [11C]GG502 in the brain and the plasma, respectively. We synthesized and evaluated a 11C-labeled PET ligand based on the methylated analog of GSK'963 for imaging of RIPK1 in the brain. Although in autoradiography of the resulting [11C]GG502 indicated the possibility of specific binding, the actual PET imaging failed to detect any evidence of specific binding to RIPK1 despite its good brain permeability. Further development of radioligands with a higher binding affinity for RIPK1 in vivo and more stable metabolite profiles compared with the current compound may be required.",

In mice, we previously showed that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a gonadotropin that rises in post-menopausal females, activates its receptor FSHR in the hippocampus, to drive AD-like pathology and cognitive impairment. Here we show in mice that ApoE4 and FSH jointly trigger AD-like pathogenesis by activating C/EBP\u03b2/\u03b4-secretase signaling. ApoE4 and FSH additively activate C/EBP\u03b2/\u03b4-secretase pathway that mediates APP and Tau proteolytic fragmentation, stimulating A\u03b2 and neurofibrillary tangles.

This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), threonine 217 (p-tau217) and threonine 231 (p-tau231) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. All p-tau isoforms increase as a function of A\u03b2-accumulation and discriminate healthy individuals from those at preclinical AD stages with high accuracy. P-tau231 increases earliest, followed by p-tau181 and p-tau217. In advanced stages, all p-tau isoforms are associated with the clinical classification of AD and increase with disease severity, with the greatest increase seen for p-tau217. This is also reflected by a better correlation of p-tau217 with A\u03b2 scans, whereas both, p-tau217 and p-tau181 correlated equally with tau scans. However, at the very advanced stages, p-tau181 begins to plateau, which may mirror the trajectory of the A\u03b2 pathology and indicate an association with a more intermediate risk of AD. Across the AD continuum, the incremental increase in all biomarkers is associated with structural changes in widespread brain regions and underlying cognitive decline. Furthermore, all isoforms differentiate AD from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, making them specific for AD. Incorporating p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 in clinical use requires further studies to examine ideal cut-points and harmonize assays.",

However, the association between catheter ablation in atrial fibrillation (CA) patients and risk of dementia is not well established with conflicting results to date. We aimed to evaluate the association between CA patients and the risk of Dementia. We performed a systematic literature search using the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane libraries for relevant articles from inception until 10th May 2023. Hazard ratios (HR) were pooled using a random-effect model, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 5 studies with 125649 patients (30192 in the CA group and 95457 in the non-CA group) were included. The mean age of patients among CA and non-CA groups was comparable (58.7 vs. 58.18). The most common comorbidity among CA and non-CA groups was hypertension (18.49% vs. 81.51%) respectively. Pooled analysis of primary outcome showed that CA was associated with significant reduction in the risk of Dementia (HR, 0.63(95%CI: 0.52-0.77), P<0.001). Similarly, pooled analysis of secondary outcomes showed that the patients with CA had a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR, 0.78(95%CI: 0.66-0.92), P<0.001) compared with the non-CA group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of vascular dementia (HR, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.38-1.06), P=0.08) between both groups of patients. Our study suggested that catheter ablation reduced the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease compared to the non-ablation group of patients.",

        "AbstractText": "The aberrant accumulation of tau protein is implicated as a pathogenic factor in many neurodegenerative diseases. Tau seeding may underlie its predictable spread in these diseases. Molecular chaperones can modulate tau pathology, but their effects have mainly been studied in isolation. This study employed a semi-high throughput assay to identify molecular chaperones influencing tau seeding using Tau RD P301S FRET Biosensor cells, which express a portion of tau containing the frontotemporal dementia-related P301S tau mutation fused to a FRET biosensor. Approximately fifty chaperones from five major families were screened using live cell imaging to monitor FRET-positive tau seeding. Among the tested chaperones, five exhibited significant effects on tau in the primary screen. Notably, three of these were from the DnaJ family. In subsequent studies, overexpression of DnaJA2, DnaJB1, and DnaJB6b resulted in significant reductions in tau levels. Knockdown experiments by shRNA revealed an inverse correlation between DnaJB1 and DnaJB6b with tau levels. DnaJB6b overexpression, specifically, reduced total tau levels in a cellular model with a pre-existing pool of tau, partially through enhanced proteasomal degradation. Further, DnaJB6b interacted with tau complexes. These findings highlight the potent chaperone activity within the DnaJ family, particularly DnaJB6b, towards tau.",

For this purpose, in-vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory assays and antioxidant studies were conducted, whereas in-vivo studies involved different behavioral animal models tests such as elevated plus maze (EPM), morris water maze (MWM) and paddling Y-maze test. Results of the in-vitro analysis showed IC50 values of 95\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for AChE and 110\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for BChE as compared to the standard drug donepezil (IC50: 95 & 85\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively).

The compound [18F]15, which had two ethoxy units, showed high affinity for recombinant K18-Tau aggregates (Ki = 41.48 nM) and the highest selectivity versus A\u03b21-42 aggregates (8.83-fold). In vitro autoradiography and fluorescent staining profiles further validated the binding of [18F]15 or 15 toward NFTs in brain sections from AD patients and Tau-transgenic mice. In normal ICR mice, [18F]15 exhibited an ideal initial brain uptake (11.21% ID/g at 2 min) and moderate washout ratio (2.29), and micro-PET studies in rats confirmed its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier with the peak SUV value of 1.94 in the cortex.

We aimed to investigate associations between metabolites of the kynurenine pathway at baseline and post-stroke cognitive functioning over time. Baseline plasma kynurenines were quantified in 198 stroke patients aged 65.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.8\u00a0years, 138 (69.7%) men, who were followed up over a period of three years after stroke. Baseline and longitudinal associations of kynurenines with PSCI and cognitive domain scores were investigated using linear mixed models, adjusted for several confounders. No evidence of associations between kynurenines and odds of PSCI were found. However, considering individual cognitive domains, higher plasma levels of anthranilic acid (AA) were associated with better episodic memory at baseline (\u03b2 per SD 0.16 [0.05, 0.28]). Additionally, a linear-quadratic association was found for the kynurenic acid/ quinolinic acid ratio (KA/QA), a neuroprotective index, with episodic memory (Wald \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a08.27, p\u00a0=\u00a0.016).

Aluminum is a neurotoxin inducer for cognitive impairments associated with AD. The treatment approaches for AD are unsatisfactory. Boswellia papyrifera and Syzygium aromaticum are known for their pharmacological assets, including antioxidant activity. Therefore, the current study explored the possible mitigating effects of a combination of Boswellia papyrifera and Syzygium aromaticum against aluminum chloride (AlCl3) induced AD. The AD model was established using AlCl3 (100 mg/kg), and the rats were orally administrated with Boswellia papyrifera or Syzygium aromaticum or a combination of them daily for 8 weeks. The Y-maze test was used to test cognition in the rats, while acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and oxidative stress markers were estimated in homogenates of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Also, the histopathological examination of the cortex and hippocampus were investigated. The results revealed that administration of either B. papyrifera or S. aromaticum extracts significantly improved the cognitive functions of AD rats, enhanced AChE levels, increased oxidative enzymes levels, including SOD and GSH, and reduced MDA levels in homogenates of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and confirmed by improvement in histological examination. However, using a combination therapy gave better results compared to a single treatment. In conclusion, the present study provided primary evidence for using a combination of B. papyrifera and S. aromaticum to treat cognitive dysfunction associated with AlCl3 Induced AD by improving the AChE levels and modulating oxidative stress in the brain.",

The current study attempted to explore the effects of total flavonoids of C. songaricum (CS) on AD model by focusing on changes in BDNF/TrkB axis. AD model was induced in rats via transcranial injection of A\u03b2 1-42 and AD symptoms treated with CS of three doses. Donepezil was used as the positive control. Changes in rat memory and learning abilities, brain histological, apoptosis, production of neurotransmitters, BDNF/TrkB axis, and apoptosis-related markers were measured. The injection of A\u03b2 1-42 induced cognitive dysfunction in AD rats. The integrity of brain tissue structure was destructed and apoptosis was induced in AD rats, in which was found the increased production of AChE and A\u03b2 1-42 , and decreased production of ChAT, ACH. At the molecular level, the expression of BDNF, TrkB, and Bcl-2 was suppressed, while the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 was induced. After the administration of CS, the memory and learning abilities of rats were improved, the production of neurotransmitter was restored, ordered arrangement of pyramidal cells was retained, and neuron apoptosis was inhibited. The attenuation of A\u03b2 1-42 -indcued impairments was associated with the activation of BDNF/TrkB axis and blockade of apoptosis-related pathways.

Trigonelline, a naturally occurring alkaloid found in various plants, has emerged as a potential treatment option. It has also been reported that trigonelline is involved in several pathways like; Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant, Inflammatory, Neuroprotection and Neurotrophic, Mitochondrial Function and Energy Metabolism. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of trigonelline for diverse neurological disorders using a molecular docking approach. Molecular docking simulations were performed to predict the binding affinity and interaction between trigonelline and target proteins implicated in neurological disorders. The structural requirements for effective binding were also explored. The molecular docking results revealed strong binding interactions and favorable binding affinities between trigonelline and the target proteins involved in diverse neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and depression etc. The predicted binding modes provided insights into the key molecular interactions governing the ligand-protein complexes. The findings suggest that trigonelline holds promise as a therapeutic approach for several neurological disorders. The molecular docking approach employed in this study provides a valuable tool for rational drug design and optimization of trigonelline-based compounds.

        "AbstractText": "Lymphatic system defects are involved in a wide range of diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Fluid return through the lymphatic vascular system is primarily provided by contractions of muscle cells in the walls of lymphatic vessels, which are in turn driven by electrochemical oscillations that cause rhythmic action potentials and associated surges in intracellular calcium ion concentration. There is an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms involved in these repeated events, restricting the development of pharmacological treatments for dysfunction. Previously, we proposed a model where autonomous oscillations in the membrane potential (M-clock) drove passive oscillations in the calcium concentration (C-clock). In this paper, to model more accurately what is known about the underlying physiology, we extend this model to the case where the M-clock and the C-clock oscillators are both active but coupled together, thus both driving the action potentials. This extension results from modifications to the model's description of the IP3 receptor, a key C-clock mechanism. The synchronised dual-driving clock behaviour enables the model to match IP3 receptor knock-out data, thus resolving an issue with previous models. We also use phase-plane analysis to explain the mechanisms of coupling of the dual clocks. The model has the potential to help determine mechanisms and find targets for pharmacological treatment of some causes of lymphoedema.",

Using transgenic AD mice combined with in\u00a0vivo brain microdialysis and primary neurons under oligomeric A\u03b2-evoked neuronal hyperexcitability, the acute effects of PER on A\u03b2 metabolism were investigated. A single oral administration of PER rapidly decreased ISF A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels in the hippocampus of J20, APP transgenic mice, without affecting the A\u03b240 /A\u03b242 ratio; 5\u2009mg/kg PER resulted in declines of 20% and 31%, respectively. Moreover, PER-treated J20 manifested a marked decrease in hippocampal APP \u03b2CTF levels with increased FL-APP levels. Consistently, acute treatment of PER reduced sAPP\u03b2 levels, a direct byproduct of \u03b2-cleavage of APP, released to the medium in primary neuronal cultures under oligomeric A\u03b2-induced neuronal hyperexcitability. To further evaluate the effect of PER on ISF A\u03b2 clearance, a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor was administered to J20 1\u2009h after PER treatment. PER did not influence the elimination of ISF A\u03b2, indicating that the acute effect of PER is predominantly on A\u03b2 production.

Its high socio-economic impact and difficulties in diagnosis and treatment are of increasing concern to an aging world population. In recent years, the study of the relationship between gut microbiota and different neurocognitive disorders has gained a considerable interest. Several studies have reported associations between gut microbiota dysbiosis and some types of dementia. Probiotics have been suggested to restore dysbiosis and to improve neurocognitive symptomatology in these dementias. Based on these previous findings, the available scientific evidence on the gut microbiota in humans affected by the most prevalent dementias, as well as the probiotic trials conducted in these patients in recent years, have been here reviewed. Decreased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and other bacterial metabolites appear to play a major role in the onset of neurocognitive symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD). Increased abundance of proinflammatory taxa could be closely related to the more severe clinical symptoms in both, as well as in Lewy Bodies dementia. Important lack of information was noted in Frontotemporal dementia behavioral variant. Moreover, geographical differences in the composition of the gut microbiota have been reported in AD. Some potential beneficial effects of probiotics in AD and PDD have been reported. However, due to the controversial results further investigations are clearly necessary.",

PD is the second most ubiquitous neurological disorder after Alzheimer's disease, characterized by the depletion of dopamine in the central nervous system due to the impairment of dopaminergic neurons, leading to involuntary movements or dyskinesia. The current standard of care for PD is Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, yet the chronic use of this agent can exacerbate motor symptoms. Recent studies have investigated the effects of combining A2AR antagonist and 5-HT1A agonist on dyskinesia and motor complications in animal models of PD. It has been proved that the drug combination has significantly improved involuntary movements while maintaining motor activity, highlighting as a result new lines of therapy for PD treatments, through the regulation of both receptors. Using a combination of ligand-based pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulation, this study intends on identifying potential dual-target compounds from IBScreen. Results showed that the selected models displayed good enrichment metrics with a near perfect receiver operator characteristic (ROC) and Area under the accumulation curve (AUAC) values, signifying that the models are both specific and sensitive. Molecular docking and ADMET analysis revealed that STOCK2N-00171 could be potentially active against A2AR and 5-HT1A. Post-MD analysis confirmed that the ligand exhibits a stable behavior throughout the simulation while maintaining crucial interactions. These results imply that STOCK2N-00171 can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel and effective dual-acting ligands targeting A2AR and 5-HT1A.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "AbstractText": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly escalated into a global pandemic that primarily affects older and immunocompromised individuals due to underlying clinical conditions and suppressed immune responses. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients exhibit a spectrum of neurological symptoms, indicating that COVID-19 can affect the brain in a variety of manners. Many studies, past and recent, suggest a connection between viral infections and an increased risk of neurodegeneration, raising concerns about the neurological effects of COVID-19 and the possibility that it may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset or worsen already existing AD pathology through inflammatory processes given that both COVID-19 and AD share pathological features and risk factors. This leads us to question whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for AD and how these two conditions might influence each other. Considering the extensive reach of the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating impact of the ongoing AD pandemic, their combined effects could have significant public health consequences worldwide.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Principles of Design of Clinical Trials for Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease and Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline in the ACH2.0 Perspective: Potential Outcomes, Challenges, and Solutions.",
        "AbstractText": "With the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis (ACH) largely discredited, the ACH2.0 theory of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently introduced. Within the framework of the ACH2.0, AD is triggered by amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP)-derived intraneuronal A\u03b2 (iA\u03b2) and is driven by iA\u03b2 produced in the A\u03b2PP-independent pathway and retained intraneuronally. In this paradigm, the depletion of extracellular A\u03b2 or suppression of A\u03b2 production by A\u03b2PP proteolysis, the two sources of A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2, would be futile in symptomatic AD, due to its reliance on iA\u03b2 generated independently of A\u03b2PP, but effective in preventing AD and treating Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline (AACD) driven, in the ACH2.0 framework, by A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2. The observed effect of lecanemab and donanemab, interpreted in the ACH2.0 perspective, supports this notion and mandates AD-preventive clinical trials. Such trials are currently in progress. They are likely, however, to fail or to yield deceptive results if conducted conventionally. The present study considers concepts of design of clinical trials of lecanemab, donanemab, or any other drug, targeting the influx of A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2, in prevention of AD and treatment of AACD. It analyzes possible outcomes and explains why selection of high-risk asymptomatic participants seems reasonable but is not. It argues that outcomes of such AD preventive trials could be grossly misleading, discusses inevitable potential problems, and proposes feasible solutions. It advocates the initial evaluation of this type of drugs in clinical trials for treatment of AACD. Whereas AD protective trials of these drugs are potentially of an impractical length, AACD clinical trials are expected to yield unequivocal results within a relatively short duration. Moreover, success of the latter, in addition to its intrinsic value, would constitute a proof of concept for the former. Furthermore, this study introduces concepts of the active versus passive iA\u03b2 depletion, contends that targeted degradation of iA\u03b2 is the best therapeutic strategy for both prevention and treatment of AD and AACD, proposes potential iA\u03b2-degrading drugs, and describes their feasible and unambiguous evaluation in clinical trials.",

Transgenic mice displayed lower BDNF and IRS2, equal IRS1, and higher TNF\u03b1 expression compared to wild-type mice. Late ABA treatment could rescue TNF\u03b1 and increased IRS1/2 expression.

To determine effects of global amyloid load as well as hippocampus and basal forebrain volumes on longitudinal rates and practice effects from repeated testing of domain specific cognitive change in the AD spectrum, considering non-linear effects and heterogeneity across cohorts. We included 1,514 cases from three cohorts, ADNI, AIBL, and DELCODE, spanning the range from cognitively normal people to people with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used generalized Bayesian mixed effects analysis of linear and polynomial models of amyloid and volume effects in time. Robustness of effects across cohorts was determined using Bayesian random effects meta-analysis. We found a consistent effect of amyloid and hippocampus volume, but not of basal forebrain volume, on rates of memory change across the three cohorts in the meta-analysis. Effects for amyloid and volumetric markers on executive function were more heterogeneous. We found practice effects in memory and executive performance in amyloid negative cognitively normal controls and MCI cases, but only to a smaller degree in amyloid positive controls and not at all in amyloid positive MCI cases. We found heterogeneity between cohorts, particularly in effects on executive functions. Initial increases in cognitive performance in amyloid negative, but not in amyloid positive MCI cases and controls may reflect practice effects from repeated testing that are lost with higher levels of cerebral amyloid.",

We previously reported spatial memory impairment in TgF344-AD rats, yet the underlying mechanism remained unknown. We, therefore, set out to determine if spatial memory impairment in TgF344-AD rats is attributed to spatial disorientation. Also, we aimed to investigate whether TgF344-AD rats exhibit signs of asymmetry in hemispheric neurodegeneration, similar to what is reported in spatially disoriented AD patients. Finally, we sought to examine how spatial disorientation correlates with working memory performance. TgF344-AD rats were divided into two groups balanced by sex and genotype. The first group underwent the delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task for the assessment of spatial orientation and working memory, while the second group underwent positron emission tomography (PET) for the assessment of glucose metabolism and microglial activity as in-vivo markers of neurodegeneration. Rats were 13 months old during DMS training and 14-16 months old during DMS testing and PET. In the DMS task, TgF344-AD rats were more likely than their wild-type littermates to display strong preference for one of the two levers, preventing working memory testing. Rats without lever-preference showed similar working memory, regardless of their genotype. PET revealed hemispherically asymmetric clusters of increased microglial activity and altered glucose metabolism in TgF344-AD rats. TgF344-AD rats display spatial disorientation and hemispherically asymmetrical neurodegeneration, suggesting a potential causal relationship consistent with past clinical research. In rats with preserved spatial orientation, working memory remains intact.",

        "AbstractText": "While Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is associated with altered brain structure, it is not clear whether gene expression changes mirror the onset and evolution of pathology in distinct brain regions. Deciphering the mechanisms which cause the differential manifestation of the disease across different regions has the potential to help early diagnosis. We aimed to identify common and unique endotypes and their regulation in tangle-free neurons in sporadic AD (SAD) across six brain regions: entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus (HC), medial temporal gyrus (MTG), posterior cingulate (PC), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and visual cortex (VCX). To decipher the states of tangle-free neurons across different brain regions in human subjects afflicted with AD, we performed analysis of the neural transcriptome. We explored changes in differential gene expression, functional and transcription factor target enrichment, and co-expression gene module detection analysis to discern disease-state transcriptomic variances and characterize endotypes. Additionally, we compared our results to tangled AD neuron microarray-based study and the Allen Brain Atlas. We identified impaired neuron function in EC, MTG, PC, and VCX resulting from REST activation and reversal of mature neurons to a precursor-like state in EC, MTG, and SFG linked to SOX2 activation. Additionally, decreased neuron function and increased dedifferentiation were linked to the activation of SUZ12. Energetic deficit connected to NRF1 inactivation was found in HC, PC, and VCX. Our findings suggest that SAD manifestation varies in scale and severity in different brain regions. We identify endotypes, such as energetic shortfalls, impaired neuronal function, and dedifferentiation.",

We searched electronic databases for studies reporting brief (\u226420 minutes) cognitive test's sensitivity and specificity as part of dementia diagnosis for Chinese-speaking populations in clinical settings. We assessed quality using Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM) criteria and translation and cultural adaptation using the Manchester Translation Reporting Questionnaire (MTRQ), and Manchester Cultural Adaptation Reporting Questionnaire (MCAR). We assessed heterogeneity and combined sensitivity in meta-analyses. 38 studies met inclusion criteria and 22 were included in meta-analyses. None met the highest CEBM criteria. Five studies met the highest criteria of MTRQ and MCAR. In meta-analyses of studies with acceptable heterogeneity (I2\u200a< \u200a75%), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised &III (ACE-R & ACE-III) had the best sensitivity and specificity; specifically, for dementia (93.5% & 85.6%) and mild cognitive impairment (81.4% & 76.7%).

Although driving has been shown to be associated with traditional imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, it is possible that some biomarkers have stronger associations with specific aspects of driving behavior. Furthermore, associations between newer plasma biomarkers and driving behaviors are unknown. This study assessed the extent to which individual plasma, imaging, and CSF biomarkers are related to specific driving behaviors and cognitive functions among cognitively normal older adults. We analyzed naturalistic driving behavior from cognitively healthy older drivers (N\u200a=\u200a167, 47% female, mean age\u200a=\u200a73.3 years). All participants had driving, clinical, and demographic data and completed biomarker testing, including imaging, CSF, and/or plasma, within two years of study commencement. AD biomarkers were associated with different characteristics of driving and cognitive functioning within the same individuals. Elevated levels of plasma A\u03b240 were associated with more speeding incidents, higher levels of CSF tau were related to shorter duration of trips, and higher CSF neurofilament light chain values were associated with traveling shorter distances, smaller radius of gyration, and fewer trips at night. We demonstrated that plasma, like CSF and imaging biomarkers, were helpful in predicting everyday driving behaviors. These findings suggest that different biomarkers offer complementary information with respect to driving behaviors. These distinct relationships may help in understanding how different biological changes that occur during the preclinical stage of AD can impact various sensorimotor and cognitive processes.",

While a normal decline in verbal fluency occurs in late adulthood, significant impairments may indicate brain injury or diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Normative data is essential to identify when test performance falls below expected levels based on age, gender, and education level. This study aimed to establish normative performance data on single-letter COWAT for older community-dwelling adults. Over 19,000 healthy men and women, without a diagnosis of dementia or a Modified Mini-Mental State Examination score below 77/100, were recruited for the ASPREE trial. Neuropsychological assessments, including the COWAT with letter F, were administered at study entry. Median participant age was 75 years (range 65-98), with 56.5% being women. The majority of participants had 9-11 years of education in Australia and over 12 years in the U.S. The COWAT performance varied across ethno-racial groups and normative data were thus presented separately for 16,335 white Australians, 1,084 white Americans, 896 African-Americans, and 316 Hispanic/Latinos. Women generally outperformed men in the COWAT, except for Hispanic/Latinos. Higher education levels consistently correlated with better COWAT performance across all groups, while the negative association with age was weaker. This study provides comprehensive normative data for the COWAT stratified by ethno-racial groups in Australia and the U.S., considering age, gender, and education level.

In addition to human embryonic stem cells, since the successes of Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006, there has been an increased focus on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS cells). These cells avoid ethically challenging questions about the moral status of human embryos, but there are numerous problems, such as high production costs, side effects from the reprogramming process, or a potentially new moral status.

Among the low SE group, increased AD risks were found in NHPIs compared to Asians for all conditions selected and compared to whites for HF, IHD, and stroke. Interestingly, these observations were found reversed in the higher SE group, showing reduced AD risks for NHPIs compared to whites for AF, HF, and IHD, and to Asians for HF and IHD.

To construct the neuronal damage model, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with A\u03b21-42 . By qRT-PCR, we found that miR-6076 is significantly upregulated in A\u03b21-42 -treated SH-SY5Y cells. After miR-6076 inhibition, p-Tau and apoptosis levels were downregulated, and cell viability was increased. Through online bioinformatics analysis, we found that B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) was a directly target of miR-6076 via dual-luciferase reporter assay. BCL6 overexpression mediated the decrease in elevated p-Tau levels and increased viability in SH-SY5Y cells following A\u03b21-42 treatment. Our results suggest that down-regulation of miR-6076 could attenuate A\u03b21-42 -induced neuronal damage by targeting BCL6, which provided a possible target to pursue for prevention and treatment of A\u03b2-induced neuronal damage in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder leading to a decline in cognitive function and mental health. Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of Alzheimer's patients and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of Alzheimer's symptoms. To understand the involvement of Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from Alzheimer's patients decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that Alzheimer's symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in Alzheimer's.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaque accumulation-mediated neuronal toxicity has been suggested to cause synaptic damage and consequent degeneration of brain cells in Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the increasing prerequisite of eco-friendly nanoparticles (NPs), research investigators are utilizing green approaches for the synthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs for pharmaceutical applications. In this present study, ZnO NPs were synthesized from Acanthus ilicifolius to assess the neuroprotective properties in the AD model of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strains CL2006 and CL4176 expressing A\u03b2 aggregation. Our findings revealed that the therapeutic effect of green-synthesized ZnO NPs is associated with antioxidant activity. We also found that ZnO NPs significantly enhance the C. elegan's lifespan, locomotion, pharyngeal pumping, chemotaxis behavior also diminish the ROS deposition and intracellular productionMoreover, thioflavin T staining demonstrated that ZnO NPs substantially attenuated the A\u03b2 deposition in the C. elegans strain as compared to untreated worms. With their antioxidant properties, the greenly synthesized ZnO NPs had a significant neuroprotective efficiency on A\u03b2-induced toxicity by reducing A\u03b2 aggregation and specifically reducing the progression of paralysis in the C. elegans AD model. Our findings suggested that the biosynthesized ZnO NPs could be thought-provoking candidates for age-associated neurodegenerative disorders accompanied by oxidative stress.",

        "AbstractText": "Signatures of a type-I interferon (IFN-I) response are observed in the post mortem brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, the effect of the IFN-I response on pathological tau accumulation remains unclear. We examined the effects of IFN-I signaling in primary neural culture models of seeded tau aggregation and P301S-tau transgenic mouse models in the context of genetic deletion of the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR). Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C), a synthetic analog of viral nucleic acids, evoked a potent cytokine response that enhanced seeded aggregation of tau in an IFN-I-dependent manner. IFN-I-induced vulnerability could be pharmacologically prevented and was intrinsic to neurons. Aged P301S-tau mice lacking Ifnar1 had significantly reduced tau pathology compared to mice with intact IFN signaling. We identify a critical role for IFN-I in potentiating tau aggregation. IFN-I is therefore identified as a potential therapeutic target in AD and other tauopathies. Type-I IFN (IFN-I) promotes seeded tau aggregation in neural cultures. IFNAR inhibition prevents IFN-I driven sensitivity to tau aggregation. IFN-I driven vulnerability is intrinsic to neurons. Tau pathology is significantly reduced in aged P301S-tau mice lacking IFNAR.",

        "AbstractText": "Current treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely failed to yield significant therapeutic benefits. Novel approaches are desperately needed to help address this immense public health issue. Data suggests that early intervention at the first stages of mild cognitive impairment may have a greater chance for success. The calcineurin (CN)-Pin1 signaling cascade can be selectively targeted with tacrolimus (FK506), a highly specific, FDA-approved CN inhibitor used safely for\u2009>\u200920\u00a0years in solid organ transplant recipients. AD prevalence was significantly reduced in solid organ recipients treated with FK506. Time release pellets were used to deliver constant FK506 dosage to APP/PS1 mice without deleterious manipulation or handling. Immunofluorescence, histology, molecular biology, and behavior were used to evaluate changes in AD pathology. FK506 can be safely and consistently delivered into juvenile APP/PS1 mice via time-release pellets to levels roughly seen in transplant patients, leading to the normalization of CN activity and reduction or elimination of AD pathologies including synapse loss, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. Pin1 activity and function were rescued despite the continuing presence of high levels of transgenic A\u03b242. Indicators of neuroinflammation including Iba1 positivity and IL-6 production were also reduced to normal levels. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained during treatment or splenocytes isolated at euthanasia activated normally after mitogens. Low-dose, constant FK506 can normalize CNS CN and Pin1 activity, suppress neuroinflammation, and attenuate AD-associated pathology without blocking peripheral IL-2 responses making repurposed FK506 a viable option for early, therapeutic intervention in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease involves accumulating amyloid (A) and tau (T) pathology, and progressive neurodegeneration (N), leading to the development of the AD clinical syndrome. While several markers of N have been proposed, efforts to define normal vs. abnormal neurodegeneration based on neuroimaging have been limited. Sensitive markers that may account for or predict cognitive dysfunction for individuals in early disease stages are critical. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009296) defined on A and T status and spanning the AD-clinical continuum underwent multi-shell diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to generate Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) metrics, which were tested as markers of N. To better define N, we developed age- and sex-adjusted robust z-score values to quantify normal and AD-associated (abnormal) neurodegeneration in both cortical gray matter and subcortical white matter regions of interest. We used general logistic regression with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analysis to test whether NODDI metrics improved diagnostic accuracy compared to models that only relied on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A and T status (alone and in combination). Using internal robust norms, we found that NODDI metrics correlate with worsening cognitive status and that NODDI captures early, AD neurodegenerative pathology in the gray matter of cognitively unimpaired, but A/T biomarker-positive, individuals. NODDI metrics utilized together with A and T status improved diagnostic prediction accuracy of AD clinical status, compared with models using CSF A and T status alone. Using a robust norms approach, we show that abnormal AD-related neurodegeneration can be detected among cognitively unimpaired individuals. Metrics derived from diffusion-weighted imaging are potential sensitive markers of N and could be considered for trial enrichment and as outcomes in clinical trials. However, given the small sample sizes, the exploratory nature of the work must be acknowledged.",

Epistasis has been proposed as a major contributor to this 'missing heritability', however, many current methods are limited to only modelling additive effects. We use VariantSpark, a machine learning approach to GWAS, and BitEpi, a tool for epistasis detection, to identify AD associated variants and interactions across two independent cohorts, ADNI and UK Biobank. By incorporating significant epistatic interactions, we captured 10.41% more phenotypic variance than logistic regression (LR). We validate the well-established AD loci, APOE, and identify two novel genome-wide significant AD associated loci in both cohorts, SH3BP4 and SASH1, which are also in significant epistatic interactions with APOE. We show that the SH3BP4 SNP has a modulating effect on the known pathogenic APOE SNP, demonstrating a possible protective mechanism against AD. SASH1 is involved in a triplet interaction with pathogenic APOE SNP and ACOT11, where the SASH1 SNP lowered the pathogenic interaction effect between ACOT11 and APOE. Finally, we demonstrate that VariantSpark detects disease associations with 80% fewer controls than LR, unlocking discoveries in well annotated but smaller cohorts.",

A retrospective analysis was made on 48 geriatric patients with intertrochanteric fractures, who met the selection criteria and were admitted between January 2020 and December 2022. Among them, 24 cases were treated with PFBN fixation after fracture reduction (PFBN group), and 24 cases were treated with PFNA fixation (PFNA group). There was no significant difference in baseline data such as age, gender, cause of injury, side and type of fracture, time from injury to operation, and preoperative mobility score, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Alzheimer's disease degree scoring, self-care ability score, osteoporosis degree (T value), and combined medical diseases between the two groups ( P>0.05). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, number of blood transfusions, transfusion volume, length of hospital stay, occurrence of complications, weight-bearing time after operation, and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score, walking ability score, mobility score, self-care ability score were recorded and compared between the two groups. And the radiographic assessment of fracture reduction quality and postoperative stability, and fracture healing time were recorded. The operations in both groups were successfully completed. All patients were followed up 6-15 months with an average time of 9.8 months in PFBN group and 9.6 months in PFNA group. The operation time was significantly longer in PFBN group than in PFNA group ( P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in intraoperative blood loss, number of blood transfusions, transfusion volume, length of hospital stay, change in activity ability score, and change in self-care ability score between the two groups ( P>0.05). The weight-bearing time after operation was significantly shorter in PFBN group than in PFNA group ( P<0.05), and the postoperative VAS score and walking ability score were significantly better in PFBN group than in PFNA group ( P<0.05). Radiographic assessment showed no significant difference in fracture reduction scores and postoperative stability scores between the two groups ( P>0.05). All fractures healed and there was no significant difference in fracture healing time between the two groups ( P>0.05). The incidence of complications was significantly lower in PFBN group (16.7%, 4/24) than in PFNA group (45.8%, 11/24) ( P<0.05). Compared with PFNA, PFBN in the treatment of elderly intertrochanteric fractures can effectively relieve postoperative pain, shorten bed time, reduce the risk of complications, and facilitate the recovery of patients' hip joint function and walking ability. \u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u80a1\u9aa8\u8fd1\u7aef\u9632\u65cb\u9ad3\u5185\u9489\uff08proximal femoral nail antirotation\uff0cPFNA\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u80a1\u9aa8\u8fd1\u7aef\u4eff\u751f\u9ad3\u5185\u9489\uff08proximal femur bionic nail\uff0cPFBN\uff09\u6cbb\u7597\u8001\u5e74\u80a1\u9aa8\u8f6c\u5b50\u95f4\u9aa8\u6298\u7684\u7597\u6548\u3002. \u56de\u987e\u5206\u67902020\u5e741\u6708\u20142022\u5e7412\u6708\u6536\u6cbb\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\u768448\u4f8b\u8001\u5e74\u80a1\u9aa8\u8f6c\u5b50\u95f4\u9aa8\u6298\u60a3\u8005\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6599\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c24\u4f8b\u9aa8\u6298\u590d\u4f4d\u540e\u91c7\u7528PFBN\u5185\u56fa\u5b9a\uff08PFBN\u7ec4\uff09\uff0c24\u4f8b\u91c7\u7528PFNA \u5185\u56fa\u5b9a\uff08PFNA\u7ec4\uff09\u3002\u4e24\u7ec4\u60a3\u8005\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u81f4\u4f24\u539f\u56e0\u3001\u9aa8\u6298\u4fa7\u522b\u53ca\u5206\u578b\u3001\u53d7\u4f24\u81f3\u624b\u672f\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u672f\u524d\u6d3b\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u9ebb\u9189\u5e08\u534f\u4f1a\uff08ASA\uff09\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u8001\u5e74\u75f4\u5446\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\u81ea\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u9aa8\u8d28\u758f\u677e\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff08T\u503c\uff09\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u5185\u79d1\u75be\u75c5\u60c5\u51b5\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u8d44\u6599\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08 P>0.05\uff09\u3002\u8bb0\u5f55\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u7ec4\u624b\u672f\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u672f\u4e2d\u51fa\u8840\u91cf\u3001\u672f\u4e2d\u8f93\u8840\u4f8b\u6570\u53ca\u8f93\u8840\u91cf\u3001\u4f4f\u9662\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u53d1\u751f\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u672f\u540e\u60a3\u8005\u4e0b\u5730\u7ad9\u7acb\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u75bc\u75db\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u5206\uff08VAS\uff09\u3001\u884c\u8d70\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u6d3b\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\u81ea\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u590d\u67e5\u9aa8\u6298\u590d\u4f4d\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u672f\u540e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u9aa8\u6298\u6108\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u6108\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u3002. \u4e24\u7ec4\u624b\u672f\u5747\u987a\u5229\u5b8c\u6210\u4e14\u60a3\u8005\u672f\u540e\u5747\u83b7\u968f\u8bbf\uff0c\u968f\u8bbf\u65f6\u95f46\uff5e15\u4e2a\u6708\uff0cPFBN\u7ec4\u5e73\u57479.8\u4e2a\u6708\u3001PFNA\u7ec49.6\u4e2a\u6708\u3002PFBN\u7ec4\u624b\u672f\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u4e8ePFNA\u7ec4\uff08 P<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u7ec4\u672f\u4e2d\u51fa\u8840\u91cf\u3001\u8f93\u8840\u4f8b\u6570\u3001\u8f93\u8840\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u672f\u540e\u4f4f\u9662\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6d3b\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u53d8\u5316\u503c\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\u81ea\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u53d8\u5316\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08 P>0.05\uff09\u3002PFBN\u7ec4\u60a3\u8005\u672f\u540e\u4e0b\u5730\u7ad9\u7acb\u65f6\u95f4\u8f83PFNA\u7ec4\u7f29\u77ed\uff0c\u672f\u540eVAS\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u884c\u8d70\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u5747\u4f18\u4e8ePFNA\u7ec4\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08 P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u590d\u67e5\u793a\u4e24\u7ec4\u9aa8\u6298\u590d\u4f4d\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee5\u53ca\u672f\u540e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08 P>0.05\uff09\uff0c\u9aa8\u6298\u5747\u6108\u5408\u4e14\u6108\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u4ea6\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08 P>0.05\uff09\u3002PFBN\u7ec4\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0816.7%\uff0c4/24\uff09\u4f4e\u4e8ePFNA\u7ec4\uff0845.8%\uff0c11/24\uff09\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08 P<0.05\uff09\u3002. \u4e0ePFNA\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8001\u5e74\u80a1\u9aa8\u8f6c\u5b50\u95f4\u9aa8\u6298\u590d\u4f4d\u540e\u91c7\u7528PFBN\u5185\u56fa\u5b9a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u75bc\u75db\uff0c\u7f29\u77ed\u672f\u540e\u5367\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u9acb\u5173\u8282\u529f\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ca\u884c\u8d70\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6062\u590d\u3002.",

NAD+ levels decline with aging and in some age-related diseases, and reduction in NAD+ affects all the hallmarks of aging. Here, we present an overview of the discovery of NAD+, the cellular pathways of producing and consuming NAD+, and discuss how imbalances in the production rate and cellular request of NAD+ likely contribute to aging and age-related diseases including neurodegeneration. Preclinical studies have revealed great potential for NAD+ precursors in promotion of healthy aging and improvement of neurodegeneration. This has led to the initiation of several clinical trials with NAD+ precursors to treat accelerated aging, age-associated dysfunctions, and diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Literature search aimed at identifying (a) cognitive measures appropriate for patients with advanced dementia, (b) functional scales to use as a proxy for cognitive status in patients with floor effects on baseline cognitive testing, and (c) statistical approaches for defining a CAE, to develop CAEs monitoring plan specifically for the ECT-AD study. Using the Severe Impairment Battery-8 (SIB-8), baseline floor effects are defined as a score of \u22645/16. For patients without floor effects, a decline of \u22656 points is considered a CAE. For patients with floor effects, a decline of \u226530 points from baseline on the Barthel Index is considered a CAE. These values were derived using the standard deviation index (SDI) approach to measuring reliable change. The proposed plan accounts for practical and statistical challenges in detecting CAEs in patients with advanced dementia. While this protocol was developed in the context of the ECT-AD study, the general approach can potentially be applied to other interventional neuropsychiatric studies that carry the risk of CAEs in patients with advanced dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has entered a new era with the recent positive phase 3 clinical trials of the anti-A\u03b2 antibodies lecanemab and donanemab. Why did it take 30 years to achieve these successes? Developing potent therapies for reducing fibrillar amyloid was key, as was selection of patients at relatively early stages of disease. Biomarkers of the target pathologies, including amyloid and tau PET, and insights from past trials were also critical to the recent successes. Moving forward, the challenge will be to develop more efficacious therapies with greater efficiency. Novel trial designs, including combination therapies and umbrella and basket protocols, will accelerate clinical development. Better diversity and inclusivity of trial participants are needed, and blood-based biomarkers may help to improve access for medically underserved groups. Incentivizing innovation in both academia and industry through public-private partnerships, collaborative mechanisms, and the creation of new career paths will be critical to build momentum in these exciting times.",

        "AbstractText": "Many clinical studies reported the coexistence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), but the common molecular signature between AD and MS remains elusive. The purpose of our study is to explore the genetic linkage between AD and MS through bioinformatic analysis, providing new insights into the shared signatures and possible pathogenesis of two diseases. The common differential expressed genes (DEGs) were determined between AD and MS from datasets obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Further, functional and pathway enrichment analysis, PPI network construction, and identification of hub genes were carried out. The expression level of hub genes was validated in two other external AD and MS datasets. Transcription factor (TF)-gene interactions and gene-miRNA interactions were performed in NetworkAnalyst. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to evaluate the predictive value of hub genes. A total of 75 common DEGs were identified between AD and MS. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis emphasized the importance of exocytosis and synaptic vesicle cycle, respectively. Six significant hub genes, including CCL2, CD44, GFAP, NEFM, STXBP1, and TCEAL6 were identified and verified as common hub genes shared by AD and MS. FOXC1 and hsa-mir-16-5p are the most common TF and miRNA in regulating hub genes, respectively. In the ROC curve analysis, all hub genes showed good efficiency in helping distinguishing patients from controls. Our study firstly identified a common genetic signature between AD and MS, paving the road for investigating shared machanism of AD and MS.",

        "AbstractText": "We investigated the value of automated enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) quantification to distinguish chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE+) from chronic TBI patients without PTE (PTE-) in a feasibility study. Patients with and without PTE were recruited and underwent an MRI post-TBI. Multimodal auto identification of ePVS algorithm was applied to T1-weighted MRIs to segment ePVS. The total number of ePVS was calculated and corrected for white matter volume, and an asymmetry index (AI) derived. PTE was diagnosed in 7 out of the 99 participants (male=69) after a median time of less than one year since injury (range 10-22). Brain lesions were observed in all 7 PTE+ cases (unilateral=4, 57%; bilateral=3, 43%) as compared to 40 PTE- cases (total 44%; unilateral=17, 42%; bilateral=23, 58%). There was a significant difference between PTE+ (M=1.21e-4, IQR [8.89e-5]) and PTE- cases (M=2.79e-4, IQR [6.25e-5]) in total corrected numbers of ePVS in patients with unilateral lesions (p=0.024). No differences in AI, trauma severity and lesion volume were seen between groups. This study has shown that automated quantification of ePVS is feasible and provided initial evidence that individuals with PTE with unilateral lesions may have fewer ePVS compared to TBI patients without epilepsy. Further studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to determine the value of ePVS quantification as a PTE-biomarker.",

Ageing is considered to be the greatest risk factor for PD, with a complex interplay between genetics and the environment. With population ageing, the prevalence of PD is expected to escalate worldwide; thus, it is of utmost importance to reduce the burden of PD. To date, there are no therapies to cure the disease, and current treatment strategies focus on the management of symptoms. Older adults often have multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes, which further complicates the management of PD. Healthcare systems and care models necessary to address the broad needs of older PD patients are largely unavailable. In this New Horizon article, we discuss various aspects of PD from an ageing perspective, including disease management. We highlight recent advancements in PD therapies and discuss new care models with the potential to improve patient's quality of life.",

        "AbstractText": "Numerous A\u03b2 proteoforms, identified in the human brain, possess differential neurotoxic and aggregation propensities. These proteoforms contribute in unknown ways to the conformations and resultant pathogenicity of oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifestation owing to the lack of molecular-level specificity to the exact chemical composition of underlying protein products with widespread interrogating techniques, like immunoassays. We evaluated A\u03b2 proteoform flux using quantitative top-down mass spectrometry (TDMS) in a well-studied 5xFAD mouse model of age-dependent A\u03b2-amyloidosis. Though the brain-derived A\u03b2 proteoform landscape is largely occupied by A\u03b21-42, 25 different forms of A\u03b2 with differential solubility were identified. These proteoforms fall into three natural groups defined by hierarchical clustering of expression levels in the context of mouse age and proteoform solubility, with each group sharing physiochemical properties associated with either N/C-terminal truncations or both. Overall, the TDMS workflow outlined may hold tremendous potential for investigating proteoform-level relationships between insoluble fibrils and soluble A\u03b2, including low-molecular-weight oligomers hypothesized to serve as the key drivers of neurotoxicity. Similarly, the workflow may also help to validate the utility of AD-relevant animal models to recapitulate amyloidosis mechanisms or possibly explain disconnects observed in therapeutic efficacy in animal models vs humans.",

        "AbstractText": "Disparities in cancer incidence, complex care needs, and poor health outcomes are largely driven by structural inequities stemming from social determinants of health. To date, no evidence-based clinical tool has been developed to identify newly diagnosed patients at risk of poorer outcomes. Specialist cancer nurses are well-positioned to ameliorate inequity of opportunity for optimal care, treatment, and outcomes through timely screening, assessment, and intervention. We designed a nursing complexity checklist (the \"Checklist\") to support these activities, with the ultimate goal of improving equitable experiences and outcomes of care. This study aims to generate evidence regarding the clinical utility of the Checklist. The primary objectives of this study are to provide qualitative evidence regarding key aspects of the Checklist's clinical utility (appropriateness, acceptability, and practicability), informed by Smart's multidimensional model of clinical utility. Secondary objectives explore the predictive value of the Checklist and concordance between specific checklist items and patient-reported outcome measures. This prospective mixed methods case series study will recruit up to 60 newly diagnosed patients with cancer and 10 specialist nurses from a specialist cancer center. Nurses will complete the Checklist with patient participants. Within 2 weeks of Checklist completion, patients will complete 5 patient-reported outcome measures with established psychometric properties that correspond to specific checklist items and an individual semistructured interview to explore Checklist clinical utility. Interviews with nurses will occur 12 and 24 weeks after they first complete a checklist, exploring perceptions of the Checklist's clinical utility including barriers and facilitators to implementation. Data describing planned and unplanned patient service use will be collected from patient follow-up interviews at 12 weeks and the electronic medical record at 24 weeks after Checklist completion. Descriptive statistics will summarize operational, checklist, and electronic medical record data. The predictive value of the Checklist and the relationship between specific checklist items and relevant patient-reported outcome measures will be examined using descriptive statistics, contingency tables, measures of association, and plots as appropriate. Qualitative data will be analyzed using a content analysis approach. This study was approved by the institution's ethics committee. The enrollment period commenced in May 2022 and ended in November 2022. In total, 37 patients with cancer and 7 specialist cancer nurses were recruited at this time. Data collection is scheduled for completion at the end of May 2023. This study will evaluate key clinical utility dimensions of a nursing complexity checklist. It will also provide preliminary evidence on its predictive value and information to support its seamless implementation into everyday practice including, but not limited to, possible revisions to the Checklist, instructions, and training for relevant personnel. Future implementation of this Checklist may improve equity of opportunity of access to care for patients with cancer. DERR1-10.2196/48432.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Use of Immersive Virtual Reality Spaces to Engage Adolescent and Young Adult Patients With Cancer in Therapist-Guided Support Groups: Protocol for a Pre-Post Study.",
        "AbstractText": "For adolescents and young adults, a cancer diagnoses can magnify feelings of social isolation at an inherently vulnerable developmental stage. Prior studies have highlighted the importance of peer groups during cancer treatment. Support groups help foster connection and resilience, but patients find in-person participation difficult due to a variety of factors. Additionally, physical changes brought on by cancer makes these patients hesitant to meet in person. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified these difficulties. Virtual reality (VR) allows for the creation of a therapist-curated, computer-generated social space that potentially enables support groups for this population. This protocol describes a pilot study examining the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a social VR support group intervention for adolescent and young adult patients with cancer. We approached 20 participants aged 17-20 years, and 16 agreed to participate. Moreover, 1 participant dropped out due to hospitalization. Participants attended virtual, professionally facilitated support groups using Meta Quest VR headsets. The groups consisted of 4 participants and 1 facilitator, amounting to a total of 22 individual sessions. Each session lasted 45-60 minutes and took place weekly for 4-6 weeks. The primary aim of this study was to collect quantitative and qualitative data on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Feasibility was measured through session participation rates and overall retention rates. The acceptability of the intervention was explored through brief in-person interviews with participants at the end of the final intervention session. The secondary aim of this study was to collect data on the preliminary efficacy of the intervention in decreasing symptoms of participant depression and anxiety and increasing positive affect and resiliency. In total, 15 patients aged 17-20 years participated in 22 sessions between November 5, 2019, and July 8, 2021. The median age was 19 (IQR 17-20) years. Overall, 10 (62%) participants identified as male, 5 (31%) as female, and 1 (6%) as transgender female. Furthermore, 5 (31%) participants identified as Hispanic, 1 (6%) identified as non-Hispanic Asian, 3 (19%) identified as non-Hispanic Black, 6 (38%) identified as non-Hispanic White, and 1 (6%) identified as other race or ethnicity. Hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure was the most common diagnosis (8/16, 50%). The mean attendance rate was 72.8% (SD 25.7%) and retention was 86.7% (SD 0.35%). Moreover, 45% (10/22) of sessions had to be postponed by a week or more due to unexpected participant scheduling issues. The use of VR to deliver psychosocial support for adolescents and young adults with cancer may reduce common barriers associated with attending in-person peer support groups while improving quality-of-life measures. The data from this study will inform future studies focused on conducting VR support groups in other rare disease populations, including older adults with cancer. DERR1-10.2196/48761.",

This mixed methods study aims to explore patients' experiences of telehealth and their preferences regarding the use of telehealth for cancer rehabilitation to inform service development. The study was completed in 2 phases from October 2020 to November 2021. In phase 1, an anonymous survey (web- and paper-based) exploring the need, benefits, barriers, facilitators, and preferences for telehealth cancer rehabilitation was distributed to survivors of cancer in Ireland. In phase 2, survivors of cancer were invited to participate in semistructured interviews exploring their experiences of telehealth and its role in cancer rehabilitation. Interviews were conducted via telephone or video call following an interview guide informed by the results of the survey and transcribed verbatim, and reflexive thematic analysis was performed using a qualitative descriptive approach. A total of 48 valid responses were received. The respondents were at a median of 26 (range 3-256) months after diagnosis, and 23 (48%) of the 48 participants had completed treatment. Of the 48 respondents, 31 (65%) reported using telehealth since the start of the pandemic, 15 (31%) reported having experience with web-based cancer rehabilitation, and 43 (90%) reported a willingness for web-based cancer rehabilitation. A total of 26 (54%) of the 48 respondents reported that their views on telehealth had changed positively since the start of the pandemic. Semistructured interviews were held with 18 survivors of cancer. The mean age of the participants was 58.9 (SD 8.24) years, 56% (10/18) of the participants were female, and 44% (8/18) of the participants were male. Reflexive thematic analysis identified 5 key themes: telehealth improves accessibility to cancer rehabilitation for some but is a barrier for others, lived experiences of the benefits of telehealth in survivorship, the value of in-person health care, telehealth in cancer care and COVID-19 (from novelty to normality), and the future of telehealth in cancer rehabilitation. Telehealth is broadly welcomed as a mode of cancer rehabilitation for patients living with and beyond cancer in Ireland. However, issues regarding accessibility and the importance of in-person care must be acknowledged. Factors of convenience, time savings, and cost savings indicate that telehealth interventions are a desirable patient-centered method of delivering care when performed in suitable clinical contexts and with appropriate populations.",

        "AbstractText": "Many adults use e-cigarettes to help them quit cigarette smoking. However, the impact of self-selected use of e-cigarettes on cigarette smoking cessation, particularly when concurrently receiving app-based behavioral interventions, remains unexplored. This study used data from a randomized trial of 2 smartphone apps to compare 12-month cigarette smoking cessation rates between participants who used e-cigarettes on their own (ie, adopters: n=465) versus those who did not (ie, nonadopters: n=1097). The study population included all participants who did not use e-cigarettes at baseline. \"Adopters\" were those who self-reported the use of e-cigarettes at either 3- or 6-month follow-ups. \"Nonadopters\" were those who self-reported no use of e-cigarettes at either follow-up time point. The primary cessation outcome was self-reported, complete-case, 30-day point prevalence abstinence from cigarette smoking at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were missing-as-smoking and multiple imputation analyses of the primary outcome, prolonged abstinence, and cessation of all nicotine and tobacco products at 12 months. In logistic regression models, we first examined the potential interaction between e-cigarette use and treatment arm (iCanQuit vs QuitGuide) on the primary cessation outcome. Subsequently, we compared 12-month cigarette smoking cessation rates between adopters and nonadopters separately for each app. There was suggestive evidence for an interaction between e-cigarette use and treatment arm on cessation (P=.05). In the iCanQuit arm, 12-month cigarette smoking cessation rates were significantly lower among e-cigarette adopters compared with nonadopters (41/193, 21.2% vs 184/527, 34.9%; P=.003; odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.37-0.81). In contrast, in the QuitGuide arm, 12-month cigarette smoking cessation rates did not differ between adopters and nonadopters (46/246, 18.7% vs 104/522, 19.9%; P=.64; odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.62-1.35). The use of e-cigarettes while concurrently receiving an app-based smoking cessation intervention was associated with either a lower or an unimproved likelihood of quitting cigarette smoking compared to no use. Future behavioral treatments for cigarette smoking cessation should consider including information on the potential consequences of e-cigarette use.

        "AbstractText": "The potential risk and subsequent impact of serious complications after pancreatic and colorectal surgery can be significantly reduced through early recognition, correct assessment, and timely initiation of appropriate therapy. Serious gaming (SG) is an innovative teaching method that combines play with knowledge acquisition, increased concentration, and quick decision-making and could therefore be used for clinically oriented education. This study aims to develop a case-based SG platform for complication management in pancreatic and colorectal surgery, validate the application by comparing game courses of various professional groups in the health care sector, and test the acceptance of the developed platform in the context of clinical education by measuring levels of usability and applicability within the framework of a validity and usefulness analysis. In this observational trial, a novel SG for management of postoperative complications was developed and prospectively validated in a cohort of 131 human caregivers with varying experience in abdominal surgery. A total of 6 realistic patient cases were implemented, representing common complications after pancreatic and colorectal surgery. Cases were developed and illustrated using anonymized images, data, and histories of postoperative patients. In the prospective section of this study, following a brief case presentation, participants were asked to triage the virtual patient, make an initial suspected diagnosis, and design a 3-step management plan, throughout which the results of selected diagnostic and therapeutic actions were presented. Participants' proposed case management was compared to ideal case management according to clinical guidelines. Usability, applicability, validity, and acceptance of the application were assessed using the Trier Teaching Evaluation Inventory as part of a noncomparative analysis. In addition, a comparative analysis of conventional teaching and learning formats was carried out. A total of 131 cases were answered. Physicians selected more appropriate therapeutic measures than nonphysicians. In the Trier Teaching Evaluation Inventory, design, structure, relevance, timeliness, and interest promotion were predominantly rated positively. Most participants perceived the application to be superior to conventional lecture-based formats (training courses, lectures, and seminars) in terms of problem-solving skills (102/131, 77.9%), self-reflection (102/131, 77.9%), and usability and applicability (104/131, 79.4%).

Despite its clinical efficacy, many patients with cancer experience nonresponse to CAR T-cell treatment, disease relapse within months, or severe adverse events. Furthermore, CAR T-cell therapy has demonstrated minimal to no clinical efficacy in the treatment of solid tumors in clinical trials. A complex interplay between high tumor burden and the systemic and local tumor microenvironment on clinical outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy is emerging from preclinical and clinical data. The hallmarks of advanced cancers-namely, inflammation and immune dysregulation-sustain cancer progression. They negatively affect the production, expansion, antitumor activity, and persistence of CAR T-cell products. Understanding of CAR T-cell therapy, mechanisms underlying its failure, and adverse events under conditions of high tumor burden is critical for realizing the full potential of this novel treatment approach. This review focuses on linking the efficacy and safety of CAR T-cell therapy with tumor burden. Its limitations relative to high tumor burden, systemic inflammation, and immune dysregulation are discussed. Emerging clinical approaches to overcome these obstacles and more effectively incorporate this therapeutic strategy into the treatment paradigm of patients with solid malignant tumors are also described.",

Neoadjuvant therapy is highly efficacious, so this recommendation may have broad implications, but the current trends in organ preservation in the US are unknown. To describe organ preservation trends among patients with rectal cancer in the US from 2006 to 2020. This retrospective, observational case series included adults (aged \u226518 years) with rectal adenocarcinoma managed with curative intent from 2006 to 2020 in the National Cancer Database. The year of treatment was the primary exposure. The type of therapy was chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery (proctectomy, transanal local excision, no tumor resection). The timing of therapy was classified as neoadjuvant or adjuvant. The primary outcome was the absolute annual proportion of organ preservation after radical treatment, defined as chemotherapy and/or radiation without tumor resection, proctectomy, or transanal local excision. A secondary analysis examined complete pathologic responses among eligible patients. Of the 175\u202f545 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 63 (13) years, 39.7% were female, 17.4% had clinical stage I disease, 24.7% had stage IIA to IIC disease, 32.1% had stage IIIA to IIIC disease, and 25.7% had unknown stage. The absolute annual proportion of organ preservation increased by 9.8 percentage points (from 18.4% in 2006 to 28.2% in 2020; P\u2009<\u2009.001). From 2006 to 2020, the absolute rate of organ preservation increased by 13.0 percentage points for patients with stage IIA to IIC disease (19.5% to 32.5%), 12.9 percentage points for patients with stage IIIA to IIC disease (16.2% to 29.1%), and 10.1 percentage points for unknown stages (16.5% to 26.6%; all P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conversely, patients with stage I disease experienced a 6.1-percentage point absolute decline in organ preservation (from 26.4% in 2006 to 20.3% in 2020; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The annual rate of transanal local excisions decreased for all stages. In the subgroup of 80\u202f607 eligible patients, the proportion of complete pathologic responses increased from 6.5% in 2006 to 18.8% in 2020 (P\u2009<\u2009.001). This case series shows that rectal cancer is increasingly being managed medically, especially among patients whose treatment historically relied on proctectomy. Given the National Comprehensive Cancer Network endorsement of watch and wait, the increasing trends in organ preservation, and the nearly 3-fold increase in complete pathologic responses, international professional societies should urgently develop multidisciplinary core outcome sets and care quality indicators to ensure high-quality rectal cancer research and care delivery accounting for organ preservation.",

To evaluate changes in the absolute number, proportion, and cancer treatment modalities provided to patients with newly diagnosed cancer during 2020, the first year of the pandemic. In this cohort study, adults aged 18 years and older diagnosed with any solid tumor between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020, were identified using the National Cancer Database.

The expected number of procedures for each treatment modality (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy) in 2020 were calculated using historical data (January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019) with the vector autoregressive method. The difference between expected and observed numbers was evaluated using a generalized estimating equation under assumptions of the Poisson distribution for count data. Changes in the proportion of different types of cancer treatments initiated in 2020 were evaluated using the additive outlier method. A total of 3\u202f504\u202f342 patients (1\u202f214\u202f918 in 2018, mean [SD] age, 64.6 [13.6] years; 1\u202f235\u202f584 in 2019, mean [SD] age, 64.8 [13.6] years; and 1\u202f053\u202f840 in 2020, mean [SD] age, 64.9 [13.6] years) were included.

In this large national cohort study, a significant deficit was noted in the number of cancer treatments provided in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data indicated that this deficit in the number of cancer treatments provided was associated with decreases in the number of cancer diagnoses, not changes in treatment strategies.",

        "AbstractText": "Participant recruitment has always been a major challenge in clinical trials. This study aimed to develop and validate the Join Clinical Trial Questionnaire (JoinCT), exploring the willingness to join a clinical trial and associated factors in patients. This questionnaire development study involved four phases: (i) exploring and understanding the subject matter, (ii) questionnaire development, (iii) content validity testing, and lastly, (iv) field-testing of the questionnaire. For the field-testing phase, a cross-sectional self-administered survey of JoinCT was conducted among cancer patients with various socio-demographic backgrounds and medical conditions. Besides content validity, Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate the internal consistency of domains, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the model fit of the JoinCT framework. A total of 389 respondents participated in the survey. Based on the results obtained from a field data collection phase, JoinCT consisted of four independent variables domains, namely \"knowledge\", \"perception of benefits\", \"perception of risks\", and \"confidence\". The only dependent variable was the willingness to participate in a clinical trial. The minimum Cronbach's alpha was 0.937, and the model fit for the overall framework of JoinCT is also excellent with Comparative Fit Index (>\u00a00.90), root mean square error approximation (<\u00a00.08), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (<\u00a00.08). The Join Clinical Trial Questionnaire (JoinCT) was successfully validated with excellent reliability and validity, and a good model fit. The main factors that contribute to willingness to participate in clinical trials are knowledge, perception of benefits, perception of risks, and confidence.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer research calls for new approaches that account for the regulatory complexities of biology. We present, in this study, the differential transcriptional regulome (DIFFREG) approach for the identification and prioritization of key transcriptional regulators and apply it to the case of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) biology. Of note, RCC has a poor prognosis and the biomarker and drug discovery studies to date have tended to focus on gene expression independent from mutations and/or post-translational modifications. DIFFREG focuses on the differential regulation between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes rather than differential gene expression and integrates transcriptome profiling with the human transcriptional regulatory network to analyze differential gene regulation between healthy and RCC cases. In this study, RNA-seq tissue samples (n\u2009=\u20091020) from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including healthy and tumor subjects, were integrated with a comprehensive human TF-gene interactome dataset (1122603 interactions between 1289 TFs and 25177 genes). Comparative analysis of DIFFREG profiles, consisting of perturbed TF-gene interactions, from three common subtypes (clear cell RCC, papillary RCC and chromophobe RCC) revealed subtype-specific alterations, supporting the hypothesis that these signatures in the transcriptional regulome profiles may be considered potential biomarkers that may play an important role in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of RCC development and translating knowledge about the genetic basis of RCC into the clinic. In addition, these indicators may help oncologists make the best decisions for diagnosis and prognosis management.",

        "AbstractText": "Routine self-monitoring of blood glucose is a low-value practice that provides limited benefit for patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus. We estimated the costs of Rethink the Strip (RTS), a multistrategy approach to the de-implementation of self-monitoring of blood glucose in primary care. RTS was conducted among 20 primary care clinics in North Carolina. We estimated the non-site-based and site-based costs of the 5 RTS strategies (practice facilitation, audit and feedback, provider champions, educational meetings, and educational materials) from the analytic perspective of an integrated health care system for 12 and 27-month time horizons. Material costs were tracked through project records, and personnel costs were assessed using activity-based costing. We used nationally based wage estimates. Total RTS costs equaled $68,941 for 12 months. Specifically, non-site-based costs comprised $16,560. Most non-site-based costs ($11,822) were from the foundational programming and coding updates to the electronic health record data to develop the audit and feedback reports. The non-site-based costs of educational meetings, practice facilitation, and educational materials were substantially lower, ranging between ~$400 and $1000. Total 12-month site-based costs equaled $2569 for a single clinic (or $52,381 for 20 clinics). Educational meetings were the most expensive strategy, averaging $1401 per clinic. The site-based costs for the 4 other implementation strategies were markedly lower, ranging between $51 for educational materials and $555 for practice facilitation per clinic. This study provides detailed cost information for implementation strategies used to support evidence-based programs in primary care clinics.",

Unique patients eligible to complete a HEAL survey (N=24,018) and 74 clinic personnel. The Stages of Implementation Completion guided documentation of preimplementation, implementation, and sustainment activities of HEAL pain clinic operations. These informed the calculations of the costs of implementation. The total time for HEAL implementation is 7 months: preimplementation and implementation phases (4\u00a0mo) and sustainment (3\u00a0mo). One hour of HEAL implementation involving a future clinical site consisting of 2 attending physicians, 1 midlevel provider, 1 nurse manager, 1 nurse, 1 radiology technician, 2 medical assistants, and 1 front desk staff will cost $572.

We aimed to define the cost from a health system perspective of delivery of a DA. Observational cohort. We interviewed or observed relevant personnel at 3 institutions with implemented DA distribution programs targeting men with prostate cancer. We then created process maps for DA delivery based on interview data. Cost determination was performed utilizing time-driven activity-based costing. Clinic visit length was measured on a subset of patients. Decisional quality measures were collected after the clinic visit. Total process time (minutes) for DA delivery was 10.14 (UCLA), 68 (Olive View-UCLA), and 25 (Vanderbilt). Total average costs (USD) per patient were $38.32 (UCLA), $59.96 (Olive View-UCLA), and $42.38 (Vanderbilt), respectively. Labor costs were the largest contributors to the cost of DA delivery. Variance analyses confirmed the cost efficiency of electronic health record (EHR) integration. We noted a shortening of clinic visit length when the DA was used, with high levels of decision quality. Time-driven activity-based costing is an effective approach to determining true inclusive costs of service delivery while also elucidating opportunities for cost containment. The absolute cost of delivering a DA to men with prostate cancer in various settings is much lower than the system costs of the treatments they consider. EHR integration streamlines DA delivery efficiency and results in substantial cost savings.",

Centralization of pancreatic surgery has led to the foundation of high-volume centers, thereby greatly facilitating the successful performance of more radical approaches. This review spotlights on recent advances in surgical approaches to pancreatic cancer and the risks and benefits of vascular reconstruction to improve resectability. Surgery being the only modality to achieve cure, multivisceral and vascular resections are being incorporated to improve dismal operability rates of\u2009<\u200910%. Great leaps have been made in neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment, as targeted and specific chemotherapeutic agents are being continually added. The concept of borderline and locally advanced pancreatic tumors and the use of neoadjuvant chemorad has extended the indications of oncological resection in such tumors. Venous resections are being routinely performed so as to facilitate en bloc removal of tumors, while arterial resections, owing to the increased morbidity and mortality, are offered to highly selective cases. New techniques like the triangle operation and periarterial divestment have opened new viable surgical options. Although laparoscopic approach is time consuming, it offers reduced operative blood loss and a shortened hospital stay at specialized centers. Robotic surgery may produce better results in patients needing vascular resection and reconstruction, but the expenses involved and limited availability are major deterrents. Advanced techniques of surgical resection and vessel reconstruction provide a repository for curative-intent surgery in borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.",

Thus, the study aimed at the genomic and transcriptomic impacts of preoperative chemotherapy on HAS. Patients with HAS who underwent surgical resection at Peking University Cancer Hospital were retrospectively included in this study. Whole exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing were performed on pre-chemotherapy, non-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy samples. We then compared the alterations in molecular markers between the post-chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy groups, and between the chemotherapy-effective and chemotherapy-ineffective groups, respectively. A total of 79 tumor samples from 72 patients were collected. Compared to the non-chemotherapy group, the mutation frequencies of several genes were changed after chemotherapy, including TP53. In addition, there was a significant increase in the frequency of frameshift mutations and cytosine transversion to adenine (C\u2009>\u2009A), appearance of COSMIC signature 6 and 14, and a reduced gene copy number amplification. Interestingly, the same phenomenon was observed in chemotherapy-ineffective patients. In addition, many HAS patients had ERBB2, FGFR2, MET and HGF gene amplification. Moreover, the expression of immune-related genes, especially those related to lymphocyte activation, was down-regulated after chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is closely associated with changes in the molecular characteristics of HAS. After chemotherapy, at genomic and transcriptome level, many features were altered. These changes may be molecular markers of poor chemotherapeutic efficacy and play an important role in chemoresistance in HAS. In addition, ERBB2, FGFR2, MET and HGF gene amplification may be potential therapeutic targets for HAS.",

In the pivotal phase 3 TOPAZ-1 trial, durvalumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin significantly prolonged overall survival and progression-free survival compared with placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin in adults with advanced biliary tract cancer. Benefit from durvalumab was seen irrespective of primary tumour location, disease status at diagnosis (unresectable or recurrent), or initial levels of PD-L1 expression. The tolerability of durvalumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin was manageable. Overall, the addition of durvalumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin is a valuable new treatment option for adults with advanced biliary tract cancer. Biliary tract cancers are a diverse group of cancers that develop in the bile ducts or the gallbladder. Patients with these cancers typically have poor survival. Chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) has been the first-line treatment for biliary tract cancer for over a decade, with no new treatments further improving on its overall survival benefit until recently. Durvalumab (Imfinzi\u00ae) belongs to a class of drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors; these drugs activate the immune system to help fight cancer.

Associations between frailty and surgical outcomes, namely, the incidence of 90-day mortality and postoperative complications, were not statistically significant (P\u2009>\u20090.05). In the multivariable analyses, after adjusting for clinical risk scores calculated using six factors (timing of liver metastasis, primary tumor lymph node status, number of liver tumors, size of the largest tumor, extrahepatic metastatic disease, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level) to predict recurrence following hepatectomy for CRLM, preoperative frailty was found to be an independent risk factor for DFS (hazard ratio [HR]:2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-4.72, P\u2009=\u20090.036), OS (HR:4.17, 95% CI 1.43-10.89, P\u2009=\u20090.011), and CSS (HR:3.49, 95% CI 1.09-9.60, P\u2009=\u20090.036).

        "AbstractText": "Physical activity (PA) is an important supportive care strategy to manage cancer and treatment-related side effects, yet PA participation is low among people diagnosed with cancer. This study examined patients', health professionals', and managers' perspectives on PA throughout cancer care to glean implications for PA promotion. Random selection and purposeful sampling methods allowed for the recruitment of 21 patients (76.2% women) and 20 health professionals and managers (80% women) who participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Interview questions explored facilitators and barriers to PA participation and promotion across the cancer care continuum. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Then, qualitative thematic analysis was performed. The analysis produced five main themes describing milestones in PA participation throughout cancer care: (1) Getting Started, (2) Discovering PA Resources, (3) Taking Action, (4) Striving for Change, and (5) Returning to a \"New Normal.\" The sub-themes underscored turning points, i.e., tasks and challenges to PA participation that had to be overcome at each milestone. Achieving milestones and successfully navigating turning points were dependent on clinical, social, and community factors. Cancer patients appear to progress through a series of milestones in adopting and maintaining PA throughout cancer care. Intervention strategies aimed at promoting PA could test whether support in navigating turning points could lead to greater PA participation. These findings require replication and extension, specifically among patients who are men, younger adults, and culturally diverse.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Chromosome ends and the theory of marginotomy: implications for reproduction.",
        "AbstractText": "Telomeres are the protective structures located at the ends of linear chromosomes. They were first described in the 1930s, but their biology remained unexplored until the early 70s, when Alexey M. Olovnikov, a theoretical biologist, suggested that telomeres cannot be fully copied during DNA replication. He proposed a theory that linked this phenomenon with the limit of cell proliferation capacity and the \"duration of life\" (theory of marginotomy), and suggested a potential of telomere lenghthening for the prevention of aging (anti-marginotomy). The impact of proliferative telomere shortening on life expectancy was later confirmed. In humans, telomere shortening is counteracted by telomerase, an enzyme that is undetectable in most adult somatic cells, but present in cancer cells and adult and embryonic stem and germ cells. Although telomere length dynamics are different in male and female gametes during gametogenesis, telomere lengths are reset at the blastocyst stage, setting the initial length of the species. The role of the telomere pathway in reproduction has been explored for years, mainly because of increased infertility resulting from delayed childbearing. Short telomere length in ovarian somatic cells is associated to decreased fertility and higher aneuploidy rates in embryos. Consequently, there is a growing interest in telomere lengthening strategies, aimed at improving fertility. It has also been observed that lifestyle factors can affect telomere length and improve fertility outcomes. In this review, we discuss the implications of telomere theory in fertility, especially in oocytes, spermatozoa, and embryos, as well as therapies to enhance reproductive success.",

        "AbstractText": "Trastuzumab is a landmark agent in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2(HER2)-positive breast cancer. Nevertheless, trastuzumab also comes with unexpected cardiac side effects. Hyperoside is a natural product that serves beneficial roles in cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of hyperoside in trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity. A female C57BL/6 mice cardiotoxicity model was established via intraperitoneally injecting with trastuzumab (10 mg/kg/day, once every other day, cumulative dosage to 40 mg/kg) with or without hyperoside (15 or 30 mg/kg/day) administration. In vitro, the H9c2 cells were exposed to 1 \u03bcM trastuzumab with or without hyperoside (100 or 200 \u03bcM) administration. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiographic, myocardial enzymes levels, and pathological section examinations. TUNEL staining and Annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide flow cytometry were used to analyze the cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Compared to the control group, the LVEF, LVFS was decreased and the concentrations of cTnT, CK, CK-MB and LDH in mice were significantly increased after treatment with trastuzumab. Collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy were observed in the myocardium of the trastuzumab group. However, these changes were all reversed by different doses of hyperoside. In addition, hyperoside attenuated trastuzumab-induced myocardium apoptosis and H9c2 cells apoptosis through inhibiting the expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax. Trastuzumab abolished the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in mice and H9c2 cells, while co-treatment of hyperoside effectively increased the ratio of p-Akt/Akt. Hyperoside inhibited trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Hyperoside may be a promising therapeutic approach to trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.",

        "AbstractText": "Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia and serious sequalae which negatively affect patient quality of life. This study aimed to psychometrically validate the first disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments: the 7-item PK Deficiency Diary (PKDD) and 12-item PK Deficiency Impact Assessment (PKDIA), designed to assess signs, symptoms, and impacts of PK deficiency in patients enrolled in the ACTIVATE global phase 3 study of mitapivat versus placebo (NCT03548220). All validation analyses for the PKDD and PKDIA were performed on blinded data, with analyses on item integrity, scoring, reliability, and validity conducted on data from screening and baseline. Completion rates and baseline response distributions were characterized using descriptive statistics. Item response modelling was used to inform a weighted scoring system. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency and test-retest reliability; and validity by convergent and known-groups analyses. Of the 80 adults enrolled, baseline data were available for 77 (96.3%) and 78 (97.5%) patients for the PKDD and PKDIA, respectively. Item responses skewed right, indicating that mean values exceeded median values, especially for items utilizing a 0-10 numeric scale, which were subsequently recoded to a 0-4 scale; 4 items were removed from the PKDIA due to redundancy or low relevance to the trial population. Both the PKDD and PKDIA demonstrated high internal consistency (McDonald's coefficient \u03c9\u2009=\u20090.86 and 0.90, respectively), test-retest reliability (intra-class coefficients of 0.94 and 0.87, respectively), and convergent validity with other PROs (linear correlation coefficients [|r|] between 0.30-0.73 and 0.50-0.82, respectively). The findings provide evidence of validity and reliability for the PKDD and PKDIA, the first disease-specific PRO measures for PK deficiency, and can therefore increase understanding of, and more accurately capture, the wider impact of PK deficiency on health-related quality of life. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03548220. Registered June 07, 2018; https://www. gov/ct2/show/NCT03548220 . Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a rare genetic blood disorder with a wide range of signs and symptoms that may have a negative impact on patients\u2019 quality of life. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments are tools that assess how a disease affects a patient from the patient\u2019s perspective. These instruments must go through a validation process to make sure they truly capture the patient\u2019s experience with their condition or its treatment. This study aimed to validate two new PRO instruments in adult patients enrolled in the ACTIVATE clinical trial (NCT03548220), where patients with PK deficiency received the drug mitapivat or a placebo. These two new PRO instruments are the first to be developed specifically for PK deficiency: the PK Deficiency Diary (PKDD), a daily diary that asks 7 questions to measure the core signs and symptoms of PK deficiency, and the PK Deficiency Impact Assessment (PKDIA), a weekly questionnaire with 12 questions to assess the impact of PK deficiency on a patient\u2019s life. The results of this study showed that the PKDD and PKDIA properly and reliably measured the signs, symptoms, and impacts of PK deficiency that they aimed to capture. These findings indicate that the PKDD and PKDIA are the first validated PROs specifically for PK deficiency and can help improve the understanding of the impact of PK deficiency on patients\u2019 quality of life.",

The objective of this study was to analyze the cost-utility of Palbociclib and Ribociclib in comparison with Letrozole monotherapy as the first-line treatment for hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) MBC patients in Iran. A Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA) was conducted using a partitioned survival model (PSM) from the perspective of the Iranian healthcare system. The comparative strategies considered were Palbociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole, Ribociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole, and Letrozole monotherapy. The model was structured with a 1-month cycle length and a 15-year time horizon. Clinical safety, efficacy, and survival data in terms of PFS and OS for Palbociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole and Ribociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole were obtained from the latest updates of the PALOMA-1, 2, and MONALEESA-2 studies, respectively. Direct medical costs, including drug costs, visits, hospitalization, CT scans, bone x-rays, monitoring and laboratory testing, as well as medication side effects, were considered. Uncertainty evaluations were performed through deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Excel 2016 and TreeAge 2020 were used for all stages of the evaluation. The base case results indicated that, despite its lower effectiveness, Letrozole monotherapy was the most cost-effective strategy, while Palbociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole and Ribociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole were not cost-effective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for Palbociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole and Ribociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole compared to Letrozole monotherapy were estimated at $137,302 and $120,478 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), respectively, which exceeded the target threshold of $4565. Deterministic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the CUA results were not sensitive to changes in the values of uncertain variables. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis also indicated that Palbociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole and Ribociclib\u2009+\u2009Letrozole had no chance of being cost-effective based on changes in various parameters and simulations. Palbociclib and Ribociclib showed significant efficacy in combination with Letrozole, as evidenced by improvements in PFS. However, in the first-line treatment of MBC in Iran, these strategies were not cost-effective compared to Letrozole monotherapy.",

        "AbstractText": "The lack of clinical markers prevents early diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM). Many studies have found that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can be used as early diagnostic markers of malignant tumours. Therefore, the identification of novel circulating miRNA biomolecular markers could be beneficial to clinicians in the early diagnosis of GBM. We developed a decision tree joint scoring algorithm (DTSA), systematically integrating significance analysis of microarray (SAM), Pearson hierarchical clustering, T test, Decision tree and Entropy weight score algorithm, to screen out circulating miRNA molecular markers with high sensitivity and accuracy for early diagnosis of GBM. DTSA was developed and applied for GBM datasets and three circulating miRNA molecular markers were identified, namely, hsa-miR-2278, hsa-miR-555 and hsa-miR-892b. We have found that hsa-miR-2278 and hsa-miR-892b regulate the GBM pathway through target genes, promoting the development of GBM and affecting the survival of patients. DTSA has better classification effect in all data sets than other classification algorithms, and identified miRNAs are better than existing markers of GBM. These results suggest that DTSA can effectively identify circulating miRNA, thus contributing to the early diagnosis and personalised treatment of GBM.",

As of now, no universally endorsed standard therapeutic approaches for HSC have been established. Herein, we describe the case of a 60-year-old individual diagnosed with HSC, subsequently presenting with multiple metastases postoperatively. Owing to the pronounced expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), the individual was subjected to monotherapy utilizing sintilimab for a duration spanning 12\u00a0months. Following this regimen, a synergistic treatment approach comprising both anlotinib and sintilimab was instituted, culminating in an ensuing 11\u00a0months of efficacious therapeutic response. Throughout the course of treatment, the patient's quality of life remained satisfactory. This particular therapeutic strategy not merely reinforces the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in the realm of HSC management, but more pivotally, suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) might counteract resistance to PD-1 antagonists, thus offering a potentially augmented treatment paradigm for HSC.",

Data on patients' surgical data, complications, histologic data, renal function, and survival outcomes were collected and analyzed. Compared with the LRN group, the LPN group had a longer operative time (135\u00a0min vs. 102.5\u00a0min, p\u2009=\u20090.001), larger intraoperative bleeding (150\u00a0ml vs. 50\u00a0ml, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and required longer stays in hospital (8\u00a0days vs. 6\u00a0days, p\u2009<\u20090.001); however, the level of ECT-GFR was superior at 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, a greater number of LRN patients developed CKD compared with LPN until postoperative 12\u00a0months (58.8% vs. 19.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

        "AbstractText": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is a deadly malignancy. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) with programmed death ligand 1 (sEV-PDL1) induce immune escape to promote tumor progression. Furthermore, the imbalance between circulating follicular helper T (Tfh) and circulating follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells is related to the progression of many malignant tumors. However, the role of the EC-derived sEV-PDL1 in circulating Tfh/Tfr is unknown. Circulating Tfh and Tfr cells were detected by flow cytometry. sEVs were isolated through differential centrifugation and cultured for cell expansion assays. Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were isolated, stimulated, and cultured with sEVs to evaluate the frequencies, phenotypes, and functions of Tfh and Tfr cells. The proportion of circulating Tfh in patients with EC was lower than that in healthy donors (HDs), whereas that of circulating Tfr was higher. The EC group showed significantly lower circulating Tfh/Tfr and a higher level of sEV-PDL1 than HDs. Notably, sEV-PDL1 was negatively correlated with circulating Tfh/Tfr in the EC group. In vitro assays, sEV-PDL1 inhibited Tfh expansion, enhanced the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4+ (CTLA4+) Tfh cell percentage, decreased the levels of interleukin (IL)-21 and interferon-\u03b3, and increased IL-10. sEV-PDL1 promoted the expansion and immunosuppressive functions of circulating Tfr; the increased percentages of CTLA4+ Tfr and inducible T cell co-stimulator+ Tfr were accompanied with high IL-10. However, applying an anti-PDL1 antibody significantly reversed this. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of sEV-PDL1-mediated immunosuppression in EC.

Some chemical compounds impede tumor/cancer via the inception of mPT pore opening. Ciprofloxacin has been demonstrated to hinder growth and effect apoptosis in some cancer cells. However, using a rat model, this study investigated its effect on mitochondrial-mediated cell death via mPT pore opening and estradiol benzoate (EB)-induced endometrial hyperplasia. Mitochondria were isolated using differential centrifugation. The opening of the pore, cytochrome c release (CCR), mitochondrial ATPase (mATPase) activity, mitochondrial lipid peroxidation (mLPO), caspases 3 and 9 levels, and hepatic DNA fragmentation were determined. Histological evaluation of hepatic and uterine sections and immunoexpression levels of Bax, caspase 3, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 levels were quantified. The results show that ciprofloxacin caused mPT pore opening, CCR, mATPase activity, effected mLPO, caspases 3 and 9 activations, and hepatic DNA fragmentation. The histology of the liver section showed moderate to marked disseminated congestion at 100 mg/kg, while higher doses showed severe hepatic damage. Severe EH was detected in the EB-treated rats which was attenuated by ciprofloxacin in the treatment group.

Pemphigus diseases are distinguished from pemphigoid diseases as well as dermatitis herpetiformis. In pemphigus diseases, cutaneous blistering is caused by an intraepidermal loss of adhesion between keratinocytes. In pemphigoid diseases, blister formation is due to a\u00a0subepidermal loss of adhesion of keratinocytes from the basement membrane. This article reviews the most important trigger factors associated with bullous autoimmune dermatoses and discusses their role in their initial manifestation as well as exacerbation. A\u00a0focused review of the literature including original articles, guidelines, reference works and previously published review articles was performed. Vaccinations, viral infections, ultraviolet light (UV) exposure and radiation therapies are possible triggers of pemphigus vulgaris in predisposed patients. For the much rarer pemphigus foliaceus, UV exposure is of particular importance. Thiols and phenols are drugs that can induce pemphigus usually resembling pemphigus foliaceus clinically. Age is the most important risk factor of bullous pemphigoid. In addition, in bullous pemphigoid associations with dipeptidyl peptidase\u00a04\u00a0inhibitors, programmed cell death protein\u20111 or programmed death-ligand\u20111 inhibitors as well as neurological diseases are particularly relevant. Severe mucosal damage, certain drugs and in particular cases neoplasms might play a\u00a0role in mucous membrane pemphigoid. Knowing possible trigger factors facilitates a\u00a0timely diagnosis upon initial manifestation and supports the prevention of relapse of bullous autoimmune dermatoses.

Die kutane Blasenbildung der Pemphiguserkrankungen beruht auf einem intraepidermalen Adh\u00e4sionsverlust zwischen den Keratinozyten, bei Pemphigoiderkrankungen auf einem subepidermalen Adh\u00e4sionsverlust der Keratinozyten von der Basalmembran. Der nachfolgende Beitrag bietet einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die wichtigsten Triggerfaktoren blasenbildender Autoimmundermatosen, deren Einfluss sowohl bei Erstmanifestation als auch bei Exazerbation der Erkrankungen diskutiert wird. Es erfolgten eine gezielte Literaturrecherche und Sichtung von Originalien, Leitlinien, Referenzwerken und bereits publizierten \u00dcbersichtsartikeln. Impfungen, Virusinfektionen, UV-Exposition und Strahlentherapie sind m\u00f6gliche Trigger eines Pemphigus vulgaris bei pr\u00e4disponierten Patienten. F\u00fcr den deutlich selteneren Pemphigus foliaceus ist insbesondere eine UV-Exposition von Relevanz. Thiole und Phenole sind Arzneimittel, die einen Pemphigus induzieren k\u00f6nnen, der klinisch in der Regel dem Pemphigus foliaceus \u00e4hnelt. Wichtigster Risikofaktor des bull\u00f6sen Pemphigoids ist das Alter eines Patienten. Zudem sind v.\u00a0a. Therapien mit Dipeptidylpeptidase-4-Inhibitioren, PD-1(\u201eprogrammed cell death protein\u00a01\u201c)- oder PD-L1(\u201eprogrammed death-ligand\u00a01\u201c)-Inhibitoren und neurologische Erkrankungen bedeutsam. Beim Schleimhautpemphigoid k\u00f6nnten schwere Schleimhautsch\u00e4digungen, einige Medikamente und in bestimmten F\u00e4llen Neoplasien eine Rolle spielen. Kenntnisse etwaiger Trigger erleichtern eine fr\u00fchzeitige Diagnosestellung bei Erstmanifestation und unterst\u00fctzen die Rezidivprophylaxe bull\u00f6ser Autoimmundermatosen.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Functionalized Fe-Doped Carbon Dots Exhibiting Dual Glutathione Consumption to Amplify Ferroptosis for Enhanced Cancer Therapy.",
        "AbstractText": "Nonapoptotic ferroptosis is a promising cancer treatment which offers a solution to the multidrug resistance of conventional apoptosis-induced programmed cancer cell death therapies. Reducing intracellular glutathione (GSH) is essential for inducing excess ROS and has been considered a crucial process to trigger ferroptosis. However, treatments reducing GSH alone have not produced satisfactory effects due to their restricted target. In this regard, FeCDs (Fe3+-modified l-histidine -sourced carbon dots) with dual GSH-consumption capabilities were constructed to engineer ferroptosis by self-amplifying intratumoral oxidative stress. Carbon dots have the ability to consume GSH, and the introduction of Fe3+ can amplify the GSH-consuming ability of CDs, reacting with excess H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment to generate highly oxidized \u2022OH. This is a novel strategy through synergistic self-amplification therapy combining Fe3+ and CDs with GSH-consuming activity. The acid-triggered degradation material (FeCDs@PAE-PEG) was prepared by encapsulating FeCDs in an oil-in-water manner. Compared with other ferroptosis-triggering nanoparticles, the established FeCDs@PAE-PEG is targeted and significantly enhances the consumption efficiency of GSH and accumulation of excess iron without the involvement of infrared light and ultrasound. This synergistic strategy exhibits excellent ferroptosis-inducing ability and antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo and offers great potential for clinical translation of ferroptosis.",

        "AbstractText": "In 2023, nearly 2 million patients will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States and at least 40% will be eligible for treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). Cutaneous immune related adverse events (cirAEs) from ICIs are common and include pruritus as well as maculopapular, eczematous, bullous, lichenoid, and psoriasiform reactions. All clinicians interfacing with cancer patients must expedite proper evaluation and diagnosis, treatment, and/or consultation that supports the need for evidence-directed guidelines. A panel of advisors was selected, and a systematic literature review generated foundational evidence to develop a treatment algorithm for cirAEs via a modified Delphi process. Iterations of the algorithm were performed until the group met consensus. An algorithm that tailors the management of cirAEs was developed based on the CTCAE v.5 grading of skin disorders. Representative clinical images and suggested diagnostic measures, supplement the algorithm. Recognition and treatment of cirAEs guided through a multidisciplinary, physician-developed algorithm will limit disruption of immunotherapy, optimize quality of life, and enhance overall outcomes in patients treated with ICIs.

        "AbstractText": "In the Nordic European countries in 2020, cancer diagnoses accounted for 175,925 patients. About 50% of cancer patients receive radiation therapy (RT), which may lead to radiation dermatitis (RD). Notably, patients with breast, head, neck, and anal cancers may be prone to developing RD. However, few algorithms exist for the prevention and treatment of RD. The Nordic European Cutaneous Oncodermatology Management (NECOM) project aims to improve cancer patient outcomes by offering tools to prevent and treat cancer therapy-related cutaneous adverse events (cAEs). The first 2 NECOM papers presented various cAEs and skincare regimens involving hygiene, moisturization, sun protection, and camouflage products for preventing and managing cAEs. The NECOM 3 practical algorithm for preventing and managing acute RD (ARD) is intended to promote healthy skin and reduce RT-related ARD, improving cancer patient outcomes.&nbsp; Results: The NECOM advisors discussed the results of a systematic literature review and obtained consensus on the evidence and opinion-based practical algorithm for ARD to support all stakeholders in the Nordic European healthcare setting. The algorithm starts with skin-preserving therapy, followed by skin condition assessment and patient-specific interventions based on the grade of RD present.&nbsp; Conclusion: ARD may lead to symptoms of pruritus and pain, decreased QoL and morbidity, and treatment interruptions. Patient education on the prevention of RD and treatment recommendations given in the NECOM 3 algorithm may help prevent and manage RD and improve the overall care of patients receiving RT.

        "AbstractText": "Vaccinia-Related Kinase 2 (VRK2) is an anti-apoptotic Ser/Thr kinase that enhances drug sensitivity in cancer cells. This protein exists in two isoforms: VRK2A, the longer variant, and VRK2B, which lacks the C-terminal region and transmembrane domain. While the therapeutic importance of VRK2 family proteins is known, the specific roles of VRK2A and its interplay with apoptotic regulator Bcl-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra Large) remain elusive. Bcl-xL regulates cell death by interacting with BAX (B-cell lymphoma-2 Associated X-protein), controlling its cellular localization and influencing BAX-associated processes and signalling pathways. As VRK2A interacts with the Bcl-xL-BAX complex, comprehending its regulatory engagement with Bcl-xL presents potential avenues for intervening in diseases. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, this study provides information on the cellular localization of VRK2A and establishes its interaction with Bcl-xL in the cellular milieu, pinpointing the interacting site and elucidating its antiapoptotic property within the complex. Furthermore, this study also put forth a model that highlights the importance of VRK2A in stabilizing the ternary complex, formedwith Bcl-xL and BAX, thereby impeding BAX dissociation and hence apoptosis. Therefore, further investigations associated with this important revelation will provide cues for designing cancer therapeutics in the future.",

The trial was terminated prematurely after treatment of 295 patients because of a high proportion of treatment-related deaths, three of which were due to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab treatment arm. In addition, we encountered two cases of CRS that were effectively managed, for a total of five cases (3.4%) among the 148 patients in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm. We here provide details of these five cases. Although patient background and timing of CRS onset differed, fever was observed before the emergence of CRS in all five cases. Oncologists should thus be aware that the development of fever during treatment of patients with nivolumab plus ipilimumab may herald the onset of CRS.",

This study examines relationships between cancer screening and receipt of government housing assistance among adults with low income. Data are from the 2019 and 2021 National Health Interview Survey. Eligible respondents were classified as up-to-date or not with breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CVC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model guideline-concordant screening by receipt of government housing assistance, overall and stratified by urban-rural status, race/ethnicity, and age. Analyses were performed in 2023. Analyses for BC, CVC and CRC screening included 2,258, 3,132, and 3,233 respondents, respectively. There was no difference in CVC screening by housing assistance status, but screening for BC and CRC was higher among those who received assistance compared to those who did not (59.7% vs. 50.8%, p<0.01 for BC; 57.1% vs. 44.1%, p<0.01 for CRC). In models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, health status and insurance, these differences were not statistically significant for either BC or CRC screening. In stratified adjusted models, housing assistance was statistically significantly associated with increased BC screening in urban areas (aOR=1.35, 95% CI=1.00-1.82) and among Hispanic women (aOR=2.20, 95% CI=1.01-4.78) and women 45-54 years of age (aOR=2.10, 95% CI=1.17-3.75). Policies that address housing affordability may enhance access to BC screening for some subgroups, including women in urban areas, Hispanic women, and younger women. More research on the mechanisms that link housing assistance to BC screening is needed.",

After more than 30 years of application, the HBV vaccine has reduced 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, vaccine escape variants occur under selective pressure induced by widespread vaccination and antiviral therapy, which results in fulminant infection and horizontal transmission. Several mechanisms have been studied to explain HBV vaccine escape, including vaccine escape mutations (VEMs) in the major hydrophilic region, which leads to a decrease in the binding ability to neutralize antibodies and is the primary escape mechanism, protein conformational and N-linked glycosylation sites changes caused by VEMs, differences in genotype distribution, gene recombination, and some temporarily unknown reasons. However, effective solutions are still being explored. The HPV vaccine has also been proven to prevent 70%-90% of cervical cancer worldwide. Cases of HPV infection after being vaccinated have been observed in clinical practice. However, few researchers have paid attention to the mechanism of HPV vaccine escape. Thus, we reviewed the literature on vaccine escape of both HBV and HPV to discuss the mechanism of the virus escaping from vaccine protection and possible solutions to this problem. We analyzed the gap between studies of HPV and HBV and made prospects for further research in HPV vaccine escape.",

Since then, research efforts have been made to characterize the microbiome in healthy and cancerous breast tissues. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence for the association of the breast microbiome with breast cancer risk and progression. Briefly, while many studies have examined the breast microbiome in breast cancer patients, and compared it to the microbiome of benign breast disease tissue or normal breast tissue, these studies have varied widely in their sample sizes, methods, and quality of evidence. Thus, while several large and rigorous cross-sectional studies have provided key evidence of an altered microbiome in breast tumors compared to normal adjacent and healthy control tissue, there are few consistent patterns of perturbed microbial taxa. Additionally, only one large prospective study has provided evidence of a relationship between the breast tumor microbiota and cancer prognosis. Future research studies featuring large, well-characterized cohorts with prospective follow-up for breast cancer incidence, progression, and response to treatment are warranted.",

        "AbstractText": "KRAS is among the most commonly mutated oncogenes in cancer, and previous studies have shown associations with survival in many cancer contexts. Evidence from both clinical observations and mouse experiments further suggests that these associations are allele- and tissue-specific. These findings motivate using clinical data to understand gene interactions and clinical covariates within different alleles and tissues. We analyze genomic and clinical data from the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative for samples from lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. For each of these cancer types, we report epidemiological associations for different KRAS alleles, apply principal component analysis to discover groups of genes co-mutated with KRAS, and identify distinct clusters of patient profiles with implications for survival. KRAS mutations were associated with inferior survival in lung, colon, and pancreas, although the specific mutations implicated varied by disease. Tissue- and allele-specific associations with smoking, sex, age, and race were found. Tissue-specific genetic interactions with KRAS were identified by principal components analysis, which were clustered to produce five, four, and two patient profiles in lung, colon, and pancreas. Membership in these profiles was associated with survival in all three cancer types. KRAS mutations have tissue- and allele-specific associations with inferior survival, clinical covariates, and genetic interactions. Our results provide greater insight into the tissue- and allele-specific associations with KRAS mutations and identify clusters of patients that are associated with survival and clinical attributes from combinations of genetic interactions with KRAS mutations.",

In addition to genomic alterations, cancer transcriptional profiling can be helpful to tailor cancer treatment and to estimate each patient's outcome. Transcriptional activity levels of 50 molecular pathways were inferred in 4,573 LUAD patients using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) method. Seven LUAD subtypes were defined and independently validated based on the combined behavior of the studied pathways: AD (adenocarcinoma subtype)1-7. AD1, AD4 and AD5 subtypes were associated with better overall survival. AD1 and AD4 subtypes were enriched in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, whereas AD2 and AD6 showed higher tumor protein p53 (TP53) alteration frequencies. AD2 and AD6 subtypes correlated with higher genome instability, proliferation-related pathways expression and specific sensitivity to chemotherapy, based on data from LUAD cell lines. LUAD subtypes were able to predict immunotherapy response in addition to CD274 (PD-L1) gene expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB). AD2 and AD4 subtypes were associated with potential resistance and response to immunotherapy, respectively. Thus, analysis of transcriptomic data could improve patient stratification beyond genomics and single biomarkers (i.e., PD-L1, TMB) and may lay the foundation for more personalized treatment avenues, especially in driver-negative LUAD.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether oxycodone is associated with an increased risk of acute respiratory conditions in patients with cancer and CKD compared with other opioids. The data were obtained from a claims database in Japan. Patients with cancer and CKD who had received sustained-release opioids, including oral oxycodone, oral morphine, or transdermal fentanyl, between April 2014 and May 2021 were selected. The primary outcome was defined as an acute respiratory condition. Data for age and sex, morphine equivalent daily dose, concomitant use of specified medications, comorbidities defined based on the modified Charlson comorbidity index, substance use disorder, and lung cancer or metastatic lung cancer were investigated as covariates. Distribution of acute respiratory conditions was compared among the three sustained-release opioid groups using the log-rank test. Estimates of the incidence of acute respiratory conditions were compared among the groups using a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying variables. A significant difference in the distribution of acute respiratory conditions was found among the three groups (P<0.01). Cox regression analysis showed a significantly higher risk of acute respiratory conditions with morphine (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-8.65, P=0.04) compared with oxycodone but no significant difference in risk with oxycodone (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.32-1.38, P=0.27) compared with fentanyl. The findings suggest that the risk of acute respiratory conditions may be lower in patients with CKD who use oxycodone for cancer pain than in those who use morphine.

We constructed diet and standardized lifestyle scores based on core WCRF/AICR recommendations on diet, alcohol intake, body size and physical activity, and additional scores incorporating weight change, sedentary behavior and smoking. Associations with cancer risk were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for confounders. During follow-up (mean=16 years), 4,710 incident cancers were diagnosed. For highest quintile ('most adherent') of the standardized lifestyle score, compared with lowest ('least adherent'), a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74 to 0.92] was observed for total cancer. This association was stronger with smoking included in the score (HR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.81). A higher score was associated with lower breast and prostate cancer risk for the standardized score, and with lung, stomach, rectal and pancreatic cancer risk when the score included smoking.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the effect on CC progression of ZC3H13-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification to stabilize cytoskeleton-associated protein 2 (CKAP2) expression. CC tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues were collected from 50 patients. qRT-PCR was used to clarify ZC3H13 and CKAP2 expression levels in the CC tissues. The functional roles of ZC3H13 and CKAP2 in CC were analyzed by detecting the changes in CC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth in vivo. The regulatory relationship between ZC3H13 and CKAP2 was investigated by confirming m6A modification levels and their expression correlation. ZC3H13 and CKAP2 were highly expressed in CC and linked with poor prognosis. We observed that ZC3H13 inhibition decreased CC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, while its facilitation promoted CC cell malignancy. ZC3H13 mediated m6A modification of CKAP2 to enhance CKAP2 expression in CC cells. Furthermore, CKAP2 overexpression partially restored the malignant phenotypic promotion induced by ZC3H13 overexpression in CC cells. In summary, this study revealed that ZC3H13-mediating m6A modification of CKAP2 promotes CC development. This finding should be conducive to an understanding of the role of ZC3H13-m6A-CKAP2 in CC and should provide an effective therapeutic target for this cancer.",

The CENP-T and CENP-W chains form a heterodimer, which is an integral part of the inner kinetochore, interacting with the linker DNA on one side and the outer kinetochore on the other. Additionally, the CENP-T-W dimer interacts with other regulatory proteins involved in forming inner kinetochores. The specific roles of different amino acids in the CENP-W at the protein-protein interaction (PPI) interface during the CENP-T-W dimer formation remain incompletely understood. Since cell division goes awry in diseases like cancer, this CENP-T-W partnership is a potential target for new drugs that could restore healthy cell division. We employed molecular docking, binding free energy calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the disruptive effects of amino acids substitutions in the CENP-W chain on CENP-T-W dimer formation. By conducting a molecular docking study and analysing hydrogen bonding interactions, we identified key residues in CENP-W (ASN-46, ARG-53, LEU-83, SER-86, ARG-87, and GLY-88) for further investigation. Through site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent binding free energy calculations, we refined the selection of mutant. We chose four mutants (N46K, R53K, L83K, and R87E) of CENP-W to assess their comparative potential in forming CENP-T-W dimer. Our analysis from 250\u2009ns long revealed that the substitution of LEU83 and ARG53 residues in CENP-W with the LYS significantly disrupts the formation of CENP-T-W dimer. In conclusion, LEU83 and ARG53 play a critical role in CENP-T and CENP-W dimerization which is ultimately required for cellular mitosis. Our findings not only deepen our understanding of cell division but also hint at exciting drug-target possibilities.",

        "AbstractText": "Bone tumor patients often encounter challenges associated with cancer cell residues and bone defects postoperation. To address this, there is an urgent need to develop a material that can enable tumor treatment and promote bone repair. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted the interest of many researchers due to their special porous structure, which has great potential in regenerative medicine and drug delivery. However, few studies explore MOFs with dual antitumor and bone regeneration properties. In this study, we investigated amino-functionalized zirconium-based MOF nanoparticles (UiO-66-NH2 NPs) as bifunctional nanomaterials for bone tumor treatment and osteogenesis promotion. UiO-66-NH2 NPs loading with doxorubicin (DOX) (DOX@UiO-66-NH2 NPs) showed good antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, DOX@UiO-66-NH2 NPs significantly reduced lung injury compared to free DOX in vivo. Interestingly, the internalized UiO-66-NH2 NPs notably promoted the osteogenic differentiation of preosteoblasts. RNA-sequencing data revealed that PI3K-Akt signaling pathways or MAPK signaling pathways might be involved in this enhanced osteogenesis. Overall, UiO-66-NH2 NPs exhibit dual functionality in tumor treatment and bone repair, making them highly promising as a bifunctional material with broad application prospects.",

        "AbstractText": "Understanding how the electronic excitation of DNA changes in response to different high-energy particles is central to advancing ion beam cancer therapy and other related approaches, such as boron neutron capture therapy. While protons have been the predominant ions of choice in ion beam cancer therapy, heavier ions, particularly carbon ions, have drawn significant attention over the past decade. Carbon ions are expected to transfer larger amounts of energy according to linear response theory. However, molecular-level details of the electronic excitation under heavier ion irradiation remain unknown. In this work, we use real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations to examine the quantum-mechanical details of DNA electronic excitations in water under proton, \u03b1-particle, and carbon ion irradiation. Our results show that the energy transfer does indeed increase for the heavier ions, while the excitation remains highly conformal. However, the increase in the energy transfer rate, measured by electronic stopping power, does not match the prediction by the linear response model, even when accounting for the velocity dependence of the irradiating ion's charge. The simulations also reveal that while the number of holes generated on DNA increases for heavier ions, the increase is only partially responsible for the larger stopping power. Larger numbers of highly energetic holes formed from the heavier ions also contribute significantly to the increased electronic stopping power.",

        "AbstractText": "Zika virus and dengue virus are co-circulating flaviviruses with a widespread endemic range. Eliciting broad and potent neutralizing antibodies is an attractive goal for developing a vaccine to simultaneously protect against these viruses. However, the capacity of viral mutations to confer escape from broadly neutralizing antibodies remains undescribed, due in part to limited throughput and scope of traditional approaches. Here, we use deep mutational scanning to map how all possible single amino acid mutations in Zika virus envelope protein affect neutralization by antibodies of varying breadth and potency. While all antibodies selected viral escape mutations, the mutations selected by broadly neutralizing antibodies conferred less escape relative to those selected by narrow, virus-specific antibodies. Surprisingly, even for broadly neutralizing antibodies with similar binding footprints, different single mutations led to escape, indicating distinct functional requirements for neutralization not captured by existing structures. Additionally, the antigenic effects of mutations selected by broadly neutralizing antibodies were conserved across divergent, albeit related, flaviviruses. Our approach identifies residues critical for antibody neutralization, thus comprehensively defining the as-yet-unknown functional epitopes of antibodies with clinical potential.IMPORTANCEThe wide endemic range of mosquito-vectored flaviviruses-such as Zika virus and dengue virus serotypes 1-4-places hundreds of millions of people at risk of infection every year. Despite this, there are no widely available vaccines, and treatment of severe cases is limited to supportive care. An avenue toward development of more widely applicable vaccines and targeted therapies is the characterization of monoclonal antibodies that broadly neutralize all these viruses. Here, we measure how single amino acid mutations in viral envelope protein affect neutralizing antibodies with both broad and narrow specificities. We find that broadly neutralizing antibodies with potential as vaccine prototypes or biological therapeutics are quantifiably more difficult to escape than narrow, virus-specific neutralizing antibodies.",

This prospective study included 592 breast cancer survivors who completed a dietary assessment. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Of the studies published until May 31, 2023, that were searched in PUBMED and EMBASE databases, 14 studies were selected. Adjusted HRs were combined using fixed- or random-effects models. During the median follow-up of 4.3\u2009years, 47 recurrences were identified. The HR (95% CI) for recurrence comparing the highest versus the lowest tertile of isoflavones intake was 1.29 (0.60-2.78). In a meta-analysis of previously published data and ours, dietary isoflavone intake was associated with a better breast cancer prognosis. The combined HRs (95% CIs) comparing the extreme categories were 0.81 (0.67-0.98) for recurrence and 0.85 (0.76-0.96) for all-cause mortality. A nonlinear inverse association was observed between isoflavone intake and the risk of recurrence and all-cause mortality.

        "AbstractText": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an efficient approach for non-invasive cancer treatment. However, organic small-molecule photosensitizers are often associated with defects in hydrophobicity, poor photostability, and aggregation-caused quenching, which limit their application. Usually, the carrier-assisted drug delivery system is a common strategy to solve the above obstacles, but additional carrier material could increase the risk of potential biological toxicity. The carrier-free drug delivery system with easy preparation and high drug-loading capability is proposed subsequently as a potential strategy to develop the clinical use of hydrophobic drugs. Herein, we rationally designed three IR780-based carrier-free nanosystems formed by carbon/disulfide/diselenide bond conjugated IR780-based homodimers. The IR780-based homodimers could self-assemble to form nanoparticles (DC-NP, DS-NP, DSe-NP) and exhibited higher reactive oxygen species generation capability and photostability than free IR780, in which DSe-NP with 808 nm laser irradiation performed best and resulted in the strongest cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells. Meanwhile, the glutathione consumption ability of DSe-NP boosted its PDT effect and then induced excessive oxidative stress of 4T1 cells, increasing antitumor efficacy by enhancing immunogenic cell death further. In tumor-bearing mice, DSe-NP displayed obvious tumor site accumulation, which obviously inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, and enhanced the immunological effect by effectively inducing dendritic cells to mature and activating T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. In summary, our study presented an IR780-based carrier-free nanodelivery system for a combination of PDT and immunity therapy and established expanding the application of organic small-molecule photosensitizers by an approach of carrier-free drug delivery system.",

Ascorbic acid (AA) has potential for tumor therapy; however, the mechanism underlying the ability of AA to selectively kill tumor cells remains unclear. AA can cause redox disequilibrium in tumor cells, resulting in the release of abundant reactive oxygen species, represented by hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). Therefore, the detection of H2 O2 changes can provide insight into the selective killing mechanism of AA against tumor cells. In this work, inspired by the ion-exchange mechanism in coral formation, a flexible H2 O2 sensor (PtNFs/CoPi@CC) is constructed to monitor the dynamics of H2 O2 in the cell microenvironment, which exhibits excellent sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Moreover, the findings suggest that dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the oxidation product of AA, is highly possible the substance that actually acts on tumor cells in AA therapy. Additionally, the intracellular redox disequilibrium and H2 O2 release caused by DHA are positively correlated with the abundance and activity of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). In conclusion, this work has revealed the potential mechanism underlying the ability of AA to selectively kill tumor cells through the construction and use of PtNFs/CoPi@CC.

Cyclin D1 has been recognized as an oncogene since it was upregulated in several different types of cancers. It is known that the post-translational regulation of cyclin D1 is controlled by ubiquitination / proteasome degradation system in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Several cullin-associated F-box E3 ligases have been shown to regulate cyclin D1 degradation; however, it is not known if additional cullin-associated E3 ligases participate in the regulation of cyclin D1 protein stability. In this study, we have screened a siRNA library containing siRNAs specific for 154 ligase subunits, including F-box, SOCS, BTB-containing proteins and DDB proteins. We found that multiple cullin-associated E3 ligases regulate cyclin D1 activity, including Keap1, DDB2 and WSB2.

Participants were administered clarithromycin-containing triple therapy (clarithromycin 500\u2005mg, amoxicillin 1000\u2005mg, esomeprazole 40\u2005mg) twice daily. Randomization was applied based on two factors: 1)addition of Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 500\u2005mg BID or not; 2)treatment duration of 10 or 14 days.

However, the ultimate goal is the ability to use unedited autosegmented OARs in treatment planning, while maintaining the plan quality. We tested this approach with head and neck (HN) OARs generated by a prototype deep-learning (DL) model on patients previously treated for oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancer. Forty patients were selected, with all structures delineated by an experienced physician. For each patient, a set of 13 OARs were generated by the DL model. Each patient was re-planned based on original targets and unedited DL-produced OARs. The new dose distributions were then applied back to the manually delineated structures. The target coverage was evaluated with inhomogeneity index (II) and the relative volume of regret. For the OARs, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of areas under the DVH curves, individual DVH objectives, and composite continuous plan quality metric (PQM) were compared. The nearly identical primary target coverage for the original and re-generated plans was achieved, with the same II and relative volume of regret values. The average DSC of the areas under the corresponding pairs of DVH curves was 0.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06. The number of critical DVH points which met the clinical objectives with the dose optimized on autosegmented structures but failed when evaluated on the manual ones was 5 of 896 (0.6%). The average OAR PQM score with the re-planned dose distributions was essentially the same when evaluated either on the autosegmented or manual OARs. Thus, rigorous HN treatment planning is possible with OARs segmented by a prototype DL algorithm with minimal, if any, manual editing.",

Aberrantly high ERK activation triggers oncogene-induced senescence, which halts tumor progression. Here we report that low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia displays very high levels of phospho-ERK consistent with a senescence response. However, advanced lesions that have circumvented the senescence barrier exhibit lower phospho-ERK levels. Restoring ERK hyperactivation in PDAC using activated RAF leads to ERK-dependent growth arrest with senescence biomarkers. ERK-dependent senescence in PDAC was characterized by a nucleolar stress response including a selective depletion of nucleolar phosphoproteins and intranucleolar foci containing RNA polymerase I designated as senescence-associated nucleolar foci (SANF). Accordingly, combining ribosome biogenesis inhibitors with ERK hyperactivation reinforced the senescence response in PDAC cells. Notably, comparable mechanisms were observed upon treatment with the platinum-based chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRINOX, currently a first-line treatment option for PDAC. We thus suggest that drugs targeting ribosome biogenesis can improve the senescence anticancer response in pancreatic cancer.",

Phillyrin (PHN), an effective lignan glycoside of Forsythia suspensa, has been explored as a potential anticancer agent in some cancer types. However, it is unclear whether and how PHN could promote the death of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by inducing ferroptosis. Our study showed for the first time that PHN induced cell death and attenuated cell proliferation in NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Functional assays showed that ferroptosis was the predominant form that contributed to PHN-induced cell death of NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, NSCLC cells exposed to PHN had a decreased ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) and SLC7A11 protein expression. Exogenetic overexpression of FTH1 substantially abrogated the tumor-inhibiting effects of PHN and further upregulated the expression of SLC7A11 in NSCLC cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the natural product PHN exerted its antitumor activity in NSCLC by promoting ferroptosis, and the FTH1/SLC7A11 axis plays an indispensable role in PHN-induced ferroptotic cell death.",

Although blood plasma is easily obtainable, analysis of EVs at the single particle level is still challenging due to the biological complexity of this body fluid. Besides EVs, plasma contains different types of lipoproteins particles (LPPs), that outnumber EVs by orders of magnitude and which partially overlap in biophysical properties such as size, density and molecular makeup. Consequently, during EV isolation LPPs are often co-isolated. Furthermore, physical EV-LPP complexes have been observed in purified EV preparations. Since co-isolation or association of LPPs can impact EV-based analysis and biomarker profiling, we investigated the presence and formation of EV-LPP complexes in biological samples by using label-free atomic force microscopy, cryo-electron tomography and synchronous Rayleigh and Raman scattering analysis of optically trapped particles and fluorescence-based high sensitivity single particle flow cytometry. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact on flow cytometric analysis in the presence of LPPs using in vitro spike-in experiments of purified tumour cell line-derived EVs in different classes of purified human LPPs. Based on orthogonal single-particle analysis techniques we demonstrate that EV-LPP complexes can form under physiological conditions. Furthermore, we show that in fluorescence-based flow cytometric EV analysis staining of LPPs, as well as EV-LPP associations, can influence quantitative and qualitative EV analysis. Lastly, we demonstrate that the colloidal matrix of the biofluid in which EVs reside impacts their buoyant density, size and/or refractive index (RI), which may have consequences for down-stream EV analysis and EV biomarker profiling.",

The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and efficacy of therapies, both currently marketed and under clinical development, may be directly impacted by the physiological alterations that occur secondary to the occurrence of chronic excess body weight.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology recently reported that 40% of obese patients receive insufficient chemotherapy doses and exposures, which may lead to reduced efficacy, and recommended pharmacokinetic studies to guide appropriate dosing in these patients. These issues will only increase in importance as the incidence of obesity in the population increases. This publication reviews the effects of obesity on (1) tumor biology, development of cancer, and antitumor response; (2) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of small-molecule anticancer drugs; and (3) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of complex anticancer drugs, such as carrier-mediated agents and biologics. These topics are not only important from a scientific research perspective but also from a drug development and regulator perspective. Thus, it is important to evaluate the effects of obesity on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anticancer agents in all categories of body habitus and especially in patients who are obese and morbidly obese. As the effects of obesity on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anticancer agents may be highly variable across drug types, the optimal dosing metric and algorithm for difference classes of drugs may be widely different.

        "ArticleTitle": "A Mild Hyperthermia Hollow Carbon Nanozyme as Pyroptosis Inducer for Boosted Antitumor Immunity.",
        "AbstractText": "The immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) antibody immunotherapy has demonstrated clinical benefits for multiple cancers. However, the efficacy of immunotherapy in tumors is suppressed by deficient tumor immunogenicity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, can release tumor antigens, activate effective tumor immunogenicity, and improve the efficiency of ICB, but efficient pyroptosis for tumor treatment is currently limited. Herein, we show a mild hyperthermia-enhanced pyroptosis-mediated immunotherapy based on hollow carbon nanozyme, which can specifically amplify oxidative stress-triggered pyroptosis and synchronously magnify pyroptosis-mediated anticancer responses in the tumor microenvironment. The hollow carbon sphere modified with iron and copper atoms (HCS-FeCu) with multiple enzyme-mimicking activities has been engineered to induce cell pyroptosis via the radical oxygen species (ROS)-Tom20-Bax-Caspase 3-gasdermin E (GSDME) signaling pathway under light activation. Both in vitro and in vivo antineoplastic results confirm the superiority of HCS-FeCu nanozyme-induced pyroptosis. Moreover, the mild photothermal-activated pyroptosis combining anti-PD-1 can enhance antitumor immunotherapy. Theoretical calculations further indicate that the mild photothermal stimulation generates high-energy electrons and enhances the interaction between the HCS-FeCu surface and adsorbed oxygen, facilitating molecular oxygen activation, which improves the ROS production efficiency. This work presents an approach that effectively transforms immunologically \"cold\" tumors into \"hot\" ones, with significant implications for clinical immunotherapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Hereditary forms of Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) are rare. Different phenotypes with the same mutation may be due to differences in the timing of RET activation steps, additional mutations in other regions of the gene, or the co-occurrence of germline and somatic mutations, which is an infrequent possibility. Here, we aim to present the different features and difficulties in the follow-up of three family members with the same germline mutation. A 4-year-old male patient with respiratory distress was diagnosed with MTC and found to have a heterozygous germline mutation C.2671T>G(S891A) in the RET gene (classified as intermediate risk according to ATA). As the tumor was inoperable, treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sorafenib) was initiated. Sorafenib has prevented tumor progression for seven years. Whole exome sequencing (WES) did not identify additional mutations. Segregation analysis showed the same mutation in the asymptomatic mother and sister. In our case, thyroid tissues were examined for somatic mutations, and SDHA c.1223C>T (p.S408L) was found. The clinical presentation of rare mutations such as RET p.S891A differed among family members carrying the same germline mutation. Our index case's more severe clinical presentation may be due to an additional somatic mutation. Sorafenib treatment can be an option for advanced MTC and may prevent disease progression.",

        "AbstractText": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a major contributor to cancer-related deaths and is characterized by high heterogeneity in epidemiology and histopathology worldwide. Increasing evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play multifaceted roles in cellular processes in human cancers. Here, we demonstrated that circFNTA high expression increases the proliferation, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and tumorigenicity of GC cells. First, we found that circFNTA was upregulated in GC cells and tissues, and the high circFNTA levels were positively associated with the poor prognosis in GC patients. Using luciferase reporter and RNA-pull down assays, we elucidated that circFNTA sponged two microRNAs, miR-604 and miR-647. In addition, the proliferation and metastatic ability of GC cell reduction caused by silencing circFNTA was hindered by inhibitors of miR-604 and miR-647. Moreover, SCN8A was predicted by miRDB as a common target gene of miR-604 and miR-647, which was then verified by the luciferase reporter assay. Knockdown of circFNTA causes messenger RNA and protein levels in SCN8A to be downregulated in GC cells. However, this effect was overturned by cotransfection miR-604 and miR-647. Also, we identified that SCN8A was downregulated in GC tissues, which was positively correlated with circFNTA expression. In rescue experiments, the attenuated cell proliferation and metastatic ability caused by circFNTA knockdown was reversed by miR-604 and miR-647 inhibitors and SCN8A overexpression. Collectively, our findings suggest an oncogenic role of circFNTA in GC progression and elucidate that circFNTA exerts its function by modulating the miR-604/miR-647/SCN8A axis.",

However, the current methods predominantly rely on a single-positive marker and are susceptible to interference from soluble proteins or impurities. This limitation represents a significant obstacle to the widespread application of EVs in biological research. Herein, we propose a novel approach that utilizes proximity ligation assay (PLA) and DNA-RNA hybridization to facilitate the binding of two proteins on the EV membrane in advance enabling the isolation and enrichment of intact EVs with double-positive membrane proteins followed by using functionalized magnetic beads for capture and enzymatic cleavage for isolated EVs release. The isolated subpopulations of EVs can be further utilized for cellular uptake studies, high-throughput small RNA sequencing, and breast cancer diagnosis. Hence, developing and implementing a specialized system for isolating and enriching a specific subpopulation of extracellular vesicles can enhance basic and clinical research in this field.

Previous research studies mainly focused on the tumor-specific recruitment capability or drug carriers based on subcutaneous tumor models. In clinical trials, orthotopic tumor models are considered more clinically relevant and better predictive models for assessing drug efficacy compared to standard subcutaneous models. Here, we first prepared uniform-sized NBs with a soft chitosan-lipid membrane containing perfluoropropane gas and then anti-VEGFR2 antibodies were incorporated into NB membranes in order to achieve targeting ability toward tumor angiogenesis. The results of physicochemical characterization (the average size of 260.9 \u00b1 3.3 nm and a PDI of 0.168 \u00b1 0.036, n = 3) indicated that the targeted nanobubbles (tNBsv) have a spherical morphology and a vacant core. In vitro experiments found that the contrast enhancement abilities of tNBsv are similar to those of commercial SonoVue. In in vivo experiments, the orthotopic model of the rabbit VX2 hepatic tumor was used to evaluate the targeted binding ability of tNBsv toward tumor angiogenesis. Ultrasound sonograms revealed that tNBsv achieved the peak intensity of ultrasound imaging enhancement in the region of peripheral vasculature of VX2 tumors over non-targeted NBs or SonoVue, and the imaging time was longer than that of the other two. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging and examination using a confocal laser scanning microscope further verified that tNBsv were capable of binding to tumor angiogenesis. These results from our studies suggested that tNBsv are useful to develop an ultrasound imaging probe to evaluate anti-angiogenic cancer therapy by monitoring tumor angiogenesis.",

        "AbstractText": "In tandem with the expanding obesity pandemic, the prevalence of metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as NASH)- driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is predicted to rise globally, creating a significant need for therapeutic interventions. We previously identified the upregulation of apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor (AATF), which is implicated in facilitating the progression from MASH to HCC. The objective of this study was to examine whether the intervention of curcumin could alleviate AATF-mediated MASH, inhibit tumor growth, and elucidate the underlying mechanism. A preclinical murine model mimicking human MASH-HCC was employed, subjecting mice to either a chow diet normal water (CDNW) or western diet sugar water (WDSW) along with very low dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 - 0.2\u2009\u03bcL/g, weekly). Mice receiving curcumin (CUR) alongside WDSW/CCl4 exhibited significant improvements, including reduced liver enzymes, dyslipidemia, steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning. Curcumin treatment also suppressed hepatic expression of inflammatory, fibrogenic, and oncogenic markers. Of note, there was a significant reduction in the expression of AATF upon curcumin treatment in WDSW/CCl4 mice and human HCC cells. In contrast, curcumin upregulated Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in MASH liver and HCC cells, which is known to downregulate sp1 (specificity protein-1) expression. Thus, curcumin treatment effectively inhibited the progression of MASH to HCC by downregulating the expression of AATF via the KLF4-Sp1 signaling pathway. These preclinical findings establish a novel molecular connection between curcumin and AATF in reducing hepatocarcinogenesis, and provide a strong rationale for the development of curcumin as a viable treatment for MASH-HCC in humans.",

Since the NRP2 pathway activation is thought to occur in part through secondary resistance, quantification of NRP2 in initial tissue biopsy specimens collected at diagnosis may have limited utility in identifying patients at highest risk for morbidity and mortality. Given that metastatic tissue is only occasionally obtained for analysis, there is a need for development of a plasma biomarker indicative of NRP2 pathway activation to potentially inform prostate cancer prognosis. Therefore, we investigated if plasma levels of NRP2 or vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), a known soluble ligand of NRP2, are prognostic for prostate cancer. We hypothesized that plasma NRP2 and VEGF-C would be associated with more advanced disease or relapsed disease. NRP2 and VEGF-C levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassay in plasma samples obtained from 145 prostate cancer patients in an opportunistic biobank. These patients were either (1) newly diagnosed (N\u2009=\u200928), (2) in remission (N\u2009=\u200956), or (3) relapsed disease (N\u2009=\u200961).

Neither NRP2 nor VEGF-C levels were significantly different in cancer patients compared to noncancer controls. We observed no clear association between plasma NRP2 and disease severity. Increased plasma VEGF-C was significantly associated with disease remission and correlated with Stage I/II and intermediate-risk Gleason score. Neither NRP2 nor VEGF-C correlated with PSA level. Although tissue NRP2 expression correlates with severe disease, this was not observed for plasma NRP2. Plasma NRP2 levels did not correlate with disease severity or relapse.

        "AbstractText": "To explore the optimal laser settings and treatment strategies for Thulium Fiber Laser (TFL) lithotripsy with the highest treatment efficiency, lowest thermal injury risk, and shortest procedure time. An in-vitro kidney model was utilized to assess the efficacy of TFL lithotripsy. Stone ablation experiments were performed on BegoStone phantoms at different combinations of pulse energy (EP ) and frequency (F) to determine the optimal settings. Temperature changes and thermal injury risks were monitored using embedded thermocouples. Experiments were also performed on calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) stones to validate the optimal settings. High EP /low F settings demonstrated superior treatment efficiency compared to low EP /high F settings under the same power. Specifically, the optimal settings of 0.8 J/12 Hz resulted in a two-fold increase in treatment efficiency, 39% reduction in energy expenditure per unit of ablated stone mass, 35% reduction in residual fragments, and 36% reduction in total procedure time compared to the 0.2 J/50 Hz for COM stones. Thermal injury risk assessment indicated that 10 W settings with high EP /low F combinations remained below the threshold for tissue injury, while higher power settings (>\u200910 W) consistently exceeded the safety threshold. Our findings suggest that high EP /low F settings, such as 0.8 J/12 Hz, are optimal for TFL lithotripsy in the treatment of COM stones. These settings demonstrated significantly improved treatment efficiency with reduced residual fragments compared to conventional settings while keeping the thermal dose below the injury threshold. This study highlights the importance of using high EP /low F in low power settings, which maximize treatment efficiency and minimizes potential thermal injury. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal settings of TFL for treating kidney stones with different compositions.",

        "AbstractText": "Introduction: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the etiological agent of cervical cancer, which remains the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. K14-HPV16 transgenic mice are a model for HPV-induced cancers, which undergo multistep squamous carcinogenesis at the skin, that is histologically and molecularly similar to carcinogenesis of the human cervix. Previous screens of differentially regulated microRNAs (miRs) using K14-HPV16 mice showed a role for miR-21, miR-155, miR-150, miR-146a, miR-125b and miR-223 during carcinogenesis. Methods: We now aim to translate these observations into the clinical setting, using data provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to explore whether those microRNAs can influence the survival of cervical cancer patients. Results: Results showed that low miR-150, miR-155 and miR-146a expression levels in primary tumors were associated with poor overall survival. However, only miR-150 and miR-155 were found to be independent predictors, increasing the risk of death. When patients were stratified by clinical stage, low miR-150, miR-155, miR-146a and miR-125b were associated with poor survival for clinical stages I&II. Only low miR-150 expression increased the death risk. Conclusion: We conclude that miR-150 and miR-155 may be potentially applied as prognostic biomarkers in cervical cancer patients. However, further investigation is required to determine their applicability.",

We aimed to perform an overview of the evidence quality of SRs/MAs of acupuncture for improving cancer pain. 8 databases were systematically searched to identify SRs/MAs of acupuncture for improving cancer pain. The A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS), Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), respectively, were applied by 2 independent reviewers to evaluate the methodological quality, risk of bias, reporting quality, and evidence quality. A total of 14 SRs/MAs were included in the present study. By AMSTAR-2, two reviews were rated as having high methodological quality, while 12 were given a critically low rating. All SRs/MAs in Phase 1, Domain 1, and Domain 4, according to ROBIS, were at low risk. Furthermore, 4 reviews in Domain 2, twelve reviews in Domain 3, and ten SRs/MAs in Phase 3, were rated as having low risk of bias. With reporting quality, some reporting flaws were identified in the topic of protocol and registration, additional analyses, and search strategy. According to GRADE, the level of evidence quality was \"critically low\" to \"moderate,\" and risk of bias was the most common downgraded factor. Acupuncture may be beneficial in improving cancer pain.

        "AbstractText": "The increased risk of breast cancer metastasis is closely linked to the effects of platelets. Our previously light-switchable diphtheria toxin A fragment (DTA) gene system, known as the LightOn system, has demonstrated significant therapeutic potential; it lacks antimetastatic capabilities. In this study, we devised an innovative system by combining cell membrane fusion liposomes (CML) loaded with the light-switchable transgene DTA (pDTA) and a ticagrelor (Tig) prodrug. This innovative system, named the sequential rocket-mode bioactivating drug delivery system (pDTA-Tig@CML), aims to achieve targeted pDTA delivery while concurrently inhibiting platelet activity through the sequential release of Tig triggered by reactive oxygen species with the tumor microenvironment. In vitro investigations have indicated that pDTA-Tig@CML, with its ability to sequentially release Tig and pDTA, effectively suppresses platelet activity, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes and the mitigation of platelet driven metastasis in breast cancer. Furthermore, pDTA-Tig@CML exhibits enhanced tumor aggregation and successfully restrains tumor growth and metastasis. It also reduces the levels of ADP, ATP, TGF-\u03b2, and P-selectin both in vitro and in vivo, underscoring the advantages of combining the bioactivating Tig prodrug nanoplatform with the LightOn system. Consequently, pDTA-Tig@CML emerges as a promising light-switchable DTA transgene system, offering a novel bioactivating prodrug platform for breast cancer treatment.",

Thirty-one inpatients aged 70\u2009years or older participated in this study. Grip and knee extensor strength, 6-minute walking test, body composition, nutritional status, fatigue and health-related QOL at admission and discharge were compared. In addition, the patients were classified into sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups, and a comparison between admission and discharge and 2-way ANOVA were performed. Overall, grip strength and skeletal muscle mass were significantly lower at discharge than at admission (P < .05); however, QOL significantly improved (P < .05). In the non-sarcopenia group, grip strength, right knee extension muscle strength, and skeletal muscle mass were all significantly lower at discharge than at admission (P < .05); however, this was not the case in the sarcopenia group. In terms of QOL, improvements were observed in different items in the non-sarcopenia and sarcopenia groups. There was a significant interaction between admission to discharge time period and sarcopenia regarding left grip strength, right knee extensor strength, and QOL. Exercise therapy is effective in improving QOL in older non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients undergoing inpatient chemotherapy. However, the effect of exercise therapy and optimal exercise load may differ between non-sarcopenia and sarcopenia patients. Therefore, it is necessary to consider exercise therapy in the future, taking into account the presence or absence of sarcopenia.",

        "AbstractText": "Glioma, a kind of malignant brain tumor, is extremely lethal. Kinesin family member 2C (KIF2C) was found to have an aberrant expression in several cancer types, including lung cancer and glioma. KIF2C may therefore be a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma. In the current study, new drug candidates that may function as KIF2C enzyme inhibitors were discovered. MTi OpenScreen was used to carry out the structure-based virtual screening of an inbuilt drug library containing 150,000 compounds. These compounds belong to different classes, such as natural product-based compounds (NP-lib), purchasable approved drugs (Drugs-lib), and food constituents compound collection (FOOD-lib). Based on their binding affinities, a total of 84 compounds were further pushed to calculate ADMET properties. The compounds (16) meeting the ADMET cutoff ranges were then further docked to the receptor to find their plausible binding modes using the Glide tool's standard precision (SP) technique. The docking results were examined using the Glide gscore, and the best binding compounds (Rimacalib and Sarizotan) were chosen to test their stability with KIF2C protein through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Similarly, Principal Component Analysis and cross-correlation matrix were also examined. The MM/GBSA binding free energies showed a considerable energy contribution in the binding of hits with the KIF2C. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest the potential of the lead compounds to inhibit the biological function of KIF2C, emphasizing the need for further investigation in this area.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

        "AbstractText": "Multiple drug resistance (MDR) is characterized by the resistance of cancer cells to a broad spectrum of anticancer drugs. The main mechanism underlying the MDR phenotype is the overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters by promoting active drug efflux from cancer cells. Some small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors have been found to overcome MDR by inhibiting ABC transporters as substrates or modulators. This study investigated the chemical activity of 58 FDA-approved anticancer kinase inhibitors against three multidrug resistance-related proteins. The studied proteins are ATP-Binding Cassette Sub-Family B Member 1 (ABCB1), ATP-Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 1 (ABCC1), and ATP-binding cassette superfamily G member 2 (ABCG2). The drug-binding domain and ATP binding sites of the proteins were considered the kinase inhibitors' probable target. High-throughput virtual screening and molecular docking were employed to find the hit drugs, and the drugs with the highest binding affinity were further evaluated using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The virtual screening revealed that several kinase inhibitors could be considered potential inhibitors of ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2, among which larotrectinib, entrectinib, and infigratinib showed the highest binding affinity, respectively. Based on the obtained results from MD simulation, these drugs can form strong interactions with the essential residues of the target proteins. In silico investigation revealed that larotrectinib, entrectinib, and infigratinib can target the key residues of the studied proteins. Therefore, these approved kinase inhibitors could be considered potential therapies for MDR cancers by targeting these transporters.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "AbstractText": "Despite the continuous advancement of surgical resection techniques, postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis remain a huge challenge. Here, we constructed an injectable curcumin/doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticle (NanoCD) hydrogel, which could effectively inhibit tumor regrowth and metastasis via reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for highly effective postsurgical cancer treatment. NanoCD was prepared by the controlled assembly of curcumin (CUR) and doxorubicin (DOX) via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonding in the presence of human serum albumin. To facilitate prolonged treatment of postsurgical tumors, NanoCD was further incorporated into the temperature-sensitive Poloxamer 407 gel (NanoCD@Gel) for intracavity administration. Mechanistically, DOX induced the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and CUR reduced the ROS metabolism by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). The synergy of DOX and CUR amplified intracellular ROS levels and thus resulted in enhanced immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells. Upon being injected into the tumor cavity after resection, the in situ-generated NanoCD@Gel allowed the local release of CUR and DOX in a controlled manner to induce local chemotherapy and persistently activate the antitumor immune response, thereby achieving enhanced immunogenic chemotherapy with reduced systemic toxicity. Our work provides an elegant strategy for persistently stimulating effective antitumor immunity to prevent postsurgical tumor recurrence and metastasis.",

        "AbstractText": "Radiation-induced heart damage caused by low-dose X-rays has a significant impact on tumour patients' prognosis, with cardiac hypertrophy being the most severe noncarcinogenic adverse effect. Our previous study demonstrated that mitophagy activation promoted cardiac hypertrophy, but the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. In the present study, PARL-IN-1 enhanced excessive hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and exacerbated mitochondrial damage.\u00a0Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification-based quantitative proteomics identified NDP52 as a crucial target mediating cardiac hypertrophy induced by low-dose X-rays. SUMOylation proteomics revealed that the SUMO E3 ligase MUL1 facilitated NDP52 SUMOylation through SUMO2. Co-IP coupled with LC-MS/MS identified a critical lysine residue at position 262 of NDP52 as the key site for SUMO2-mediated SUMOylation of NDP52. The point mutation plasmid NDP52K262R inhibited mitophagy under MUL1 overexpression, as evidenced by inhibition of LC3 interaction with NDP52, PINK1 and LAMP2A. A mitochondrial dissociation study revealed that NDP52K262R inhibited PINK1 targeting to endosomes early endosomal marker (EEA1), late/lysosome endosomal marker (LAMP2A) and recycling endosomal marker (RAB11), and laser confocal microscopy confirmed that NDP52K262R impaired the recruitment of mitochondria to the autophagic pathway through EEA1/RAB11 and ATG3, ATG5, ATG16L1\u00a0and STX17, but did not affect mitochondrial delivery to lysosomes via LAMP2A for degradation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that MUL1-mediated SUMOylation of NDP52 plays a crucial role in regulating mitophagy in the context of low-dose X-ray-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Two hundred sixty-second\u00a0lysine of NDP52 is identified as a key SUMOylation site for low-dose X-ray promoting mitophagy activation and cardiac hypertrophy.

From July 2018 to June 2020, paraffin-embedded CC specimens diagnosed in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were systematically collected and tested for HR-HPV DNA. Type-specific HR-HPV prevalence was compared according to HIV status. Of the 170 CC specimens analysed (median age 52\u2009years, interquartile range: [43.0-60.0]), 43 (25.3%) were from women living with HIV (WLHIV) with a median CD4 count of 526 [373-833] cells/mm3 and 86% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The overall HR-HPV prevalence was 89.4% [95% CI: 84.7-94.1]. All were single HR-HPV infections with no differences according to HIV status (P\u2009=\u2009.8).

Overexpression of Trip13 has been detected in many cancers and is associated with myeloma progression, disease relapse and poor prognosis inmultiple myeloma (MM). We have identified a small molecular, TI17, through a parallel compound-centric approach, which specifically targets Trip13. To identify whether TI17 targeted Trip13, pull-down and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) assays were performed. Cell counting kit-8, clone formation, apoptosis and cell cycle assays were applied to investigate the effects of TI17. We also utilized a mouse model to investigate the effects of TI17 in vivo. TI17 effectively inhibited the proliferation of MM cells, and induced the cycle arrest and apoptosis of MM cells. Furthermore, treatment with TI17 abrogates tumor growth and has no apparent side effects in mouse xenograft models. TI17 specifically impaired Trip13 function of DSBs repair and enhanced DNA damage responses in MM. Combining with melphalan or HDAC inhibitor panobinostat triggers synergistic anti-MM effect.

Furthermore, H2 Mab-77-mG2a -f demonstrated strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) for BT-474 cells. MDA-MB-468, a HER2-negative breast cancer cell line, was unaffected by H2 Mab-77-mG2a -f. Additionally, in the BT-474-bearing tumor xenograft model, H2 Mab-77-mG2a -f substantially suppressed tumor development when compared with the control mouse IgG2a mAb. In contrast, the HER2-negative MDA-MB-468-bearing tumor xenograft model showed no response to H2 Mab-77-mG2a -f. These findings point to the possibility of H2 Mab-77-mG2a -f as a treatment regimen by showing that it has antitumor effects on HER2-positive breast tumors.",

        "AbstractText": "Daratumumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Subcutaneous (SC) formulation proved to be non-inferior in comparison with intravenous (IV) administration route. This study aimed at assessing the economic and time impact associated with the use of SC versus IV daratumumab in patients with RRMM from the perspective of the hematology center. This was a 5-month multicenter time-and-motion cross-sectional micro-costing study conducted in three Italian hematology centers among adult patients diagnosed with RRMM with ongoing treatment with IV or SC daratumumab. Measurements were performed by an ad hoc App. Nineteen (20%) IV and 76 (80%) SC administration procedures were measured.

        "AbstractText": "The TP53 gene is estimated to be mutated in over 50% of tumors, with the majority of tumors exhibiting abnormal TP53 signaling pathways. However, the exploration of TP53 mutation-related LncRNAs in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains incomplete. This study aims to identify such LncRNAs and enhance the prognostic accuracy for Hepatoma patients. Differential gene expression was identified using the \"limma\" package in R. Prognosis-related LncRNAs were identified via univariate Cox regression analysis, while a prognostic model was crafted using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves. The precision of the prognostic model was assessed through ROC analysis. Subsequently, the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm were executed on the TCGA dataset via the TIDE database. Fractions of 24 types of immune cell infiltration were obtained from NCI Cancer Research Data Commons using deconvolution techniques. The protein expression levels encoded by specific genes were obtained through the TPCA database. In this research, we have identified 85 LncRNAs associated with TP53 mutations and developed a corresponding signature referred to as TP53MLncSig. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a lower 3-year survival rate in high-risk patients (46.9%) compared to low-risk patients (74.2%). The accuracy of the prognostic TP53MLncSig was further evaluated by calculating the area under the ROC curve. The analysis yielded a 5-year ROC score of 0.793, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, a higher score for TP53MLncSig was found to be associated with an increased response rate to immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy (p = .005). Patients possessing high-risk classification exhibited lower levels of P53 protein expression and higher levels of genomic instability. The present study aimed to identify and validate LncRNAs associated with TP53 mutations. We constructed a prognostic model that can predict chemosensitivity and response to ICB therapy in HCC patients. This novel approach sheds light on the role of LncRNAs in TP53 mutation and provides valuable resources for analyzing patient prognosis and treatment selection.",

        "AbstractText": "In cancer treatment, multi-target approach has paid attention to a reasonable strategy for the potential agents. We investigated whether (E)-2-methoxy-4-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl) prop-1-en-1-yl) phenol (MMPP) could exert an anticancer effect by dual-regulating VEGFR2 and PPAR\u03b3. MMPP showed modulating effects in TNBC type (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and luminal A type (MCF7) breast cancer cell lines. MMPP enhanced PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity and inhibited VEGFR2 phosphorylation. MMPP-induced signaling by VEGFR2 and PPAR\u03b3 ultimately triggered the downregulation of AKT activity. MMPP exhibited anticancer effects, as evidenced by growth inhibition, inducement of apoptosis, and suppression of migration and invasion. At the molecular level, MMPP activated pro-apoptotic proteins (caspase3, caspase8, caspase9, and bax), while inhibiting the anti-apoptotic proteins (bcl2). Additionally, MMPP inhibited the mRNA expressions of EMT-promoting transcription factors. Therefore, our findings showed molecular mechanisms of MMPP by regulating VEGFR2 and PPAR\u03b3, and suggested that MMPP has potential to treat breast cancer.",

This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of CEA expression and corresponding clinical features to improve prognostic assessments. In CRC cells, hypomethylation of the CEACAM5 promoter enhanced CEA expression in HCT116 and HT29 cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) treatment. Our clinical data indicated that 64.7% (101/156) of CRC patients had an sCEA level above the normal range, and 76.2% (77/101) of those patients showed a lower average CpG methylation level of the CEACAM5 promoter. The methylation analysis showed that both CRC cell lines and patient samples shared the same critical methylation CpG regions at -200\u2009to\u2009-500 and -1000\u2009to\u2009-1400\u2009bp of the CEACAM5 promoter. Patients with hypermethylation of the CEACAM5 promoter showed features of a BRAF mutation, TGFB2 mutation, microsatellite instability-high, and preference for right-sided colorectal cancer and peritoneal seeding presentation that had a similar clinical character to the consensus molecular subtype 1 (CMS1) of colorectal cancer. Additionally, hypermethylation of the CEACAM5 promoter combined with evaluated sCEA demonstrated the worst survival among the patients. Therefore, the methylation status of the CEACAM5 promoter also served as an effective biomarker for assessing disease prognosis. Results indicated that DNA methylation is a major regulatory mechanism for CEA expression in colorectal cancer. Moreover, our data also highlighted that patients in a subgroup who escaped from inactivation by DNA methylation had distinct clinical and pathological features and the worst survival.",

We intend to explore how miR-597-5p influences the growth and development of CAC. In order to construct a CAC model, mice were stimulated with azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The in situ hybridization (ISH) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for the detection of miR-597-5p expression. The protein expression of CXCL5 was determined by western blotting, immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). The histologic colitis score and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining were used to evaluate degree of damage to colonic tissues. The proportion of macrophages detected in colon tumors was also measured using flow cytometry. The transwell test was employed to assess macrophage migration. It was found that the miR-597-5p and its target CXCL5 had a negative correlation. MiR-597-5p expression was decreased, while CXCL5 expression was raised in CAC tissues. In AOM/DSS-induced mice, miR-597-5p deficiency in intestinal epithelial cells resulted in decreasing colon length as well as increasing tumor numbers and histologic colitis score, which was reversed by CXCL5 inhibition. MiR-597-5p deficiency facilitated macrophage recruitment in AOM/DSS-induced mice and promoted macrophage migration in vitro, which were reversed by CXCL5 inhibition. Deficiency of miR-597-5p aggravated macrophage recruitment and tumorigenesis in a mouse CAC model, suggesting that miR-597-5p agonists may have an anti-inflammatory therapeutic effect in inflammatory bowel diseases and reduce the risk of developing CAC.",

Previous studies showed that microRNA-22 (miR-22) has altered expression level in multiple leukemia subtypes, which is associated with the survival outcomes of leukemia. Methods: According to the constituted retrieval strategy, eligible studies were included from January 2010 to November 2022 by searching database. The pooled Risk Ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to study the relationship between miR-22 and survival. Stata12.0 was used for meta-analysis. Differential expression analysis was conducted based on expression profile of miRNA. Results: Four English articles were included containing a total of 215 leukemia patients. Data showed that the pooled RR for overall survival (OS) was 1.558 (95% CI: 1.197-2.028, P\u2009<\u2009.01).

This study explored real-world patterns of opioid use among patients with HM. This retrospective cohort study identified adults diagnosed with HM from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2019 using the Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database. Across several HM types, we described rates of high-risk opioid use (based on Pharmacy Quality Alliance measures) and opioid-related harms, including incident opioid use disorder (OUD) diagnoses and opioid-related hospitalizations or emergency department (ED) visits. We used multivariable Cox regression to generate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing the risk of opioid-related harms between patients with versus without high-risk opioid use. Our sample included 43,190 patients with HM. Median age at HM diagnosis was 54 years (interquartile range\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u200944-60). Most patients (61.9%) were diagnosed with lymphoma. Approximately half (49.2%) had an opioid dispensed in the follow-up period.

Prior mammograms did not affect sensitivity [with priors: 62-86% (mean = 73.3%); without priors: 69.4-87.4% (mean = 75.8%)] and cancer detection rate, but increased specificity [with priors: 72-96% (mean = 87.5%); without priors: 63-87% (mean = 80.5%)] and reduced false-positive rates [with priors: 3.7 to 36% (mean = 19.9%); without priors 13.3-49% (mean = 31.4%)], recall rates [with priors: 3.8-57% (mean = 26.6%); without priors: [4.9%-67.5% (mean = 37.9%)], and abnormal interpretation rate decreased by 4% with priors. Evidence for the associations between the availability of prior mammograms and positive-predictive value, area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and localisation ROC AUC, and positive-predictive value of recall is limited and unclear.

A narrative review of the publications of the Nordic Cochrane Review of mammographic screening (NCR), the Swedish Two-County Trial (S2C) and the Canadian National Breast Screening Study 1 and 2 (CNBSS-1 and CNBSS-2). The NCR concluded that the S2C was unreliable, despite the review's complaints being shown to be mistaken, by direct reference to the original primary publications of the S2C. Repeated concerns were expressed by others about potential subversion of randomisation in CNBSS-1 and CNBSS-2; however, the NCR continued to rely heavily on the results of these trials. Since 2022, however, eyewitness evidence of such subversion has been in the public domain. An over-reliance on nominal satisfaction of checklists of criteria in systematic reviewing can lead to erroneous conclusions. This occurred in the case of the NCR, which concluded that mammographic screening was ineffective or minimally effective. Broader and more even-handed reviews of the evidence show that screening confers a substantial reduction in breast cancer mortality. Those carrying out systematic reviews should be aware of the dangers of over-reliance on checklists and guidelines. Readers of systematic reviews should be aware that a systematic review is just another study, with the capability that all studies have of coming to incorrect conclusions.

For these reasons, the standard of care for these patients is represented by a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In this view, searching for novel biomarkers that might help both in diagnosis and therapy is mandatory. In the last 30\u00a0years it was demonstrated that different families of ion channels are overexpressed in both lung cancer cell lines and primary tumours. The altered ion channel profile may be advantageous for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes since most of them are localised on the plasma membrane thus their detection is quite easy, as well as their block with specific drugs and antibodies. This review focuses on ion channels (Potassium, Sodium, Calcium, Chloride, Anion and Nicotinic Acetylcholine receptors) in lung cancer (both Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Small Cell Lung Cancer) and recapitulate the up-to-date knowledge about their role and clinical relevance for a potential use in the clinical setting, for lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Recurrent metastasis after radical resection in patients of colorectal cancer (CRC) is a great challenge for the world, in which genomic alterations play a major role in tumorigenesis. MUC4 plays a significant role in recurrence and metastasis in tumor. This study is aimed at exploring the association between MUC4 variants and metastatic recurrence of CRC. Forty-seven patients relapsing with metastasis and 37 patients remaining disease-free postoperatively were enrolled. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected mutations. Mutation and mRNA expression data were downloaded from TCGA and cBioPortal databases. We analyzed the relationship between MUC4 variants and clinical parameters, as well as possible molecular mechanisms. MUC4 variants rs56359992 and rs781124621 were associated with survival in patients with CRC. Rs56359992 was more common in patients with metastatic recurrence. MAPK pathway, PI3K-Akt pathway, JAK-STAT pathway, cell cycle, WNT pathway and mTOR pathway were found to correlate with MUC4 mutation by GO/KEGG analysis, as well as resting and activated mast cell related to MUC4 mutation by CIBERSORT analysis. Genetic variants of MUC4 with CRC may constitute a molecular signature of metastatic recurrence. MUC4 may become a new target for the treatment of CRC recurrence.",

        "AbstractText": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a group of cancers with poor prognosis. The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can identify important genes involved in cancer development and progression from a broader perspective. The scRNA-seq data and bulk RNA-seq data of LUAD were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Analyzing scRNA-seq for core cells in the GSE131907 dataset, and the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was used for dimensionality reduction and cluster identification. Macrophage polarization-associated subtypes were acquired from the TCGA-LUAD dataset after analysis, followed by further identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the TCGA-LUAD dataset (normal/LUAD tissue samples, two subtypes). Venn diagrams were utilized to visualize differentially expressed and highly variable macrophage polarization-related genes. Subsequently, a prognostic risk model for LUAD patients was constructed by univariate Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and the model was investigated for stability in the external data GSE72094. After analyzing the correlation between the trait genes and significantly mutated genes, the immune infiltration between the high/low-risk groups was then examined. The Monocle package was applied to analyze the pseudo-temporal trajectory analysis of different cell clusters in macrophage clusters. Subsequently, cell clusters of data macrophages were selected as key cell clusters to explore the role of characteristic genes in different cell populations and to identify transcription factors (TFs) that affect signature genes. Finally, qPCR were employed to validate the expression levels of prognosis signature genes in LUAD. 424 macrophage highly variable genes, 3920 DEGs, and 9561 DEGs were obtained from macrophage clusters, the macrophage polarization-related subtypes, and normal/LUAD tissue samples, respectively. Twenty-eight differentially expressed and highly mutated MPRGs were obtained. A prognostic risk model with 7 DE-MPRGs (RGS13, ADRB2, DDIT4, MS4A2, ALDH2, CTSH, and PKM) was constructed. This prognostic model still has a good prediction effect in the GSE72094 dataset. ZNF536 and DNAH9 were mutated in the low-risk group, while COL11A1 was mutated in the high-risk group, and they were highly correlated with the characteristic genes. A total of 11 immune cells were significantly different in the high/low-risk groups. Five cell types were again identified in the macrophage cluster, and then NK cells: CD56hiCD62L+ differentiated earlier and were present mainly on 2 branches. While macrophages were present on 2 branches and differentiated later. It was found that the expression levels of BCLAF1 and MAX were higher in cluster 1, which might be the TFs affecting the expression of the characteristic genes. Moreover, qPCR confirmed that the expression of the prognosis genes was generally consistent with the results of the bioinformatic analysis. Seven MPRGs (RGS13, ADRB2, DDIT4, MS4A2, ALDH2, CTSH, and PKM) were identified as prognostic genes for LUAD and revealed the mechanisms of MPRGs at the single-cell level.",

        "AbstractText": "Background and study aims The risk of developing total metachronous advanced neoplasia (TMAN) in patients with index serrated lesions (SL) or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) is unknown. We evaluated this risk in patients with either HGD, SL < 10 mm or SL \u2265 10 mm at index colonoscopy, who underwent surveillance colonoscopies. Patients and methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated all consecutive patients (n = 2477) diagnosed between 2010 and 2019 with colorectal HGD, SLs < 10 mm or SLs \u2265 10 mm. We excluded patients aged < 45 or > 75 years or those who had inflammatory bowel disease, hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndromes, previous or synchronous CRC, or no follow-up colonoscopy. Descriptive variables were compared using analysis of variance or Pearson chi-squared tests. Multivariate Cox regressions were used to compare the risk of TMAN between the HGD, SL < 10 mm and SL \u2265 10 mm groups. Results Overall, 585 patients (mean age 63 years; 55% male; mean follow-up 3.67 years) were included (226 with SLs < 10 mm, 204 with SLs \u2265 10 mm, 155 with HGD). Compared with SLs < 10 mm, patients with HGD did not have a significantly different rate of TMAN (HR=0.75 [0.39-1.44]) and patients with SLs \u2265 10 mm had a higher rate of TMAN (HR=2.08 [1.38-3.15]). Compared with HGD, patients with SLs \u2265 10 mm had a higher rate of TMAN (HR=1.87 [1.04-3.36]). Conclusions The risk for TMAN was higher for patients with SLs \u2265 10 mm than with HGD or SLs < 10 mm. This risk should be considered when planning surveillance intervals for patients diagnosed with large SLs.",

However, this strategy still faces challenges, including the limited therapeutic efficacy of cancer vaccines and immune-related adverse events associated with systematic delivery of ICIs. Herein, we demonstrate the antitumor immune response induced by outer membrane vesicle from Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk-OMV), which exhibites a favorable safety profile, highlighting the potential application as a natural and biocompatible self-adjuvanting vesicle. Utilizing tumor cell-derived exosome as an antigen source and Akk-OMV as a natural adjuvant, we construct a cancer vaccine formulation of extracellular vesicles hybrid lipid nanovesicles (Lipo@HEV) for enhanced prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination by promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation in lymph node and activating cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response. The Lipo@HEV is further loaded with plasmid to enable gene therapy-mediated PD-L1 blockade upon peritumoral injection. Meanwhile, it penetrates into lymph node to initiate DC maturation and CTL activation, synergistically inhibiting the established tumor. The fabrication of extracellular vesicles hybrid plasmid-loaded lipid nanovesicles reveals a promising gene therapy-guided and vesicle-based hybrid system for therapeutic cancer vaccination and synergistic immunotherapy strategy.",

A negative SLN accurately indicates the absence of metastases in the other regional lymph nodes (LN), thus avoiding unnecessary lymph nodal dissection. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid carcinoma (TC) with cervical LN metastases at diagnosis in 20-90%, and nodal involvement correlates with local persistence/recurrence. The SLN in PTC is an intraoperative method for staging preoperative N0 patients and for detecting metastatic LNs \"in and outside\" the cervical LN central compartment; it represents an alternative method to prophylactic central neck node dissection. In this review we summarize different methods and results of the use of SLN in TC. The SLN identification techniques currently used include the selective vital-dye (VD) method, 99mTc-nanocolloid planar lymphoscintigraphy with intraoperative use of a hand-held gamma probe (LS), the combination LS\u2009+\u2009VD, and the combination LS and preoperative SPECT-CT (LS\u2009+\u2009SPECT/CT).

Meanwhile, non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in children had limited treatment efficacy. Hence, we developed and validated a simple clinical scoring system for predicting outcomes in non-APL pediatric patients with AML. A total of 184 non-APL pediatric patients with AML who were admitted to our hospital and an independent dataset (318 patients) from the TARGET database were included. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) and Cox regression analysis were used to identify prognostic factors. Then, a nomogram score was developed to predict the 1, 3, and 5\u2009years overall survival (OS) based on their clinical characteristics and fusion genes. The accuracy of the nomogram score was determined by calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Additionally, an internal verification cohort was used to assess its applicability. Based on Cox and LASSO regression analyses, a nomogram score was constructed using clinical characteristics and OS-related fusion genes (CBF\u03b2::MYH11, RUNX1::RUNX1T1, KMT2A::ELL, and KMT2A::MLLT10), yielded good calibration and concordance for predicting OS of non-APL pediatric patients with AML. Furthermore, patients with higher scores exhibited worse outcomes. The nomogram score also demonstrated good discrimination and calibration in the whole cohort and internal validation. Furthermore, artificial neural networks demonstrated that this nomogram score exhibits good predictive performance. Our model based on the fusion gene is a prognostic biomarker for non-APL pediatric patients with AML.

The purpose of this study was to define whether there is any clinical impact on the occurrence of ischemic and hemorrhagic events in patients with AHREs and initiation of oral anticoagulation (OAC). Methodology Patients with AHREs who had received cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs, i.e., dual-chamber pacemaker [PM] or implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD])\u00a0were included in the study. OAC initiation was decided by the assistant doctor. Patients who received OACs comprised the OAC group, while patients who were not referred for OAC initiation were included in the control group. The primary endpoint was the time to the event of the occurrence of thromboembolic events (thromboembolic event-free survival). Results A total of 154 individuals (77 in each group) were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 72.5 years. The mean follow-up period for the OAC group was 19.1 months and for the control group, 18.9 months (P =\u00a00.9). Thromboembolic events were noticed only in seven patients.

Conclusions OAC therapy in patients with AHREs was not associated with a significant difference in the risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events. Baseline patient characteristics and AHRE duration may be useful to intensify the monitoring and management of patients with AHREs.

As the introduction of CDK4/6 inhibitors into the treatment of early-stage breast cancer with a higher risk of recurrence will probably result in a shift in the endocrine treatment landscape, the question is what treatment did potential candidates for CDK4/6 inhibitors in Germany receive before CDK4/6 inhibitors were available. As part of a retrospective multicenter analysis, anonymized data were collected of patients with HR+ HER2- early-stage breast cancer who received endocrine therapy in the period between 10/2021 and 03/2022. Potential candidates for CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment were classified into different risk cohorts using the inclusion criteria of the NATALEE and monarchE trials. The data of 238 patients from 29 different centers were analyzed. While 20.6% of patients met the monarchE criteria, the subgroup which met the NATALEE inclusion criteria consisted of 46.2% of patients. 53.8% of patients did not meet the inclusion criteria for either the NATALEE or the monarchE trial.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is one of the major complications during the treatment course of cancer, which often challenges clinicians in daily clinical practice despite anticoagulation therapy. A 57-year-old man with a history of a liver transplantation was diagnosed with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. He developed severe systemic thromboses including a massive pulmonary embolism and was treated with anticoagulation therapy including a factor Xa inhibitor. However, the systemic thromboses worsened despite the anticoagulation therapy. During the acute treatment course of the thromboses, we administered anticancer drug therapy in hopes of an improvement in the activity of the cancer status leading to a favourable effect on the thrombosis status. Multi-disciplinary treatment including anticoagulation therapy and anticancer drug therapy successfully improved the systemic thrombosis. Anticoagulation therapy is a standard treatment for CAT; however, some cases of CAT do not successfully improve despite anticoagulation therapy, partly due to a highly active cancer status. Anticancer drug therapy might increase the risk of a thrombosis, whereas it could improve the activity of the cancer status leading to a decreased risk of a thrombosis. A multi-disciplinary therapy might be a reasonable option especially for CAT with a highly active cancer status.",

        "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized the therapy landscape of malignancy melanoma. However, the clinical benefits from this regimen remain limited, especially in tumors lacking infiltrated T cells (known as \"cold\" tumors). Nanoparticle-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) has demonstrated improved outcomes in the ablation of solid tumors by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) and reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, the combination of PTT and ICB is a promising regimen for patients with \"cold\" tumors. A second near-infrared (NIR-II) light-activated gold nanocomposite AuNC@SiO2@HA with AuNC as a kernel, silica as shell, and hyaluronic acid (HA) polymer as a targeting molecule, was synthesized for PTT. The fabricated AuNC@SiO2@HA nanocomposites underwent various in vitro studies to characterize their physicochemical properties, light absorption spectra, photothermal conversion ability, cellular uptake ability, and bioactivities. The synergistic effect of AuNC@SiO2@HA-mediated PTT and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was evaluated using a mouse model of immune \"cold\" melanoma. The tumor-infiltrating T cells were assessed by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the mechanism of AuNC@SiO2@HA-induced T-cell infiltration was investigated through immunochemistry staining of the ICD-related markers, including HSP70, CRT, and HMGB1. Finally, the safety of AuNC@SiO2@HA nanocomposites was evaluated in vivo. The AuNC@SiO2@HA nanocomposite with absorption covering 1064 nm was successfully synthesized. The nano-system can be effectively delivered into tumor cells, transform the optical energy into thermal energy upon laser irradiation, and induce tumor cell apoptosis in vitro. In an in vivo mouse melanoma model, AuNC@SiO2@HA nanocomposites significantly induced ICD and T-cell infiltration. The combination of AuNC@SiO2@HA and anti-PD-1 antibody synergistically inhibited tumor growth via stimulating robust T lymphocyte immune responses. The combination of AuNC@SiO2@HA-mediated PTT and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy proposed a neoteric strategy for oncotherapy, which efficiently convert the immune \"cold\" tumors into \"hot\" ones.",

Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) expression is crucial for antigen presentation and the host's response to SARS-CoV-2. To gain insights into the immune response and molecular pathways involved in severe lung disease, we performed immunopeptidomic and proteomic analyses of lung tissues recovered at four COVID-19 autopsy and six non-COVID-19 transplants. We found signals of tissue injury and regeneration in lung fibroblast and alveolar type I/II cells, resulting in the production of highly immunogenic self-antigens within the lungs of COVID-19 patients. We also identified immune activation of the M2c macrophage as the primary source of HLA-I presentation and immunogenicity in this context. Additionally, we identified 28 lung signatures that can serve as early plasma markers for predicting infection and severe COVID-19 disease. These protein signatures were predominantly expressed in macrophages and epithelial cells and were associated with complement and coagulation cascades. Our findings emphasize the significant role of macrophage-mediated immunity in the development of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.",

Within this study, performing analysis and humanization guided by the structures predicted by AlphaFold2.

The KD value of parental antibody 3D5-hIgG1 was increased by nearly 7 times after humanization. Both h3D5-hIgG1 and 3D5-hIgG1 bound to cells expressing human PD-L1 with EC50 values of 5.13 and 9.92nM, respectively. Humanization resulted in a twofold increase in the binding capacity of the antibody, with h3D5-hIgG1 exhibiting superior performance compared to the parental antibody 3D5-hIgG1. Furthermore, h3D5-hIgG1 promoted cytokine secretion of T cells, and significantly suppressed MC38-hPD-L1 tumor growth.

The 5-year survival rate for early-stage RCC is generally favorable; however, the prognosis takes a significant downturn when the tumor progresses to distant metastasis. Therefore, the identification of molecular markers for RCC is crucial in enhancing early diagnosis rates. Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle (EV) typically ranging in size from 30 nm to 150 nm, which contain RNA, DNA, proteins, lipids, etc. They can impact neighboring receptor cells through the autocrine or paracrine pathway, influence cellular communication, and regulate the local immune cells, consequently shaping the tumor immune microenvironment and closely associating with tumor development.

The phenotype and function of DC-CTLs and the immune status of patients were detected using flow cytometry or IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT analysis. DCs acquired a mature phenotype and expressed high levels of CD80, CD86, CD83, and HLA-DR after co-culture with peptides, and the DC-CTLs also exhibited high levels of IFN-\u03b3. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from post-treatment patients showed a stronger immune response to peptides than those prior to treatment. Importantly, four of five patients maintained a favorable immune status, of which one patient's disease-free survival lasted up to 28.2 months.

We hypothesized that increased heterozygosity at HLA loci is associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). We imputed HLA class I and II four-digit alleles using genotype data from a population-based study of 5,406 cases and 4,635 controls from the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Study (MECC). Heterozygosity at each HLA locus and the number of heterozygous genotypes at HLA class -I (A, B, and C) and HLA class -II loci (DQB1, DRB1, and DPB1) were quantified. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of CRC associated with HLA heterozygosity. Individuals with homozygous genotypes for all loci served as the reference category, and the analyses were adjusted for sex, age, genotyping platform, and ancestry. Further, we investigated associations between HLA diversity and tumor-associated T cell repertoire features, as measured by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs; N=2,839) and immunosequencing (N=2,357). Individuals with all heterozygous genotypes at all three class I genes had a reduced odds of CRC (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56-0.97, p= 0.031). A similar association was observed for class II loci, with an OR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60-0.95, p= 0.016). For class-I and class-II combined, individuals with all heterozygous genotypes had significantly lower odds of developing CRC (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87, p= 0.004) than those with 0 or one heterozygous genotype. HLA class I and/or II diversity was associated with higher T cell receptor (TCR) abundance and lower TCR clonality, but results were not statistically significant.

        "AbstractText": "In oncology, anti-drug antibody (ADA) development that significantly curtails response durability has not historically risen to a level of concern. The relevance and attention ascribed to ADAs in oncology clinical studies have therefore been limited, and the extant literature on this subject scarce. In recent years, T cell engagers have gained preeminence within the prolific field of cancer immunotherapy. These drugs whose mode of action is expected to potently stimulate anti-tumor immunity, may potentially induce ADAs as an unintended corollary due to an overall augmentation of the immune response. ADA formation is therefore emerging as an important determinant in the successful clinical development of such biologics. Here we describe the immunogenicity and its impact observed to pasotuxizumab (AMG 212), a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting bispecific T cell engager (BiTE\u00ae) molecule in NCT01723475, a first-in-human (FIH), multicenter, dose-escalation study in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To explain the disparity in ADA incidence observed between the SC and CIV arms of the study, we interrogated other patient and product-specific factors that may have explained the difference beyond the route of administration. Treatment-emergent ADAs (TE-ADA) developed in all subjects treated with at least 1 cycle of AMG 212 in the subcutaneous (SC) arm. These ADAs were neutralizing and resulted in profound exposure loss that was associated with contemporaneous reversal of initial Prostate Surface Antigen (PSA) responses, curtailing durability of PSA response in patients. Pivoting from SC to a continuous intravenous (CIV) administration route remarkably yielded no subjects developing ADA to AMG 212. Through a series of stepwise functional assays, our investigation revealed that alongside a more historically immunogenic route of administration, non-tolerant T cell epitopes within the AMG 212 amino acid sequence were likely driving the high-titer, sustained ADA response observed in the SC arm. These mechanistic insights into the AMG 212 ADA response underscore the importance of performing preclinical immunogenicity risk evaluation as well as advocate for continuous iteration to better our biologics.",

        "AbstractText": "Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) are superior in antigen cross-presentation and priming CD8+ T cell anti-tumor immunity and thus, are a target of high interest for cancer immunotherapy. Type I interferon (IFN) is a potent inducer of antigen cross-presentation, but, unfortunately, shows only modest results in the clinic given the short half-life and high toxicity of current type I IFN therapies, which limit IFN exposure in the tumor. CD8+ T cell immunity is dependent on IFN signaling in cDC1s and preclinical studies suggest targeting IFN directly to cDC1s may be sufficient to drive anti-tumor immunity. Here, we engineered an anti-XCR1 antibody (Ab) and IFN mutein (IFNmut) fusion protein (XCR1Ab-IFNmut) to determine whether systemic delivery could drive selective and sustained type I IFN signaling in cDC1s leading to anti-tumor activity and, in parallel, reduced systemic toxicity. We found that the XCR1Ab-IFNmut fusion specifically enhanced cDC1 activation in the tumor and spleen compared to an untargeted control IFN. However, multiple treatments with the XCR1Ab-IFNmut fusion resulted in robust anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and loss of drug exposure. Using other cDC1-targeting Ab-IFNmut fusions, we found that localizing IFN directly to cDC1s activates their ability to promote ADA responses, regardless of the cDC1 targeting antigen. The development of ADA remains a major hurdle in immunotherapy drug development and the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the development of ADA responses in humans is not well understood. Our results reveal a role of cDC1s in ADA generation and highlight the potential ADA challenges with targeting immunostimulatory agents to this cellular compartment.",

Second, pulmonary cytology should classify the type of pathologic process present. When a pulmonary nodule is characterized as malignant, it is of high importance to further classify the malignancy as to type, with non-small cell carcinomas being sub-divided into adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and other types of non-small cell carcinoma. The World Health Organization Reporting System for Lung Cytopathology (WHORSLC) provides an important framework for reporting and classifying material obtained by cytologic techniques, including sputum analysis, bronchial brushings, bronchial washings, and fine-needle aspiration. The system contains five categories for specimen reporting. Clinicians prefer definitive diagnoses separating specimens into definitively benign or definitively malignant categories. The WHORSLC recognizes that it is not invariably possible for cytopathologists to separate specimens into definitively benign or definitively malignant categories. The five categories of the WHORSLC recognize the spectrum of cytologic changes running from clearly benign to clearly malignant, which cytopathologists must place into diagnostically useful and reproduceable categories. The intermediate categories of \"atypical\" and \"suspicious for malignancy\" provide structured categories with stringent definitions, estimated malignancy risks, and suggested management and follow-up recommendations. In this way, the categories \"atypical\" and \"suspicious for malignancy\" aid in maintaining the high diagnostic accuracy of the \"benign\" and \"malignant\" categories.",

Although ABI3 had been found to modulate the advancement of diverse neoplasms, there is no comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of its effects. Methods: The transcriptomics data of neoplasm and normal tissues were retrieved from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal, and UCSC XENA database. To gather protein information for ABI3, Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and GeneMANIA websites were utilized. Additionally, Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) database was consulted to determine the primary cell types expressing ABI3 in cancer microenvironments. Univariate Cox regression approach was leveraged to evaluate ABI3's prognostic role across cancers. The Cbioportal and Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA) website were leveraged to scrutinize the genomic landscape information across cancers. TIMER2.0 was leveraged to probe the immune cell infiltrations associated with ABI3 across cancers. The associations of ABI3 with immune-related genes were analyzed through Spearman correlation method. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were utilized to search associated biological pathways. The CellMiner database and molecular docking were implemented to identify potential interactions between the ABI3 protein and specific anticarcinogen. Findings: ABI3 expression and its ability to predict prognosis varied distinct tumor, with particularly high expression observed in Tprolif cells and monocytes/macrophages. Copy number variation (CNV) and methylation negatively correlated with ABI3 expression in the majority of malignancies. Corresponding mutation survival analysis indicated that the mutation status of ABI3 was strongly connected to the prognosis of LGG patients. ABI3 expression was linked to immunotherapeutic biomarkers and response in cancers. ESTIMATE and immune infiltrations analyses presented ABI3 association with immunosuppression. ABI3 was significantly correlated with immunoregulators and immune-related pathways. Lastly, prospective ABI3-targeted drugs were filtered and docked to ABI3 protein. Interpretation: Our study reveals that ABI3 acts as a robust tumor biomarker. Its functions are vital that could inhibit ectopic metastasis of tumor cells and modulate cellular adhesion and migration.

The fate of microvesicles released during in vivo aging of RBCs and their interactions with circulating cells is hitherto unknown. Using SEC plus DEG isolation methods, we have found that human RBCs generate microvesicles with two distinct sizes, densities, and protein composition, identified by flow cytometry, and MRPS, and further validated by immune TEM. Furthermore, proteomic analysis revealed that RBC-derived microvesicles (RBC-MVs) are enriched in proteins with important functions in ion channel regulation, calcium homeostasis, and vesicular transport, such as of sorcin, stomatin, annexin A7, and RAB proteins.

What did the researchers do? \u2022\u2003We used the results of ORAL Surveillance, a long-term safety trial in people with RA. \u2003\u25cb\u2003In this study, people with RA were 50\u2009years or older and at high risk of a major cardiovascular event such as heart attack or stroke. \u2022\u2003For up to 6\u2009years, people took tofacitinib 5 or 10mg tablets two times a day or TNFi injections. \u2022\u2003We used statistical tests to examine the link between different levels of RA disease activity or inflammation and different adverse medical events, such as: \u2003\u25cb\u2003major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack, stroke, or death due to heart failure) \u2003\u25cb\u2003cancers \u2003\u25cb\u2003blood clots \u2003\u25cb\u2003infections \u2003\u25cb\u2003deaths. What did the researchers find? \u2022\u2003In people who took tofacitinib or TNFi: \u2003\u25cb\u2003People with active disease (those with RA symptoms) had a higher risk of infections that did not lead to hospitalization (nonserious infections) than people in remission (those with very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all). \u2003\u25cb\u2003People with active disease also had a slightly higher risk of major cardiovascular events and blood clots than those in remission. \u2003\u25cb\u2003Higher levels of inflammation led to increased risk of major cardiovascular events, cancers, blood clots, infections, and deaths. What do the findings mean? \u2022\u2003Active RA disease leads to higher risk of adverse medical events. \u2022\u2003The medication used (tofacitinib or TNFi) did not affect the link between levels of RA disease activity and adverse medical events. \u2022\u2003This study was limited by the low number of adverse medical events recorded.",

        "AbstractText": "Polycystic ovary syndrome is a low-grade inflammatory state with increased serum levels of TNF-\u03b1. The present study has compared the inflammatory responses to breast cancer cell lines in women with PCOS with healthy women. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from 50 women with PCOS and 50 healthy controls were cultured in the trans-well co-culture system. These cells were stimulated with two distinct breast cancer cell lines. The proliferation of PBMCs, CD3+CD8+T cell percentages, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) concentration were evaluated after 48 and 72 hours of incubation. TNF-\u03b1 concentration and the proliferation rate of PBMCs after 48 hours of incubation significantly increased in the PCOS group. However, after 72 hours, TNF-\u03b1 secretion significantly decreased in the PCOS group. The ability of PBMCs to produce TNF-\u03b1 decreased gradually in women with PCOS. When the effects of low-grade inflammation and endocrine conditions on the cells decrease, the inability of PBMCs to create an inflammatory response will be altered.",

        "AbstractText": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an invasive form of hematologic malignancies which results in the overproduction of myeloid cells in the bone marrow. Aberrant expression of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) which belong to small non-coding RNAs, play important roles in different cancer cells' progress. hsa- piR- 32877 is up-regulated in AML. Down regulation of hsa-piR-32877 by antisense LNA GapmeRs could be potential for suppression of myeloid cell proliferation and induce myeloid cell apoptosis. We have blocked the expression of hsa-piR-32877 by antisense LNA GapmeRs in human bone marrow blast cells, and the M-07e cell line. Samples were transfected with antisense LNA GapmeRs at 24, 48, and 72 hours. The Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to investigate the expression of hsa-piR-32877, CASP3, and CASP9. Both CASP3 and CASP9 play important roles in apoptosis. Cell proliferation was studied via CFSE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester) assay. Results showed that hsa-piR-32877 was down-regulated by antisense LNA GapmeRs in the patient and cell line samples. Also, after transfection, cell proliferation and apoptosis decreased and increased, respectively. Our data suggested that hsa-piR-32877 suppression may act as a novel therapeutic method for the inhibition of human leukemic cells proliferation in AML.",

        "AbstractText": "Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. Acute lymphoid leukaemia, also known as ALL, is regarded as one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Due to the rapid increase in various cancer cases and the development of resistance in cancer cells, it is necessary to identify novel lead molecules with more potent anticancer properties. There is a growing interest in using herbal products/analogs as multi-component agents (as anticancer agents and immunomodulators) for cancer treatment. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the anticancer and immunomodulatory activity of P19, an analog of parthenin in ALL. P19 was reported to exhibit anticancer efficacy by triggering apoptotic signaling events in human leukaemia HL-60 cells by significant NO production. In contrast to this finding, ROS and NO were not required for P19-mediated apoptosis in Raji cells. The mechanism of action of P19 was observed to be cancer cell lineage dependent. P19 demonstrated very effective anticancer properties against ALL (IC50 3\u00b5M). Molecular investigations revealed that P19 induced mitochondrion mediated apoptosis by Bax localization to mitochondria and enhanced cytosolic calcium in the cytoplasm. Further activation of the caspase 3, caspase 8 and PARP cleavage suggested the involvement of the caspase-mediated apoptosis. Anti-proliferative activity revealed the telomerase inhibition and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase after P19 treatment. Immunomodulatory effects of the P19 revealed the enhanced INF\u0263 and NO production in Jurkat and THP cells. Owing to its antiproliferative and immunomodulatory potential against leukemia cells P19 can further be explored as effective therapeutics against leukemia.",

Furthermore, the recurrence of cancer poses a significant challenge to the cure of cancer. Therefore, avenues are wanted to find novel therapies for cancer treatment and cancer recurrence. In this review, we have highlighted that lactoferrin (LF) and activated protein C (APC) carry enormous potential in cancer treatment. Studies have shown that the decreased level of APC and impaired function of APC are associated with cancer progression and cancer-related mortality. Moreover, APC plays an important role in preventing prothrombotic state-mediated cancer progression and deaths. LF can also inhibit the progression of cancer by controlling the generation of reactive oxygen species, triggering the apoptosis of cancer cells, arresting the cell cycle and hindering the angiogenesis process. Additionally, APC and LF could have the potential to inhibit neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formations which are involved in cancer progression and the reawakening of dormant cancer cells. Hence, in this review, the anticancer potential and mechanism of APC and LF along with their potential to mitigate inflammation and NETs-mediated cancer progression and recurrence has been discussed. Additionally, possible future strategies to develop effective and safe anticancer treatment using LF and APC have also been discussed in this review.",

        "AbstractText": "Asbestos-related diseases still represent a major public health problem all over the world. Among them, malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a poor-prognosis cancer, arising from the serosal lining of the pleura, pericardium and peritoneum, triggered by asbestos exposure. Literature data suggest the key role of iron metabolism in the coating process leading to the formation of asbestos bodies, considered to be both protective and harmful. Two sample sets of individuals were taken into consideration, both residing in Broni or neighboring cities (Northwestern Italy) where an asbestos cement factory was active between 1932 and 1993. The present study aims to compare the frequency of six SNPs involved in iron trafficking, previously found to be related to protection/predisposition to MM after asbestos exposure, between 48 male subjects with documented asbestos exposure who died of MM and 48 male subjects who were exposed to asbestos but did not develop MM or other neoplastic respiratory diseases (Non-Mesothelioma Asbestos Exposed - NMAE). The same analysis was performed on 76 healthy male controls. The allelic and genotypic frequencies of a sub-group of 107 healthy Italian individuals contained in the 1000 genomes database were considered for comparison. PCR-multiplex amplification followed by SNaPshot mini-sequencing reaction was used. The findings presented in this study show that the allelic and genotypic frequencies for six SNP markers involved in iron metabolism/homeostasis and the modulation of tumor microenvironment are not significantly different between the two sample sets of MM and NMAE. Therefore, the SNPs here considered do not seem to be useful markers for individual susceptibility to mesothelioma. This finding is not in agreement with previous literature.",

Although scholars have noted tourism's potential role in managing cognitive impairment and mild dementia, more robust empirical investigation is needed in this area. This study aimed to examine the associations between tourism and cognitive impairment and dementia in older Chinese adults. From a nationwide community-based cohort, 6,717 individuals aged \u226560 were recruited from 2011 to 2014, of whom 669 (9.96%) had had at least one tourism experience in the 2\u2009years prior to enrollment. All the participants were then prospectively followed up until 2018. The association between tourism and cognitive impairment was examined by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the effect of tourism experience on cognitive impairment and dementia. A total of 1,416 individuals were newly diagnosed with cognitive impairment and 139 individuals with dementia onset during follow-up. The incidence of cognitive impairment was significantly lower among participants with tourism experiences (316.94 per 10,000 person-years) than those without such experiences (552.38 per 10,000 person-years). Cox regression showed that tourism decreased the risk of cognitive impairment (aHR\u2009=\u20090.69, 95% CI: 0.41-0.62) when adjusted for behavioral covariates and characteristics. Compared with participants without tourism experiences, those with 1, 2, and \u22653 tourism experiences had a lower risk of cognitive impairment with the aHRs of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.52-0.99), 0.65 (0.42-1.01), and 0.68 (0.44-0.98), respectively. Tourism experiences also reduced participants' risk of dementia (aHR\u2009=\u20090.41, 95% CI: 0.19-0.89).

        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mainly develops from chronic hepatitis. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has gradually become the main pathogenic factor for HCC given the rising incidence of obesity and metabolic diseases. 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) degrades prostaglandin 2 (PGE2), which is known to exacerbate inflammatory responses. However, the role of PGE2 accumulation caused by 15-PGDH downregulation in the development of MASH-HCC has not been determined. We utilised the steric animal model to establish a MASH-HCC model using wild-type and 15-Pgdh+/- mice to assess the significance of PGE2 accumulation in the development of MASH-HCC. Additionally, we analysed clinical samples obtained from patients with MASH-HCC. PGE2 accumulation in the tumour microenvironment induced the production of reactive oxygen species in macrophages and the expression of cell growth-related genes and antiapoptotic genes. Conversely, the downregulation of fatty acid metabolism in the background liver promoted lipid accumulation in the tumour microenvironment, causing a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, which led to enhanced development of MASH-HCC. 15-PGDH downregulation inactivates immune surveillance by promoting the proliferation of exhausted effector T cells, which enhances hepatocyte survival and proliferation and leads to the development of MASH-HCC. The suppression of PGE2-related inflammation and subsequent lipid accumulation leads to a reduction in the severity of MASH and inhibition of subsequent progression toward MASH-HCC.",

        "AbstractText": "The MAKO Robotic-Arm system is a cutting-edge technology which combines both computed tomography (CT) scanning and three-dimensional planning to determine the ideal size and orientation of implants prior to bone resection. It is typically utilized within a general orthopedic setting for joint replacement procedures, such as total joint arthroplasties. However, its use within orthopedic oncology, which contains a much more compromised patient population and more complex surgical treatment, is not well documented within the literature. To determine the patient outcomes of those who underwent a total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at Morristown Medical Center using the MAKO Robotic-Arm System. Particularly, we aspired to delve into the use of the MAKO in an orthopedic oncology setting for patients with a degenerative hip or knee and a history of cancer or other orthopedic tumor, impending pathological fracture, PVNS, chondromatosis, radiation therapy, or other oncological related conditions. Our institution monitored twenty-five individuals with unique orthopedic oncology conditions that underwent MAKO robotic-assisted total hip and knee arthroplasty. This was performed between 2020 and 2022\u00a0at Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey. During this time period, 52% (13/25) of the operations were performed on knees and 48% (12/25) were performed on hips. Data regarding patient demographics, body mass index (BMI), medications, hemoglobin, hematocrit, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class, operative data, the length of stay (LOS), readmission rates due to infection or periprosthetic fractures, and complications were collected retrospectively. All confidence intervals were calculated at the 95% confidence level. Postoperatively, the average LOS was 3.2 days, and there were no complications after any of the MAKO-assisted joint arthroplasty procedures. Additionally, there were no readmissions at any of our recorded intervals - 1-30, 1-60, 1-90, and 1 year - however one patient presented to the emergency department after falling 4 days post-operatively. X-ray imaging ultimately revealed no periprosthetic fracture or malalignment of the prosthesis. The utilization of the MAKO Robotic-Arm System for joint arthroplasty procedures (THAs and TKAs) on orthopedic oncology patients yielded exceptional outcomes, with no complications or readmissions directly attributed to the use of this innovative robotic technology. Thus, this newly emerging surgical system holds great promise, potentially revolutionizing the approach for selected orthopedic oncology patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty compared to the traditional manual techniques. It further demonstrates that its use in an orthopedic oncology setting - where the cohort of patients are often compromised, leading to more intricate surgeries with heightened risks - elicits safety and provides optimal outcomes for patients. Nevertheless, its role within the field is evolving, and in the coming years, as it gains further popularity and sees broader application by orthopedic oncology surgeons, its potential will become clearer. To solidify its position, future clinical investigations and prospective research should be conducted to support the preference of the MAKO system over traditional manual techniques. This will help provide the necessary evidence to advocate for its widespread adoption and continued advancements in orthopedic oncology procedures.",

This was a retrospective study conducted at a rural tertiary care referral institute from July 2018 to June 2020. In each case, microphotographs were taken from 10 representative fields in H&E-stained sections for evaluating TSR in low-power and sTIL in high-power. Both the parameters were evaluated employing an indigenously designed square grid applied onto microphotographs in the power-point slides by making use of principles of the Pythagorean theorem. Both parameters were separately evaluated by two pathologists. Cohen kappa statistics was the statistical tool used to analyze inter-observer variability. Thirty cases were analyzed. Invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (IBC-NST) was the most common histopathological type (26 cases (86.67%)). For TRS evaluation, a Kappa value of 0.78 suggested substantial agreement with an agreement of 91.67%.

        "AbstractText": "Buschke-Lowenstein tumors (BLTs) are benign dermatologic manifestations of human papillomavirus (HPV). They originate from longstanding condylomata in individuals with compromised immune systems. In this case report, we present a 68-year-old immunocompetent female with HPV condylomata that had transitioned to a large, fungated BLT in her right groin. The patient's immunocompetency was determined by the absence of diabetes, corticosteroid therapy, organ transplant, cytotoxic therapy, or any known primary or other secondary immunodeficiencies. Notably, the patient had a history of breast cancer, managed through lumpectomy, local radiation, and two years of combined aromatase inhibitor and selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) therapy, followed by three years of further SERM therapy. We propose that the effect of her previously received SERM therapy shifted the T helper (Th)1 immune response to a Th2 response. This may have compromised the patient's HPV-specific cell-mediated immunity, favoring a non-protective Th2-dominant effect. Thus, it potentially enabled immune evasion, transitioning to a BLT phenotype. Additionally, the immune skewing of the SERM may have been initially opposed by the known ability of aromatase inhibitors to potentiate Th1 responses. Indeed, the patient first noticed the appearance of HPV condylomata progressing to the BLT phenotype with the cessation of the aromatase inhibitor therapy under the unopposed influence of the SERM. The resultant cytokine milieu may have contributed to the unusual progression to the BLT phenotype in this otherwise immunocompetent patient.",

        "AbstractText": "Postoperative delirium is a serious sequela of surgery and surgery-related anaesthesia. One recommended method to prevent postoperative delirium is using bi-frontal EEG recording. The single, processed index of depth of anaesthesia allows the anaesthetist to avoid episodes of suppression EEG and excessively deep anaesthesia. The study data presented here were based on multichannel (19 channels) EEG recordings during anaesthesia. This enabled the analysis of various parameters of global electrical brain activity. These parameters were used to compare microstate topographies under anaesthesia with those in healthy volunteers and to analyse changes in microstate quantifiers and EEG global state space descriptors with increasing exposure to anaesthesia. Seventy-three patients from the Surgery Depth of Anaesthesia and Cognitive Outcome study (SRCTN 36437985) received intraoperative multichannel EEG recordings. Altogether, 720\u2005min of artefact-free EEG data, including 210\u2005min (29.2%) of suppression EEG, were analysed. EEG microstate topographies, microstate quantifiers (duration, frequency of occurrence and global field power) and the state space descriptors sigma (overall EEG power), phi (generalized frequency) and omega (number of uncorrelated brain processes) were evaluated as a function of duration of exposure to anaesthesia, suppression EEG and subsequent development of postoperative delirium. The major analyses involved covariate-adjusted linear mixed-effects models. The older (71 \u00b1 7 years), predominantly male (60%) patients received a median exposure of 210 (range: 75-675) min of anaesthesia. During seven postoperative days, 21 patients (29%) developed postoperative delirium. Microstate topographies under anaesthesia resembled topographies from healthy and much younger awake persons. With increasing duration of exposure to anaesthesia, single microstate quantifiers progressed differently in suppression or non-suppression EEG and in patients with or without subsequent postoperative delirium. The most pronounced changes occurred during enduring suppression EEG in patients with subsequent postoperative delirium: duration and frequency of occurrence of microstates C and D progressed in opposite directions, and the state space descriptors showed a pattern of declining uncorrelated brain processes (omega) combined with increasing EEG variance (sigma). With increasing exposure to general anaesthesia, multiple changes in the dynamics of microstates and global EEG parameters occurred. These changes varied partly between suppression and non-suppression EEG and between patients with or without subsequent postoperative delirium. Ongoing suppression EEG in patients with subsequent postoperative delirium was associated with reduced network complexity in combination with increased overall EEG power. Additionally, marked changes in quantifiers in microstate C and in microstate D occurred. These putatively adverse intraoperative trajectories in global electrical brain activity may be seen as preceding and ultimately predicting postoperative delirium.",

        "AbstractText": "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction. It can occur as a paraneoplastic disorder associated with various types of carcinomas, usually small cell lung cancer or as an autoimmune disease. LEMS can be misdiagnosed as myasthenia gravis or as an oncological sequela, causing delays in diagnosis. We present a rare case of a male adult with confirmed LEMS occurring with pancreatic carcinoma. A 66-year-old man presented with a newly diagnosed pancreatic tumor. He had been experiencing weakness and fatigue in his lower extremities since the summer of 2020. Over time, the weakness progressed to include his proximal upper extremity muscles. Dysphonia, dysarthria, decreased appetite and significant weight loss were also observed. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 3 cm locally resectable cystic tumor in the pancreatic head. Blood tests showed elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. A Whipple procedure was performed, which revealed a poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma inside an intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because he had no spontaneous breathing and manifested areflexia signs. A train of four (TOF) monitoring of peripheral nerve stimulation was performed and pyridostigmine therapy was initiated, leading to an improvement in symptoms allowing the extubation and transfer to the peripheral ward. Further diagnostic tests revealed a LEMS and an intravenous therapy with cumulative 100 g immunoglobulin (Ig) G was initiated. Upon discharge, 10 days after starting LEMS treatment, the patient showed subjective and objective improvement in strength. Paraneoplastic syndromes are more common than expected, but rare in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They can appear before abdominal symptoms, facilitating early diagnosis. Successful treatment of cancer may eliminate paraneoplastic symptoms. LEMS may reveal pancreatic cancer. Early recognition of paraneoplastic syndromes is important for pancreatic cancer management. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the diagnostic approach for LEMS in all patients with pancreatic cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is one of acute expiratory diseases, which occurs rarely with a difficult diagnosis. AFOP is related to an idiopathic cause or autoimmune disease, drug use, infection, cancer, or transplantation. Variation of treatment depends on different institutions. To date, no evidence shows that lobar lung transplantation is applied in an urgent situation such as AFOP. A 33-year-old female patient experienced fever, cough, and dyspnea four days prior to admission. She had no underlying health conditions. Initially, she received oxygen therapy and empiric antimicrobial treatment, but later developed pulmonary consolidation. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of AFOP. Despite receiving standardized treatment involving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and mechanical ventilation, the patient's respiratory function remained compromised. Consequently, an urgent lobar lung transplantation was performed. However, the patient encountered several challenges including carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, exophytic granulation tissue, anastomotic stenosis, bronchopleural fistulae, anastomotic infections, septic shock, bacteremia, reperfusion syndrome, primary graft dysfunction, severe renal failure, and critical illness myopathy. Although the patient ultimately recovered and had a favorable survival outcome over 1-year post-discharge through multidisciplinary care, there are several key points to consider. Based on the findings from a systematic review, urgent transplantation may be a potential alternative treatment for AFOP. However, peri-transplantation programs should be enhanced, particularly regarding criteria selection, ECMO management, and the role of enhanced recovery after transplantation. The case demonstrates the feasibility of bilateral lobar lung transplantation in patients with AFOP, especially in an urgent situation.",

The current first-line chemotherapy for advanced MM is a combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed. However, nedaplatin, a second-generation platinum-based antitumor agent, has the similar therapeutic effects as cisplatin but lower toxicity and higher water solubility. To our knowledge, this is the first case of co-existing pericardial and pleural MM treated with nedaplatin and pemetrexed and responding well. A 33-year-old woman, who had worked in a kiln for more than 10 years, suffered from dyspnea and chest tightness for 6 days. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a massive pericardial effusion. She was diagnosed tuberculous pericarditis and received 6 months antituberculosis treatment (rifampicin, isoniazide, pyrazinamide, ethambutol). But it was ineffective and she was re hospitalized again due to massive pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. She was diagnosed with co-existing pericardial and pleural MM finally based on pleural biopsy and cytology of pericardial effusion. She was responding well excitedly to chemotherapy with nedaplatin and pemetrexed with high tolerance. Bone marrow toxicity or recurrent massive pericardial or pleural effusion were not observed during chemotherapy. However, she gave up chemotherapy and has survived for 22 months, from the onset symptoms. In terms of clinical tolerance and less adverse reactions, we suggest that chemotherapy of nedaplatin with pemetrexed may be a more appropriate treatment in advanced MM.

It is classified as MDS/MPN overlap syndrome by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the prognosis is generally poor. Solid tumors are rarely associated with or are secondary to CMML. We here reported a case of a 75-year-old female patient with persistent peripheral blood monocytosis and bone marrow blasts \u226420%. A diagnosis of CMML was made. Unexpectedly, she presented with recurrent melena and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions were ineffective. Capsule endoscopy revealed gastric space-occupying lesions, and pathological biopsy confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma. Because of the patient's history of coronary heart disease and the fact that she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting less than half a year ago, the diagnosis and treatment of this patient required a multidisciplinary team of hematologists, oncologists, anesthesiologists and cardiologists. Physicians should consider the possibility of other malignant solid tumors in patients with CMML. For patients at high risk for gastrointestinal endoscopy, capsule endoscopy may be a safer way to determine if a patient needs further endoscopic biopsy.

CD13, a heavily glycosylated protein, is one example with significant unmet clinical potential in cancer drug discovery. Despite its high expression and activity in cancers, CD13 is also expressed in many normal tissues. Here, we report differential tissue glycosylation of CD13 across tissues and demonstrate for the first time that the nature and pattern of glycosylation of CD13 in preclinical cancer tissues are distinct compared to normal tissues. We identify cancer-specific O-glycosylation of CD13, which selectively blocks its detection in cancer models but not in normal tissues. In addition, the metabolism activity of cancer-expressed CD13 was observed to be critically dependent on its unique glycosylation. Thus, our data demonstrate the existence of discrete cancer-specific CD13 glycoforms and propose cancer-specific CD13 glycoforms as a clinically useful target for effective cancer-targeted therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "The liver coordinates the systemic response to nutrient deprivation and availability by producing glucose from gluconeogenesis during fasting and synthesizing lipids via de novo lipogenesis (DNL) when carbohydrates are abundant. Mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is thought to play important roles in both gluconeogenesis and DNL. We examined the effects of hepatocyte-specific mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) deletion on the fasting-refeeding response. Rates of DNL during refeeding were impaired by hepatocyte MPC deletion, but this did not reduce intrahepatic lipid content. During fasting, glycerol is converted to glucose by two pathways; a direct cytosolic pathway and an indirect mitochondrial pathway requiring the MPC. Hepatocyte MPC deletion reduced the incorporation of 13C-glycerol into TCA cycle metabolites, but not into new glucose. Furthermore, suppression of glycerol and alanine metabolism did not affect glucose concentrations in fasted hepatocyte-specific MPC-deficient mice, suggesting multiple layers of redundancy in glycemic control in mice.",

Transjugular liver biopsy has been introduced as an alternative method to overcome these limitations. Although transjugular liver biopsy is commonly used for diffuse liver diseases, its application to localized tumors has been limited. We report the case of a 66-year-old male initially diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic carcinoma, who later developed liver metastasis, peritoneal dissemination, and ascites. Treatment planning required tumor re-evaluation, but percutaneous liver biopsy was not viable because of the rapid accumulation of ascites and its presence on the liver surface. However, transjugular liver biopsy was a suitable alternative, given the proximity of the tumor to the right hepatic vein. The procedure, performed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance, successfully obtained 4 specimens that were promptly diagnosed as liver metastases originating from pancreatic cancer. This case underscored the effectiveness of transjugular liver biopsy in situations where percutaneous biopsy is challenging because of conditions such as ascites. The combination of ultrasound guidance and rapid specimen assessment by pathology technicians can enhance diagnostic success rates. Transjugular liver biopsy is a valuable diagnostic tool in scenarios where percutaneous access poses significant difficulties.",

However, the adoption of novel treatments into clinical practice has been unknown in Finland. Our aim was to evaluate the use of systemic treatments and treatment outcomes of aRCC patients in Southwest Finland during 2010-2021. Clinical characteristics, treatments for aRCC, healthcare resource utilization, and overall survival (OS) were retrospectively obtained from electronic medical records. Patients were stratified using the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk classification. In total, 1112 RCC patients were identified, 336 (30%) patients presented with aRCC, and 57% of them (n\u2009=\u2009191) had received systemic treatment. Pre-2018, sunitinib (79%) was the most common first-line treatment, and pazopanib (17%), axitinib (17%), and cabozantinib (5%) were frequently used in the second-line. Post-2018, sunitinib (52%), cabozantinib (31%), and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab (10%) were most commonly used in the first-line, and cabozantinib (23%) in the second-line. Median OS for patients with favorable, intermediate, and poor risk were 61.9, 28.6, and 8.1\u2009months, respectively. A total of 73%, 74%, and 35% of the patients with favorable, intermediate, and poor risk had received second-line systemic treatment. In poor-risk patients, the number of hospital inpatient days was twofold higher compared to intermediate and fourfold higher compared to favorable-risk patients. New treatment options were readily adopted into routine clinical practice after becoming reimbursed in Finland. OS and the need for hospitalization depended significantly on the IMDC risk category. Upfront combination treatments are warranted for poor-risk patients as the proportion of patients receiving second-line treatment is low. Clinical trial identifier: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05363072. Observational study on the evolution of systemic treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma in Southwest Finland between 2010 and 2021 The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of novel medical treatments for advanced kidney cancer in routine clinical practice in Southwest Finland from 2010 to 2021 and to study the impact of IMDC risk factors on patients\u2019 survival and healthcare resource utilization. Before 2018, sunitinib (79%) was the most common first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer, and pazopanib (17%), axitinib (17%), and cabozantinib (5%) were frequently used in the second-line. After 2018, sunitinib (52%), cabozantinib (31%), and the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab (10%) were most commonly used in the first-line, and cabozantinib (23%) in the second-line treatment. The IMDC risk category predicted the patient\u2019s prognosis accurately as the median overall survival times for patients with favorable, intermediate, and poor risk were 61.9 months, 28.6 months, and 8.1 months, respectively. 73\u201374% of the patients with favorable and intermediate risk had received second-line medical treatment for advanced disease, whereas only 35% of the patients with poor risk had received second-line treatment after disease progression on the first-line treatment. Among patients with poor risk, the number of hospital inpatient days was twofold higher compared to intermediate and fourfold higher compared to favorable-risk patients.

In this work, we investigate the energy transport between AlClPc and nGO for their combined use in phototherapies. We use density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT to analyze the electronic structure of AlClPc and its interaction with nGO. Based on experimental parameters, we model the system's morphology and implement it in Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations to investigate the energy transfer mechanism between the compounds. Our KMC calculations show that the experimentally observed fluorescence quenching requires modeling both the energy transfer from dyes to nGO and a molecular aggregation model. Our results provide insights into the underlying mechanisms responsible for the fluorescence quenching observed in AlClPc/nGO aggregates, which could impact the efficacy of photodynamic therapy.",

P21-activated kinase (PAK) is a component of the gene expression-based classifier that can predict the prognosis of T-LBL. However, the role of PAK in T-LBL progression and survival remains poorly understood. Herein, we found that the expression of PAK1 was significantly higher in T-LBL cell lines (Jurkat, SUP-T1, and CCRF-CEM) compared to the human T-lymphoid cell line. Moreover, PAK2 mRNA level of 32 relapsed T-LBL patients was significantly higher than that of 37 cases without relapse (P = .012). T-LBL patients with high PAK1 and PAK2 expression had significantly shorter median RFS than those with low PAK1 and PAK2 expression (PAK1, P = .028; PAK2, P = .027; PAK1/2, P = .032). PAK inhibitors, PF3758309 (PF) and FRAX597, could suppress the proliferation of T-LBL cells by blocking the G1/S cell cycle phase transition. Besides, PF could enhance the chemosensitivity to doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, through western blotting and RNA sequencing, we identified that PF could inhibit the phosphorylation of PAK1/2 and downregulate the expression of cyclin D1, NF-\u03baB and cell adhesion signaling pathways in T-LBL cell lines. These findings suggest that PAK might be associated with T-LBL recurrence and further found that PAK inhibitors could suppress proliferation and enhance chemosensitivity of T-LBL cells treated with doxorubicin.

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of micheliolide (MCL), a natural guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone, alone or in combination with ruxolitinib in samples from patients with MPNs, JAK2V617F-mutated MPN cell lines, and a Jak2V617F knock-in mouse model. MCL effectively suppressed colony formation of hematopoietic progenitors in samples from patients with MPNs and inhibited cell growth and survival of MPN cell lines in vitro. Co-treatment with MCL and ruxolitinib resulted in greater inhibitory effects compared with treatment with ruxolitinib alone. Moreover, dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL), an orally available derivative of MCL, significantly increased the efficacy of ruxolitinib in reducing splenomegaly and cytokine production in Jak2V617F knock-in mice without evident effects on normal hematopoiesis. Importantly, MCL could target the Jak2V617F clone and reduce mutant allele burden in vivo. Mechanistically, MCL can form a stable covalent bond with cysteine residues of STAT3/5 to suppress their phosphorylation, thus inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling. Overall, these findings suggest that MCL is a promising drug in combination with ruxolitinib in the setting of suboptimal response to ruxolitinib.",

Disruption of this network in different animal species, including flies, nematodes and mouse, was consistently associated with an extended lifespan. Epidemiological analyses have shown that patients with Laron syndrome (LS), the best-characterized disease under the umbrella of the congenital IGF1 deficiencies, seem to be protected from cancer. While aging and cancer, as a rule, are considered diametrically opposite processes, modern lines of evidence reinforce the notion that aging and cancer might, as a matter of fact, be regarded as divergent manifestations of identical biochemical and cellular underlying processes. While the effect of individual mutations on lifespan and health span is very difficult to assess, genome-wide screenings identified a number of differentially represented aging- and longevity-associated genes in patients with LS. The present review summarizes recent data that emerged from comprehensive analyses of LS patients and portrays a number of previously unrecognized targets for GH-IGF1 action.

At present, there are few reports analyzing risk factors of PSM in laparoscopic RP (LRP), especially for those PCa cases who accepted neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT). Hence, the aim of the current study was to explore risk factors for PSM after LRP in PCa patients with and without NHT. The clinicopathological data of patients who underwent LRP from January 2012 to July 2020 was retrospectively analyzed. Risk factors for PSM after LRP in NHT and non-NHT groups were respectively explored.

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to explore associations of mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP) levels in early pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We also examined interactions of MASPs and deoxycholic acid (DCA)/glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) for the GDM risk and whether the interactive effects if any on the GDM risk were mediated via lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 18:0. A 1:1 case-control study (n = 414) nested in a prospective cohort of pregnant women was conducted in Tianjin, China. Binary conditional logistic regressions were performed to examine associations of MASPs with the GDM risk. Additive interaction measures were used to examine interactions between MASPs and DCA/GUDCA for the GDM risk. Mediation analyses and Sobel tests were used to examine mediation effects of LPC18:0 between the copresence of MASPs and DCA/GUDCA on the GDM risk. High MASP-2 was independently associated with GDM [odds ratio (OR): 2.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.44-4.77], while the effect of high MASP-1 on GDM was attributable to high MASP-2 (P for Sobel test: 0.003). Low DCA markedly increased the OR of high MASP-2 alone from 2.53 (1.10-5.85) up to 10.6 (4.22-26.4), with a significant additive interaction. In addition, high LPC18:0 played a significant mediating role in the links from low DCA to GDM and from the copresence of high MASP-2 and low DCA to GDM (P for Sobel test <0.001) but not in the link from high MASP-2 to GDM. High MASP-1 and MASP-2 in early pregnancy were associated with GDM in Chinese pregnant women. MASP-2 amplifies the risk of low DCA for GDM, which is mediated via LPC18:0.",

Although RNA therapeutics against pro-oncogenic genes are highly effective, tumor-specific delivery remains a barrier to the implementation of this valuable tool. In this study, we report a tryptophan-auxotrophic Salmonella typhimurium strain as an onco-therapeutic delivery system with tumor-targeting ability using 4T1 mice breast-cancer model. The receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cell (RCAS1) is a cancer-specific protein that induces the apoptosis of peripheral lymphocytes and confers tumor immune evasion. We designed a long non-coding antisense-RNA against RCAS1 (asRCAS1) and delivered by Salmonella using a non-antibiotic, auxotrophic-selective, eukaryotic expression plasmid, pJHL204. After in\u00a0vivo tumor-to-tumor passaging, the JOL2888 (\u0394trpA, \u0394trpE, \u0394asd\u00a0+ asRCAS1) strain exhibited high sustainability in tumors, but did not last in healthy organs, thereby demonstrating tumor specificity and safety. RCAS1 inhibition in the tumor was confirmed by western blotting and qPCR. In mice, JOL2888 treatment reduced tumor-associated macrophages, improved the T\u00a0cell population, elicited cell-mediated immunity, and suppressed cancer-promoting genes. Consequently, the JOL2888 treatment significantly decreased the tumor volume by 80%, decreased splenomegaly by 30%, and completely arrested lung metastasis.

The primary objective of this research is to evaluate the survival rates of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer who reside in an affluent suburb and to examine factors that may impact mortality. Information was collected from the Stony Brook Cancer Center registry for all cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2020. The Distressed Community Index, a proxy for SES based on geographic location and data obtained from the U.S. Census, was paired with patient ZIP codes to evaluate the impact of prosperity on survival. Chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and hazard ratios are presented. Among 946 patients with colorectal cancer, more than half resided in a prosperous (Distressed Community Index \u2264 20) ZIP code. Age and sex were similar between Distressed Community Index groups; however, a significant association was found between Black race and Distressed Community Index score >20 (p<0.01). Patients who were married were more likely to live in a prosperous ZIP code (p<0.01), whereas those with Medicaid health insurance were more likely to reside in a nonprosperous community (p<0.01). More than 75% of cases were diagnosed at Stage 2 or higher, and survival rates at 1 year and 5 years were 84.6% and 59.2%, respectively. Stage at diagnosis and overall survival were not associated with Distressed Community Index status. Older age (\u226570 years) (hazard ratio=2.43, 95% CI=1.18, 5.01) and late stage at diagnosis (hazard ratio= 12.24, 95% CI=6.86, 21.81) were found to be associated with increased mortality at 5 years. In this relatively affluent study population from a tertiary care facility registry, improved survival rates among patients with colorectal cancer were not observed compared with national averages. Advanced stage of diagnosis and older age increased mortality in persons with colorectal cancer. Because early detection remains one of the most important tools for improving survival outcomes, efforts to increase screening education and reduce barriers as well as address challenges with screening adherence would likely benefit the population at risk, irrespective of community prosperity.",

However, outcomes vary, as the amount of polymerization is dependent on factors such as disease phenotype/diagnosis, degree of hypoxia, and intracellular dehydration. Most of the literature focuses on patients with sickle cell disease, which produces higher concentrations of sickle hemoglobin and, therefore, is a contraindication to microvascular reconstruction. Fewer reports describe microsurgery in patients with sickle cell trait (SCT) who carry the heterozygous phenotype. Here, we present a case in which a patient with SCT underwent microsurgical breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric perforator free-tissue transfer. The 52-year-old woman had previously experienced a failed alloplastic-based reconstruction after radiation therapy for breast cancer. In our case, clinical and Doppler examinations demonstrated that arterial and venous anastomoses had remained patent; so the patient was discharged on postoperative day 4. Blistering developed on postoperative day 8, and by day 15 there was partial necrosis of the inferior-lateral aspect of the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap. Debridement and closure resolved the issue, and at 5 months postprocedure, the flap remained well-perfused and well-incorporated. This case, presented here with patient consent, reports a successful outcome of microsurgical reconstruction in a patient with SCT. It expands the limited evidence to support the safety and feasibility of autologous surgical interventions for patients with the heterozygous phenotype of sickle cell anemia.",

However, the oncologic safety of surgically diverting lymphatic ducts directly into venules in a node-positive axilla is still a concern of inadvertently inducing metastasis of remaining cancer cells. This study aimed to assess the oncologic safety of ILR. From January 2020 to January 2022, 95 breast cancer patients received ALND, and 45 of them also received ILR. Patients with recurrent cancer, with follow-up less than 12 months, and with missed data were excluded. Variables were compared between ILR and non-ILR groups, and the outcome of interest was the rate of distant recurrence after follow-up for at least 1 year. Thirty-four patients in the ILR group and 32 patients in the non-ILR group fulfilled the inclusion criteria for analysis. No statistically significant difference was noted between groups in terms of age, body mass index, type of breast surgery, pathologic cancer staging, histologic type and grade of breast cancer, molecular subtypes, frequency of axillary lymph node metastasis, or adjuvant therapy. For the patients receiving follow-up for at least 1 year, no statistically significant difference was found in terms of distant recurrence rates between ILR and non-ILR groups (P\u2005=\u20050.44). For breast cancer patients receiving ALND, ILR with lymphovenous anastomosis is oncologically safe, within an average follow-up period of 21 months.",

Meningiomas are usually asymptomatic and discovered inadvertently. They rarely present with immediate clinical symptoms or abrupt hemorrhagic strokes. However, tumor hemorrhage can be fatal in high-grade meningiomas, particularly those with vascularization. We describe a 58-year-old man who was hospitalized after experiencing an unexpectedly acute headache. The right cerebellar hemisphere and vermis cerebellar hemorrhage were detected on computed tomography (CT), and the cerebellar hemorrhage was explained by a diagnosis of hypertension. When additional analysis of the patient's chest CT indicated lung mass lesions, we assumed that the lung cancer had spread to the brain. However, the pathological outcomes of a guided definite pulmonary aspiration biopsy, in conjunction with resection of the cerebellar tumor, suggested a subtentorial meningioma with ruptured hemorrhage and pulmonary meningioma metastasis.

In this study, to investigate the effects of SPOP in HCC and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of its relationship with genes, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were classified through RNA sequencing. The gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional pathway analysis were used to further predict the function of DEGs after the overexpression of SPOP. The biological function of SPOP-regulated alternative splicing events in cells is comprehensively assessed. The Cancer Genome Atlas database and Gene Expression Omnibus dataset were performed to evaluate the correlation between SPOP and HCC progression. Due to SPOP overexpression, 56 DEGs in the HCC related pathway were further identified. The results showed that SPOP overexpression facilitated the cell proliferation and changed the gene expression profiles of human normal hepatocytes. SPOP-regulated alternative splicing events were involved in pathways associated with cellular processes, metabolism, environmental information procession, organismal systems, and so on.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between body mass index (BMI) at breast cancer diagnosis and breast cancer prognosis and whether this association is dependent on menopausal status and tumor subtype in a less developed population in northern China. We collected 1,225 patients with primary invasive cancer in stage I-IIIC for retrospective analysis from October 2010 to December 2020. We used Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses and estimated the relationship between baseline BMI and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Next, we further evaluated whether the effect of BMI on breast cancer prognosis differed by menopausal status and tumor subtype. We found that death rate and prognosis were worse for patients with BMI \u2265 24, more than four positive lymph nodes, and triple negative status. Interestingly, BMI played a different prognostic role depending on tumor subtype and menopausal status. For premenopausal women, patients with BMI \u2265 24 had significantly lower BCSS compared to those with BMI < 24 in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression (HR: 4.305, p = 0.004) and triple negative subtypes (HR: 1.775, p = 0.048).

In this randomized wait-list controlled design people who had been diagnosed with breast or gynecologic cancers were invited to participate with other cancer survivors in a group based setting. Participants were randomized to begin hula immediately or after six months. Attendance was collected and heart-rate measured three times per session. In addition, demographic data, self-report psychosocial data, and biological data (findings will be reported elsewhere) were collected at three time points: baseline, 6\u2009months, and 12\u2009months.

        "AbstractText": "A study was conducted to examine treatment patterns and outcomes among women with a primary ovarian cancer diagnosis in the Midwest region of the United States, an area that has relatively fewer gynecologic oncologists (GOs) and diverse geography with respect to urban and rural areas. In this paper, we examine the methodology of working with central cancer registries (CCRs) to collect additional data items, including those related to GO involvement and detailed treatment. Westat recruited 3 state CCRs from the Midwest to participate in the study. Cases were randomly selected from 2010-2012 ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer diagnoses in participating registry databases that met the selection criteria. CCRs abstracted additional information for selected cases, including study-specific data items regarding surgery and chemotherapy, GO involvement, and recurrence, where applicable. Abstracts with study-specific data items were collected among a total of 1,003 incidence ovarian cancer cases, with 432 additional abstracts for those cases identified as having recurrence. Variables with the highest frequency of unknowns were mostly for patients who had chemotherapy. While data were available for whether the patient received chemotherapy, the specifics about that chemotherapy were not always available, with dosing and unit being unknown in 27% of cases. There were several challenges with initiating and completing this study associated with recruitment, the data collection timeline, and the collection of study-specific data items. This paper outlines the methodologic approach and experience of collecting additional surgical and chemotherapy treatment variables and data on GO involvement in care from medical records. Experiences from this study provide critical lessons that can be applied to future data collection in this area. Ultimately, the accurate collection of these elements enables researchers to identify groups of women who are not receiving the benefit of optimal surgery or GO care and provides critical data on interventions for improved outcomes and survival in ovarian cancer patients.",

We aimed to evaluate existing and new prediction models for ESD duration. Patients and methods Records of all consecutive patients who underwent single, non-hybrid colorectal ESDs before 2020 at three Dutch centers were reviewed. The performance of an Eastern prediction model [GIE 2021;94(1):133-144] was assessed in the Dutch cohort. A prediction model for procedure duration was built using multivariable linear regression. The model's performance was validated using internal validation by bootstrap resampling, internal-external cross-validation and external validation in an independent Swedish ESD cohort. Results A total of 435 colorectal ESDs were analyzed (92% en bloc resections, mean duration 139 minutes, mean tumor size 39 mm). The performance of current unstandardized time scheduling practice was suboptimal (explained variance: R 2 =27%). We successfully validated the Eastern prediction model for colorectal ESD duration <60 minutes (c-statistic 0.70, 95% CI 0.62-0.77), but this model was limited due to dichotomization of the outcome and a relatively low frequency (14%) of ESDs completed <60 minutes in the Dutch centers. The model was more useful with a dichotomization cut-off of 120 minutes (c-statistic: 0.75; 88% and 17% of \"easy\" and \"very difficult\" ESDs completed <120 minutes, respectively). To predict ESD duration as continuous outcome, we developed and validated the six-variable cESD-TIME formula ( https://cesdtimeformula.shinyapps.io/calculator/ ; optimism-corrected R 2 =61%; R 2 =66% after recalibration of the slope). Conclusions We provided two useful tools for predicting colorectal ESD duration at Western centers. Further improvements and validations are encouraged with potential local adaptation to optimize time planning.",

        "AbstractText": "Due to the increase in the number of early-stage breast cancer patients, there is growing interest in minimally invasive local therapies for breast cancer. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy is one of the most promising minimally invasive treatments. The Radiofrequency Ablation Therapy for Early Breast Cancer as Local Therapy (RAFAELO) study, a multicenter collaborative study that aims to validate the efficacy and safety of RFA and to standardize its use for early-stage breast cancer, was conducted under the Advanced Medical Care B system in 2013. This study enrolled the expected number of patients in November 2017; moreover, it is currently in the follow-up period. Some patients with early-stage breast cancer who are eligible for RFA could not receive the RFA treatment, as it is still not covered by insurance. Therefore, the Patients Offer Radiofrequency Ablation Therapy for Early Breast Cancer as Local Therapy (PO-RAFAELO) study under the Patient-proposed Health Services (PPHS) was proposed and approved in March 2019. The PPHS is a system that allows patients to receive prompt access to advanced medical care at a medical facility close to them, starting with their request. This system is considered a part of the specific and special medical coverage. The PO-RAFAELO study is the only study in the surgical field utilizing the PPHS, aiming to help in achieving regulatory approval and insurance coverage of RFA for breast cancer. As of January 2023, 120 patients have undergone RFA using the PPHS and no grade 3 or higher early adverse events have occurred. A certain number of patients with early-stage breast cancer prefer nonsurgical treatment, and it is important to provide information regarding the availability of RFA for early-stage breast cancer under the PPHS.Trial registration: registered with Japan Registry of Clinical Trial on March 06, 2019 (Trial ID: jRCTs032180187).",

        "AbstractText": "Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) mimicking rheumatic diseases are observed in 1.5%-22% of patients receiving cancer therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare autoimmune disease mainly involving auricle, nose, and airway cartilage inflammation. However, knowledge regarding RP as an irAE is scarce. Pembrolizumab, a type of ICI that regulates the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), is used in patients whose cancer cannot be cured with surgery or radiation therapy. We report the first case of pembrolizumab-induced RP with isolated auricular lesions resolved without immunosuppressants. A 49-year-old man with lower lip cancer underwent surgical resection followed by reconstruction. Histopathological investigation confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Since multiple metastases 6 months post-surgery rendered the carcinoma inoperative, pembrolizumab was initiated, improving lymph node involvement. However, 4 months later, the patient developed rapidly progressive swelling and pain in both auricles. While no pathogen was detected, C-reactive protein levels were elevated (11.21 mg/dL). Computed tomography (CT) showed swelling of the bilateral auricles; the biopsy of the right auricle revealed cartilage destruction by infiltration of surrounding granulation tissue. Since these characteristic findings were not observed before pembrolizumab was initiated, we clinically diagnosed the patient with RP induced by pembrolizumab. The swelling of the auricles resolved spontaneously 1 month after pembrolizumab discontinuation. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-positron emission tomography/CT revealed no 18F-FDG uptake in reduced auricular lesions. On re-administration of pembrolizumab to maintain antitumor immunity, both auricles swelled again, and pembrolizumab was switched to paclitaxel, considering the risk of tracheobronchial chondritis. Although no recurrence of auricular chondritis was observed, the patient died from cancer progression 8 months after paclitaxel administration. RP can occur as a rheumatic irAE in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy, and a literature review with retrospective analysis indicates that PD-1 inhibition-induced RP is unusual and atypical.",

        "AbstractText": "Platinum-based combination chemotherapy has been a frontline therapeutic strategy for advanced ovarian cancer. Although patients with ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) respond well to the combination therapy, those with relatively rare histologic subtypes, such as mucinous or clear cell carcinoma of the ovary (OCCC), show resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Even with the recently developed maintenance therapies using molecular targeted inhibitors for ovarian cancers, such as bevacizumab or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, the prognosis of non-HGSC ovarian cancers is unsatisfactory. To overcome the limitations in the treatment of rare ovarian cancers, the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG) has launched a comprehensive project utilizing publicly available genomic databases, including a national clinico-genomic database maintained by the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT). JGOG, a leading group in Japan that conducts clinical trials for the treatment of gynecological malignancies, also established a nationwide network through the long-standing efforts of all participants. Currently, JGOG is engaged in a phase II international clinical trial (CYH33-G201: jRCT2031210216), targeting OCCC with PIK3CA hotspot mutations. The CYH33-G201 trial is sponsor-initiated, and JGOG, in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, is actively recruiting participants. To expand the functions of the nationwide network that JGOG had already established, we held explanatory meetings for this clinical trial in nine different areas throughout Japan to promote the penetration of the CYH33-G201 trial. Through C-CAT database analysis, we estimated that approximately 40% of the patients with OCCC harbored at least 1 of the 17 PIK3CA hotspot mutations designated in the CYH33-G201 trial. JGOG will continue the challenge of establishing novel treatment strategies for rare refractory cancers that will benefit patients suffering from gynecological malignancies, especially those who do not receive satisfactory standard treatment and care.",

Systematic analysis of piRNAs' roles in modulating immune pathways is important for tumor immunotherapy. In this study, in-depth analysis of piRNAs was performed to develop an integrated computational algorithm, the immunology piRNA (ImmPI) pipeline, for uncovering the global expression landscape of piRNAs and identifying their regulatory roles in immune pathways. The immunology piRNAs show a tendency towards overexpression patterns in immune cells, causing perturbations in tumors, being significantly associated with infiltration of immune cells, and having prognostic value. The ImmPI score can contribute to prioritizing tumor-related piRNAs and distinguish two subtypes of SKCM (immune-cold and hot phenotypes), as characterized by different prognoses, immunogenicity and antitumor immunity. Finally, we developed an interactive web resource (ImmPI portal: http://www.hbpding.com/ImmPi) for the biomedical research community, with several useful modules to browse, visualize, and download the results of immunology piRNAs analysis. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive landscape of piRNAs across multiple cancer types and sheds light on their regulatory and functional roles in tumor immunity.

        "AbstractText": "Drug resistance is a prominent impediment to the efficacy of targeted therapies across various cancer types, including glioblastoma (GBM). However, comprehending the intricate intracellular and extracellular mechanisms underlying drug resistance remains elusive. Empirical investigations have elucidated that genetic aberrations, such as gene mutations, along with microenvironmental adaptation, notably angiogenesis, act as pivotal drivers of tumor progression and drug resistance. Nonetheless, mathematical models frequently compartmentalize these factors in isolation. In this study, we present a multiscale agent-based model of GBM, encompassing cellular dynamics, intricate signaling pathways, gene mutations, angiogenesis, and therapeutic interventions. This integrative framework facilitates an exploration of the interplay between genetic mutations and the vascular microenvironment in shaping the dynamic evolution of tumors during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Our simulations unveil that mutations influencing the migration and proliferation of tumor cells expedite the emergence of phenotype heterogeneity, thereby exacerbating tumor invasion under both treated and untreated conditions. Moreover, angiogenesis proximate to the tumor fosters a protumoral milieu, augmenting mutation-induced drug resistance by increasing the survival rate of tumor cells. Collectively, our findings underscore the dual roles of intrinsic genetic mutations and extrinsic microenvironmental adaptations in steering tumor growth and drug resistance. Finally, we substantiate our model predictions concerning the impact of gene mutations and angiogenesis on the responsiveness of targeted therapies by integrating single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, bulk RNA-seq, and clinical data from GBM patients. The multidimensional approach enhances our understanding of the complexities governing drug resistance in glioma and offers insights into potential therapeutic strategies.",

The case group included all patients with suspected prostate cancer, and the control group included individuals without prostate disease who were referred to Ali Asghar and Nour Hospital in Isfahan, Iran, from October 2018 to October 2020. The serum total PSA, free PSA, and PCA3 levels in both groups were measured using the ELISA method with standard kits and compared between the groups. The two groups were matched in terms of age and body mass index (BMI). The results showed that the mean free PSA level in the control group was significantly higher than that in the case group (P<0.05). Conversely, the mean total PSA level in the case group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in the mean PCA3 levels between the case and control groups. In addition, the total PSA variable with a cutoff of \u22643.14 exhibited 93% sensitivity and 82% specificity, demonstrating the highest diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing between prostate cancer and healthy individuals. Similarly, the PCA3 value with a cutoff of \u22643.5 had a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 72%, respectively.

An anonymous, web-based questionnaire was administered via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) with questions focused on inclusivity of minoritized populations with respect to race and ethnicity in prostate cancer clinical trials research. The survey link was distributed across the United States via several professional organizations, prostate cancer groups, and social media.

Overall, 131 respondents completed the survey (70% self-identified as White, 17% as Asian, and 6% as Black). Most respondents practiced in an urban setting (89%). Of those who engaged in outreach with minoritized communities during the trial design process, 69% observed improved enrollment of minoritized populations. However, 18% of respondents noted that outreach alone does not overcome existing structural barriers to participation in clinical trials. Thematic analysis identified four key areas to address for improving equity: structural, health system, trial-/study-specific, and relationship-/engagement-related factors.

The purpose of the study was to assess the demographic and clinical predictors of depression and anxiety among bladder cancer patients and its associations with patient reported supportive care needs and perceived availability of social support. A cross-sectional design was used to investigate the study questions. Bladder cancer patients were recruited from the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN) to complete a questionnaire that included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), bladder cancer patient need survey (BCNAS-32), and the social provisions scale (SPS). The inclusion criteria restricted our sample to include bladder cancer patients who were English speakers, aged 18-85 years, and were able and willing to provide informed consent. Patients who had metastatic disease, cancer recurrence, or other primary cancers at the time of assessment were excluded from the study. Participants included 159 bladder cancer patients. The mean age was 62\u00b19.4 years and 51% were male. Almost two-thirds (62%) of patients reported a diagnosis of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), 25% patient reported clinically significant levels of anxiety, 17% reported clinically significant levels of depression, and 13% and 17% reported abnormal borderline abnormal levels for anxiety and depression, respectively.

We reported annual percent changes (APCs) in age-adjusted rates. Maps plotting county-level incidence rates across the state in five-year time intervals were created. In Pennsylvania, 9,933 TC cases were recorded between 1990-2017. Over two-thirds of patients were < 40 years of age and 95% were White. Approximately 89% presented as local and regional disease. Age-adjusted annual rates of total TC increased from 4.80 to 7.20 patients per 100,000 with an APC of 0.94 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = (0.59, 1.29), P < 0.01) over the study interval.

The patient underwent tumor biopsy, and intraoperative pathological diagnosis (IOD) suspected the diagnosis of medulla oblongata germinoma. He underwent chemoradiotherapy after confirming the diagnosis of germinoma. Intracranial germinoma arising in the medulla oblongata differs from germinomas in other locations due to its higher incidence in individuals in their 20s and a slight female predominance.

To understand differences in the pre-implementation context and inform modifications to implementation strategies, we compared findings between rural and non-rural organizations. We conducted surveys (n\u2009=\u200978) and in-depth interviews (n\u2009=\u200973) with staff at each organization. We assessed perceptions of readiness using the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) scale. In-depth interviews elicited perceived barriers and facilitators to implementing FN in each context. We used descriptive statistics to analyze ORIC results and deductive thematic analysis, employing a codebook guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), to synthesize themes in barriers and facilitators across sites, and by rurality. Results from the ORIC scale indicated strong perceptions of organizational readiness across all sites. Staff from rural areas reported greater confidence in their ability to manage the politics of change (87% rural, 76% non-rural) and in their organization's ability to support staff adjusting to the change (96% rural, 75% non-rural). Staff at both rural and non-rural sites highlighted factors reflective of the Intervention Characteristics (relative advantage) and Implementation Climate (compatibility and tension for change) domains as facilitators. Although few barriers to implementation were reported, differences arose between rural and non-rural sites in these perceived barriers, with non-rural staff more often raising concerns about resistance to change and compatibility with existing work processes and rural staff more often raising concerns about competing time demands and limited resources. Staff across both rural and non-rural settings identified few, but different, barriers to implementing a novel FN intervention that they perceived as important and responsive to patients' needs.

Some 48% reported to have never had a discussion about the risk of CRC in IBD with their HCPs, while 58% were not informed of the role of screening and surveillance in managing CRC risk. IBD patients were poorly aware of CRC risk management and had mixed willingness to comply with a doctor's recommendation. HCP's role in cancer knowledge dissemination was suboptimal and patients desired more information.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Rare urachal mucinous cystic tumor of low malignant potential with peritoneal pseudomyxoma: A case report.",
        "AbstractText": "Mucinous cystic tumors of low malignant potential (MCTLMP) are rare urachal neoplasms. The morphological characteristics and clinical prognosis of MCTLMP is similar to that of mucinous cystic tumors occurring in the ovary and appendix. After complete resection, almost no cases of recurrence or metastasis have been reported. Because MCTLMP is rare, it may be missed in the clinic. MCTLMP can lead to the formation of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), which manifests as the widespread production of mucus in the abdominal cavity and makes the disease complex or difficult to diagnose. At present, only 3 cases of MCTLMP with PMP have been reported in the literature. In the present study a fourth case of urachal MCTLMP in a 74-year-old male that resulted in widespread PMP is presented. Initially, a multilocular cystic lesion was revealed in the urachal duct area at the anterior upper margin of the bladder after a patient, experiencing lower abdominal pain, was imaged. As revealed using light microscopy, the cyst was lined with a mucous columnar epithelium, and part of the epithelium indicated pseudolamellar hyperplasia and papillary structures. The cells indicated mild atypia and low mitotic activity. There was no stromal infiltration of tumor cells, and a large amount of mucous exudate was observed. As preoperative computed tomography examination suggested the presence of a large amount of ascites and there were increased levels of blood tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 125, clinicians considered that the diagnosis maybe a malignant tumor of the urachal gland with peripheral dissemination. However, the diagnosis of MCTLMP with PMP was confirmed by histopathological examination. The mass was completely removed, along with part of the peritoneum and bladder wall as these were within the tumor margin. The appendix appeared normal during surgery. A one off dose of intraperitoneal infusion chemotherapy with 1,000 mg 5-fluorouracil was performed after surgery. No recurrence was observed during the 8-month follow-up period.",

We have previously shown that Annexin A2 is integral in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and in the clinical progression of ER-negative breast cancer, processes which are highly influenced by the surrounding tumor microenvironment and ECM. We investigated how modulations of the ECM may affect the role of Annexin A2 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using western blotting, immunofluorescent confocal microscopy and immuno-precipitation mass spectrometry techniques. We have shown that the presence of collagen-I, the main constituent of the ECM, increases the post-translational phosphorylation of Annexin A2 and subsequently causes the translocation of Annexin A2 to the extracellular surface. In the presence of collagen-I, we identified fibronectin as a novel interactor of Annexin A2, using mass spectrometry analysis. We then demonstrated that reducing Annexin A2 expression decreases the degradation of fibronectin by cancer cells and this effect on fibronectin turnover is increased according to collagen-I abundance. Our results suggest that Annexin A2's role in promoting cancer progression is mediated by collagen-I and Annexin A2 maybe a therapeutic target in the bi-directional cross-talk between cancer cells and ECM remodeling that supports metastatic cancer progression.",

        "AbstractText": "Early prediction of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) response for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients could help oncologists select individualized treatment and avoid toxic effects associated with ineffective therapy in patients unlikely to achieve pathologic complete response (pCR). The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of radiomic features of the peritumoral and tumoral regions from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) acquired at different time points of NAST for early treatment response prediction in TNBC. This study included 163 Stage I-III patients with TNBC undergoing NAST as part of a prospective clinical trial (NCT02276443). Peritumoral and tumoral regions of interest were segmented on DCE images at baseline (BL) and after two (C2) and four (C4) cycles of NAST. Ten first-order (FO) radiomic features and 300 gray-level-co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features were calculated. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to determine the most predictive features. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for performance assessment. Pearson correlation was used to assess intrareader and interreader variability. Seventy-eight patients (48%) had pCR (52 training, 26 testing), and 85 (52%) had non-pCR (57 training, 28 testing). Forty-six radiomic features had AUC at least 0.70, and 13 multivariate models had AUC at least 0.75 for training and testing sets. The Pearson correlation showed significant correlation between readers. In conclusion, Radiomic features from DCE-MRI are useful for differentiating pCR and non-pCR. Similarly, predictive radiomic models based on these features can improve early noninvasive treatment response prediction in TNBC patients undergoing NAST.",

        "AbstractText": "Methotrexate is a commonly used agent in the treatment of many malignancies and rheumatologic/inflammatory diseases. Working by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase and thereby preventing eventual formation of tetrahydrofolate, methotrexate inhibits synthesis of purines and thymidylate, therefore disabling a malignant cell's ability to replicate. While it is able to effectively do this, methotrexate also holds potential for significant toxicity. Therefore, serum methotrexate monitoring is of utmost importance when administering the drug, particularly when high doses are used. Although there are several different measurement systems, the immunoassay is a commonly used monitoring system that may be prone to interference when using agents with similar carbon backbone as methotrexate, including folinic acid (leucovorin) at high doses, as well as in the setting of glucarpidase use and consequent methotrexate breakdown. However, adjusting leucovorin dosing policy and being aware of the potential of the immunoassay to be \"confused\" by similar molecules have allowed for the efficient and effective use of the immunoassay while preventing prolonged hospital stays at our institution.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, contributing to high rates of morbidity and mortality owing to the ability of these tumors to metastasize via the vascular system even in the early stages of progression. While ultrasonography and mammography have enabled the more reliable detection of early-stage breast cancer, these approaches entail high rates of false positive and false negative results Mammograms also expose patients to radiation, raising clinical concerns. As such, there is substantial interest in the development of more accurate and efficacious approaches to diagnosing breast cancer in its early stages when patients are more likely to benefit from curative treatment efforts. Blood-based biomarkers derived from the tumor microenvironment (TME) have frequently been studied as candidate targets that can enable tumor detection when used for patient screening. Through these efforts, many promising biomarkers including tumor antigens, circulating tumor cell clusters, microRNAs, extracellular vesicles, circulating tumor DNA, metabolites, and lipids have emerged as targets that may enable the detection of breast tumors at various stages of progression. This review provides a systematic overview of the TME characteristics of early breast cancer, together with details on current approaches to detecting blood-based biomarkers in affected patients. The limitations, challenges, and prospects associated with different experimental and clinical platforms employed in this context are also discussed at length.",

The aim of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to more effectively identify T1 CRCs at risk for LNM and reduce the rate of unnecessary additional surgery. We retrospectively analyzed 651 patients with T1 CRCs. The patient cohort was randomly divided into a training set (546 patients) and a test set (105 patients) (ratio 5:1), and a classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm was trained on the training set to develop a predictive AI model for LNM. The model used 12 clinicopathological factors to predict positivity or negativity for LNM. To compare the performance of the AI model with the conventional guidelines, the test set was evaluated according to the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Finally, we tested the performance of the AI model using the test set and compared it with the JSCCR and NCCN guidelines. The AI model had better predictive performance (AUC=0.960) than the JSCCR (AUC=0.588) and NCCN guidelines (AUC=0.850). The specificity (85.8% vs. 17.5%, p<0.001), balanced accuracy (92.9% vs. 58.7%, p=0.001), and the positive predictive value (36.3% vs. 9.0%, p=0.001) of the AI model were significantly better than those of the JSCCR guidelines and reduced the percentage of the high-risk group for LNM from 83.8% (JSCCR) to 20.9%. The specificity of the AI model was higher than that of the NCCN guidelines (85.8% vs. 82.4%, p=0.557), but there was no significant difference between the two. The sensitivity of the NCCN guidelines was lower than that of our AI model (87.5% vs. 100%, p=0.301), and according to the NCCN guidelines, 1.2% of the 105 test set patients had missed diagnoses. The AI model has better performance than conventional guidelines for predicting LNM in T1 CRCs and therefore could significantly reduce unnecessary additional surgery.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The central role of gastrin in gastric cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "The prevalence of gastric cancer has markedly declined, but due to the high mortality rates associated with gastric cancer, it is still a serious disease. The preferred classification of gastric cancer is according to Lauren into either the intestinal type, which has a glandular growth pattern, or the diffuse type, which does not have glandular structures. Both types have been classified as adenocarcinomas, with the latter type based on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positivity presumed to reflect mucin. However, the presence of mucin in the diffuse type, in contrast to neuroendocrine/enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell markers, has not been confirmed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The ECL cells are probably prone to becoming cancerous because they do not express E-cadherin. Gastric cancer is unique in that a bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, is thought to be its main cause. H. pylori predisposes infected individuals to cancer only after having caused oxyntic atrophy leading to gastric hypoacidity and hypergastrinemia. No single H. pylori factor has been convincingly proved to be carcinogenic. It is probable that gastrin is the pathogenetic factor for gastric cancer due to H. pylori, autoimmune gastritis, and long-term prolonged inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Hypergastrinemia induces ECL cell hyperplasia, which develops into neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and then into neuroendocrine carcinomas in rodents, a sequence that has also been described in humans. During carcinogenesis, the tumor cells lose specific traits, requiring that sensitive methods be used to recognize their origin. Gastric cancer occurrence may hopefully be prevented by H. pylori eradication at a young age, and by the reduced use of inhibitors of acid secretion and use of a gastrin antagonist in those with previous long-term H. pylori infection and those with autoimmune gastritis.",

While a range of new approaches have broadened therapeutic options for patients in later lines, data regarding treatment patterns and outcomes of Chinese patients with relapsed/refractory(R/R) FL was scarcely reported. This retrospective single-center study included patients diagnosed with FL grades 1-3a at our institution between January 2002 and December 2019. Endpoints of interest were analyzed according to lines and types of interventions. The endpoints mainly included overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The study enrolled 566 biopsy-proven patients. Among them, 544 patients initiated the first line of treatment, followed by 240 initiating the second line, 146 initiating the third line, 88 initiating the fourth line, 47 initiating the fifth line, and 28 initiating the sixth line. In terms of treatment patterns, anti-CD20 chemotherapy was a major modality in the first and second lines. However, for patients in the third line and subsequent lines, treatment approaches were diverse, and participation in clinical trials for new medications was common, which correlated with a survival benefit. The study also revealed that clinical indicators (such as ORR, PFS, and OS) gradually decreased with each subsequent line of treatment. The ORR at the first line was 86.6%, but decreased to 48.6% at the third line and 40.4% at the sixth line, respectively. Similarly, median OS and PFS decreased to 88.8 and 7.1 months at the third line and further reduced to 21.7 and 2.8 months at the sixth line, respectively. A total of 133 patients developed progression within 24 months from the initiation of first line anti-CD20 chemotherapy (POD24), and these patients exhibited poorer response rates and outcomes in subsequent lines of therapycompared to the non-POD24 group. This study revealed the clinical routine practices and prognosis of R/R FL patients within the Chinese population.

A retrospective study was conducted on 266 patients with preoperative rectal MRI examinations, who underwent complete surgical resection and confirmed pathological diagnosis of rectal cancer. Among them, patients from Qingdao West Coast Hospital were assigned as the training group (n=172), while patients from other hospitals were assigned as the external validation group (n=94). Regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated, and image features were extracted and dimensionally reduced using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Eight machine algorithms were used to construct the models, and the diagnostic performance of the models was evaluated and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC), as well as clinical utility assessment using decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 1197 features were extracted, and after feature selection and dimension reduction, 11 image features related to TB grading were obtained.

The significant heterogeneity in clinical presentation, histological features, multi-omics findings, and drug sensitivity among different lung cancer patients necessitate the development of personalized treatment strategies. The current precision medicine for lung cancer, primarily based on pathological and genomic multi-omics testing, fails to meet the needs of patients with clinically refractory lung cancer. Lung cancer organoids (LCOs) are derived from tumor cells within tumor tissues and are generated through three-dimensional tissue culture, enabling them to faithfully recapitulate in vivo tumor characteristics and heterogeneity. The establishment of a series of LCOs biobanks offers promising platforms for efficient screening and identification of novel targets for anti-tumor drug discovery. Moreover, LCOs provide supplementary decision-making factors to enhance the current precision medicine for lung cancer, thereby addressing the limitations associated with pathology-guided approaches in managing refractory lung cancer. This article presents a comprehensive review on the construction methods and potential applications of LCOs in both preclinical and clinical research.

Here, we describe a case of prolonged disease stabilization by imetelstat treatment of a high-risk PMF patient enrolled into the clinical study MYF2001. We confirmed continuous shortening of telomere length (TL) by imetelstat treatment but observed emergence and expansion of a KRAST58I mutated clone during the patient's clinical course. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the imetelstat treatment response, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from this patient. TL of iPSC-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which was increased after reprogramming, was reduced upon imetelstat treatment for 14 days. However, while imetelstat reduced clonogenic growth of the patient's primary CD34+ cells, clonogenic growth of iPSC-derived CD34+ cells was not affected, suggesting that TL was not critically short in these cells. Also, the propensity of iPSC differentiation toward megakaryocytes and granulocytes was not altered. Using human TF-1MPL and murine 32DMPL cell lines stably expressing JAK2V617F or CALRdel52, imetelstat-induced reduction of viability was significantly more pronounced in CALRdel52 than in JAK2V617F cells. This was associated with an immediate downregulation of JAK2 phosphorylation and downstream signaling as well as a reduction of hTERT and STAT3 mRNA expression. Hence, our data demonstrate that imetelstat reduces TL and targets JAK/STAT signaling, particularly in CALR-mutated cells. Although the exact patient subpopulation who will benefit most from imetelstat needs to be defined, our data propose that CALR-mutated clones are highly vulnerable.",

Nonetheless, its role in pancreatic cancer (PC) therapy remains debated. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the role of Interferon-\u03b3 related genes (IFN-\u03b3Gs) in the progression of PC development. Transcriptomic data from 930 PC were sourced from TCGA, GEO, ICGC, and ArrayExpress, and 93 IFN-\u03b3Gs were obtained from the MSigDB. We researched the characteristics of IFN-\u03b3Gs in pan-cancer. Subsequently, the cohort of 930 PC was stratified into two distinct subgroups using the NMF algorithm. We then examined disparities in the activation of cancer-associated pathways within these subpopulations through GSVA analysis. We scrutinized immune infiltration in both subsets and probed classical molecular target drug sensitivity variations. Finally, we devised and validated a novel IFN-\u03b3 related prediction model using LASSO and Cox regression analyses. Furthermore, we conducted RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry assays to validate the expression of seven target genes included in the prediction model. We demonstrated the CNV, SNV, methylation, expression levels, and prognostic characteristics of IFN-\u03b3Gs in pan-cancers. Notably, Cluster 2 demonstrated superior prognostic outcomes and heightened immune cell infiltration compared to Clusters 1. We also assessed the IC50 values of classical molecular targeted drugs to establish links between IFN-\u03b3Gs expression levels and drug responsiveness. Additionally, by applying our prediction model, we segregated PC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, identifying potential benefits of cisplatin, docetaxel, pazopanib, midostaurin, epothilone.B, thapsigargin, bryostatin.1, and AICAR for high-risk PC patients, and metformin, roscovitine, salubrinal, and cyclopamine for those in the low-risk group. The expression levels of these model genes were further verified through HPA website data and qRT-PCR assays in PC cell lines and tissues. This study unveils IFN-\u03b3Gs related molecular subsets in pancreatic cancer for the first time, shedding light on the pivotal role of IFN-\u03b3Gs in the progression of PC. Furthermore, we establish an IFN-\u03b3Gs related prognostic model for predicting the survival of PC, offering a theoretical foundation for exploring the precise mechanisms of IFN-\u03b3Gs in PC.",

Studies in some types of hormone-dependent cancer have revealed a role of sex hormones in anti-tumor response, tumor microenvironment and immune evasion. Estrogens mainly promote immune tolerance regulating T-cell function and modifying tumor microenvironment, while androgens attenuate anti-tumor immune responses.

There is an urgent need to conduct a dataset analysis for such patients, which is crucial to improving the survival rate and quality of life of these patients. Patients with colon cancer associated with retroperitoneal abscess were extracted from our hospital and the PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases. Clinical information, including the patients' basic characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, imaging examinations, treatment methods and prognosis was analyzed. Sixty-one patients were analyzed, with an average age of 65 years. The proportions of right and left colon cancers were 63.9% and 36.1%, respectively. A total of 98.0% of the patients had adenocarcinoma. Many patients have insidious symptoms such as fever and weight loss. At the first medical visit, pain was the most common symptom (71%), with pain in the thigh (21.8%), abdomen (21.8%), and waist and back (14.5%) ranking among the top three. The misdiagnosis rate of the patients referred to our department was 75%, while the overall misdiagnosis rate in the literature was 43.9%. Laboratory tests show that these patients often have elevated white blood cells and anemia. CT examination showed that 87.2% of patients had an iliopsoas muscle abscess, and tumors were not simultaneously detected in 37.2%. A total of 33.9% of patients had local abscesses of the iliopsoas muscle, 26.4% had drainage into the subcutaneous tissue of the waist and upper buttocks, and 22.6% had drainage around the adductor muscle group of the thigh. These patients have a variety of treatments, and many patients have undergone multiple and unnecessary treatments. Thirteen patients died after surgery, and 6 died in the hospital, of whom four were patients undergoing direct surgery, and the other 7 died after discharge due to cachexia. Colorectal cancer with retroperitoneal abscess is a relatively rare and easily misdiagnosed subtype of colon cancer. It is more likely to occur in right-sided colon adenocarcinoma.

        "ArticleTitle": "Case Report: Bilateral targeted intraoperative radiotherapy: a safe and effective alternative for synchronous bilateral breast cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "The incidence of bilateral breast cancer (BBC) ranges from 1.4% to 11.8%. BBC irradiation is a challenge in current clinical practice due to the large target volume that must be irradiated while minimizing the dose to critical organs. Supine or prone breast techniques can be used, with the latter providing better organ sparing; both, however, result in lengthy treatment times. The use of Intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT) in breast cancer patients who choose breast conservation has been highlighted in previous studies, but there is a scarcity of literature analyzing the utility and applicability of IORT in BBC. This case series aims to highlight the applicability of administering bilateral IORT in patients with BBC. Five patients with bilateral early-stage breast cancer (or DCIS) were treated with breast-conserving surgery followed by bilateral IORT. Of the 10 breast cancers, 8 were diagnosed as either DCIS or IDC, while the other 2 were diagnosed as invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive carcinoma, respectively. During surgery, all patients received bilateral IORT. Furthermore, 1 patient received external beam radiation therapy after her final pathology revealed grade 3 DCIS. The IORT procedure was well tolerated by all five patients, and all patients received aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy. Additionally, none of these patients showed evidence of disease after a 36-month median follow-up. Our findings demonstrate the successful use of IORT for BCS in patients with BBC. Furthermore, none of the patients in our study experienced any complications, suggesting the feasibility of the use of IORT in BBC. Considering the benefits of improved patient compliance and a reduced number of multiple visits, IORT may serve as an excellent patient-centered alternative for BBC. Future studies are recommended to reinforce the applicability of IORT in patients with BBC.",

        "AbstractText": "Background and study aims Pancreatic cysts are common incidental findings, with an estimated prevalence of 13% to 15% in imaging done for other reasons. Diagnosis often relies on collection of cyst fluid, but tissue sampling using micro-forceps may allow for a more reliable diagnosis and higher yield of DNA for next-generation sequencing (NGS). The primary aim was to assess the performance of NGS in identifying mucinous cyst. The secondary aims were to assess DNA yield between the cyst fluid and cyst wall tissue, complication rate and performance of conventional investigations. Patients and methods Twenty-four patients referred for endoscopic ultrasound were recruited. Biopsies were taken using micro-forceps and the AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot panel was used for NGS, a polymerase chain reaction assay targeting several hotspots within 50 genes, including GNAS , KRAS and VHL . Results The concentration of DNA extracted from 24 cyst wall samples was significantly higher than in the nine of 24 available matched cyst fluid samples. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of NGS for diagnosing mucinous cyst were 93%, 50% and 84%; for standard of care, they were -66.6%, 50% and 63.1%; and for standard of care with NGS, they were 100%, 50%, and 89.4% respectively. Cyst wall biopsy was able to diagnose 19 of 24 cysts (4 high risk, 7 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, 4 cysts of mucinous origin, and 4 benign). Conclusions NGS data correlate well with histology and may aid in diagnosis and risk stratification of pancreatic cysts. Cyst wall biopsy performs well in diagnosing cysts but was inadequate in five of 24 patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Carboplatin (CPT) and paclitaxel (PCT) are the optimal non-surgical treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Although their growth-restricting influence on EOC cells is well known, their impact on normal peritoneal cells, including mesothelium (PMCs) and fibroblasts (PFBs), is poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether, and if so, by what mechanism, CPT and PCT induce senescence of omental PMCs and PFBs. In addition, we tested whether PMC and PFB exposure to the drugs promotes the development of a pro-cancerogenic phenotype. The results showed that CPT and PCT induce G2/M growth arrest-associated senescence of normal peritoneal cells and that the strongest induction occurs when the drugs act together. PMCs senesce telomere-independently with an elevated p16 level and via activation of AKT and STAT3. In PFBs, telomeres shorten along with an induction of p21 and p53, and their senescence proceeds via the activation of ERK1/2. Oxidative stress in CPT\u2009+\u2009PCT-treated PMCs and PFBs is extensive and contributes causatively to their premature senescence. Both PMCs and PFBs exposed to CPT\u2009+\u2009PCT fuel the proliferation, migration, and invasion of established (A2780, OVCAR-3, SKOV-3) and primary EOCs, and this activity is linked with an overproduction of multiple cytokines altering the cancer cell transcriptome and controlled by p38 MAPK, NF-\u03baB, STAT3, Notch1, and JAK1. Collectively, our findings indicate that CPT and PCT lead to iatrogenic senescence of normal peritoneal cells, which paradoxically and opposing therapeutic needs alters their phenotype towards pro-cancerogenic. It cannot be excluded that these adverse outcomes of chemotherapy may contribute to EOC relapse in the case of incomplete tumor eradication and residual disease initiation. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer immunotherapy has attracted considerable attention due to its advantages of persistence, targeting, and ability to kill tumor cells. However, the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy in practical applications is limited by tumor heterogeneity and complex tumor immunosuppressive microenvironments in which abundant of M2 macrophages and immune checkpoints (ICs) are present. Herein, two type-I aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active photosensitizers with various reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating efficiencies are designed and synthesized. Engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) that express ICs Siglec-10 are first obtained from 4T1 tumor cells. The engineered EVs are then fused with the AIE photosensitizer-loaded lipidic nanosystem to form SEx@Fc-NPs. The ROS generated by the inner type-I AIE photosensitizer of the SEx@Fc-NPs through photodynamic therapy (PDT) can convert M2 macrophages into M1 macrophages to improve tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The outer EV-antigens that carry 4T1 tumor-associated antigens directly stimulate dendritic cells maturation to activate different types of tumor-specific T cells in overcoming tumor heterogeneity. In addition, blocking Siglec-10 reversed macrophage exhaustion for enhanced antitumor ability. This study presents that a combination of PDT, immune checkpoints, and EV-antigens can greatly improve the efficiency of tumor immunotherapy and is expected to serve as an emerging strategy to improve tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and overcome immune escape.",

However, how chronological aging alters VSMCs' ability to sense and adapt to mechanical perturbations remains unexplored. Here, we show defective VSMC mechanosensation in aging measured with ultrasound tweezers-based micromechanical system, force instantaneous frequency spectrum, and transcriptome analyses. The study reveals that aged VSMCs adapt to a relatively inert mechanobiological state with altered actin cytoskeletal integrity, resulting in an impairment in their mechanosensitivity and dynamic mechanoresponse to mechanical perturbations. The aging-associated decline in mechanosensation behaviors is mediated by hyperactivity of Piezo1-dependent calcium signaling. Inhibition of Piezo1 alleviates vascular aging and partially restores the loss in dynamic contractile properties in aged cells. Altogether, our study reveals the signaling pathway underlying aging-associated aberrant mechanosensation in VSMC and identifies Piezo1 as a potential therapeutic mechanobiological target to alleviate vascular aging.",

Herein, we develop a hyaluronic acid (HA)-Ce6-Olaparib (OLA) micelle (HCCO), which combines the CSC targeting of HA, the PDT effect of Ce6, and the DNA damage repair inhibition of OLA. More importantly, HCCO induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) effects, promotes dendritic cells maturation, and alleviates myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) infiltration to reverse CSC resistance. As a result, HCCO not only significantly inhibits the growth of 4T1 breast cancer cells and CSCs in vitro, but also effectively inhibits tumor recurrence and metastasis in vivo.

Therefore, the treatment of TNBC urgently requires agents with effective diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. In this study, we obtained programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody conjugated gold nanoshelled poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocapsules (NCs) encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX) (DOX@PLGA@Au-PD-L1 NCs). PLGA NCs encapsulating DOX were prepared by a modified single-emulsion oil-in-water (O/W) solvent evaporation method, and gold nanoshells were formed on the surface by gold seed growth method, which were coupled with PD-L1 antibodies by carbodiimide method. The fabricated DOX@PLGA@Au-PD-L1 NCs exhibited promising contrast enhancement in vitro ultrasound imaging. Furthermore, DOX encapsulated in NCs displayed good pH-responsive and photo-triggered drug release properties. After irradiating 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL NCs solution with a laser for 10\u2009min, the solution temperature increased by nearly 23\u00b0C, indicating that the NCs had good photothermal conversion ability. The targeting experiments confirmed that the NCs had specific target binding ability to TNBC cells overexpressing PD-L1 molecules. Cell experiments exhibited that the agent significantly reduced the survival rate of TNBC cells through photochemotherapy combination therapy. As a multifunctional diagnostic agent, DOX@PLGA@Au-PD-L1 NCs could be used for ultrasound targeted contrast imaging and photochemotherapy combination therapy of TNBC cells, providing a promising idea for early diagnosis and treatment of TNBC.",

        "AbstractText": "Premature ovarian failure may be a consequence of radiotherapy administered for the treatment of various female oncologic diseases. Before radiotherapy, fertility may be preserved through ovarian transposition (OT), which consists of moving the ovaries away from the radiation field. To ascertain all types of surgical techniques employed for OT, outline the endocrine and reproductive outcomes of each one, and discover if one works better than the others. The authors performed a systematic search of the English literature looking for all studies related to OT before radiotherapy published up to June 2023. Nine studies were included. The eligible studies were assessed based on the presence of a description of the surgical technique employed for OT before pelvic radiotherapy and a report of the endocrine and reproductive outcomes. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals were used to compare endocrine and reproductive outcomes The \u03c72 test was employed for the statistical analysis and a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 323 female patients aged between 7 and 51\u2009years-198 (61.3%) with non-gynecologic cancer and 125 (38.7%) with gynecologic cancer-underwent OT, either bilateral (221, 68.4%) or unilateral (102, 31.6%), before radiotherapy. Essentially, two types of OT were employed: lateral and medial. A total of 71 (22%) patients underwent medial OT and 252 (78%) patients (127 with non-gynecologic tumors and 125 with gynecologic tumors) had a lateral OT. The latter was used in a similar percentage of cases for gynecologic (50.4%) and non-gynecologic (49.6%) tumors, whereas the medial approach was performed only for non-gynecologic cancers (Hodgkin's lymphoma). The difference between medial OT and lateral OT was not significant regarding the preservation of endocrine function (OR 0.65, P\u2009=\u20090.120). However, midline OT worked better in terms of reproductive outcomes. In fact, the percentage of patients with pregnancy (49.2%) and live births (45%) associated with medial OT was significantly higher than that associated with lateral OT, 6.5% and 13.4%, respectively, and the difference between such data was statistically significant (OR 7.04, P\u2009=\u20090.001 and OR 5.29, P\u2009=\u20090.003, respectively). Ovarian transposition is an important method to preserve fertility before radiotherapy, considering the worldwide ongoing use of this treatment for various cancers arising in young women. The surgical method depends on the type of disease, but OT-especially medial OT when feasible-is effective in terms of ovarian function preservation and reproductive outcomes.",

Current treatment consists of intensive chemotherapy, leading to 80% overall survival but are associated with severe toxic side effects. Furthermore, 10-20% of patients still die from relapsed or refractory disease providing a strong rationale for more specific, targeted therapeutic strategies with less toxicities. Here, we report a novel MYH9::PDGFRB fusion in a T-LBL patient and demonstrate that this fusion product is constitutively active and sufficient to drive oncogenic transformation in vitro and in vivo. Expanding our analysis more broadly across T-ALL, we found a T-ALL cell line and multiple patient derived xenograft models with PDGFRB hyperactivation in the absence of a fusion, with high PDGFRB expression in TLX3 and HOXA T-ALL molecular subtypes. To target this PDGFRB hyperactivation, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of a selective PDGFRB inhibitor, CP-673451, both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated sensitivity if the receptor is hyperactivated. Altogether, our work reveals that hyperactivation of PDGFRB is an oncogenic driver in T-ALL/T-LBL and that screening T-ALL/TLBL patients for phosphorylated PDGFRB levels can serve as a biomarker for PDGFRB inhibition as a novel targeted therapeutic strategy in their treatment regimen.",

Residual endotoxins in the final sample may hamper the properties of the product or induce severe adverse effects. Developing an effective downstream purification protocol that ensures a lack of minimal endotoxin content in the final product can be a challenging task. In our previous studies, we developed nanospheres produced from bioengineered silks. Despite their good overall biocompatibility, in vivo characterization of spheres showed mild activation of the immune system (mainly in terms of anti-silk antibody production). Herein, we examined, if the endotoxins delivered with the silk spheres might have contributed to activating the adaptive immune response. We investigated various commercially available methods for endotoxin removal that can be applied as an extra step in downstream endotoxin removal from MS1-type silk proteins. We selected a method that allowed for a 10-fold reduction of endotoxin content in soluble silk and 2-fold in the final product (silk spheres). The reduced level of endotoxins improved the biocompatibility of the silk spheres as these particles induced negligible titers of anti-silk antibodies in an in vivo immune study. Since endotoxins can enhance life-threatening immune responses, it is crucial to optimize the method of their removal before clinical use not only of silk-based products but also of other biomolecules produced biotechnologically.",

Additional scRNA-seq data of four healthy donors were incorporated for further bioinformatic analysis.

Recently, autoantibodies (aAbs) against the CXC-motif-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), a G protein-coupled receptor with a key role in atherosclerosis, have been identified. The role of anti-CXCR3 aAbs for CV risk and disease is unclear. Anti-CXCR3 aAbs were quantified by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 5000 participants (availability: 97.1%) of the population-based Gutenberg Health Study with extensive clinical phenotyping. Regression analyses were carried out to identify determinants of anti-CXCR3 aAbs and relevance for clinical outcome (i.e. all-cause mortality, cardiac death, heart failure, and major adverse cardiac events comprising incident coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death). Last, immunization with CXCR3 and passive transfer of aAbs were performed in ApoE(-/-) mice for preclinical validation. The analysis sample included 4195 individuals (48% female, mean age 55.5 \u00b1 11 years) after exclusion of individuals with autoimmune disease, immunomodulatory medication, acute infection, and history of cancer. Independent of age, sex, renal function, and traditional CV risk factors, increasing concentrations of anti-CXCR3 aAbs translated into higher intima-media thickness, left ventricular mass, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Adjusted for age and sex, anti-CXCR3 aAbs above the 75th percentile predicted all-cause death [hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval) 1.25 (1.02, 1.52), P = .029], driven by excess cardiac mortality [HR 2.51 (1.21, 5.22), P = .014]. A trend towards a higher risk for major adverse cardiac events [HR 1.42 (1.0, 2.0), P = .05] along with increased risk of incident heart failure [HR per standard deviation increase of anti-CXCR3 aAbs: 1.26 (1.02, 1.56), P = .03] may contribute to this observation. Targeted proteomics revealed a molecular signature of anti-CXCR3 aAbs reflecting immune cell activation and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions associated with an ongoing T helper cell 1 response. Finally, ApoE(-/-) mice immunized against CXCR3 displayed increased anti-CXCR3 aAbs and exhibited a higher burden of atherosclerosis compared to non-immunized controls, correlating with concentrations of anti-CXCR3 aAbs in the passive transfer model. In individuals free of autoimmune disease, anti-CXCR3 aAbs were abundant, related to CV end-organ damage, and predicted all-cause death as well as cardiac morbidity and mortality in conjunction with the acceleration of experimental atherosclerosis.",

Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), which has gained prominence over time as an essential part of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, is one such example. The ceRNA biology hypothesis states that coding RNA and non-coding RNA co-regulate each other using microRNA (miRNA) response elements. The ceRNA components include long non-coding RNAs, pseudogene and circular RNAs that exert their effect by interacting with miRNA and regulate the expression level of its target genes. Emerging evidence has revealed that the dysregulation of the ceRNA network is attributed to the pathogenesis of various cancers, including the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This is the most prevalent cancer developed from the mucosal epithelium in the lip, oral cavity, larynx and pharynx. Although many efforts have been made to comprehend the cause and subsequent treatment of HNSCC, the morbidity and mortality rate remains high. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the holistic progression of HNSCC, mediated by ceRNA, that can have immense relevance in identifying novel biomarkers with a defined therapeutic intervention. In this review, we have made an effort to highlight the ceRNA biology hypothesis with a focus on its involvement in the progression of HNSCC.

While evidence supporting population screening is nascent, a rush to market the new tests is prompting cancer early detection researchers to revisit the standard blueprint established by the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) for evaluating novel screening biomarkers. In this commentary, we review the EDRN's Phases of Biomarker Development (PBD) for rigorous evaluation of novel early detection biomarkers and discuss both hazards and opportunities involved in expedited evaluation. According to the PBD, for a biomarker-based test to be considered for population screening: (1) test sensitivity in a prospective screening setting must be adequate, (2) the shift to early curable stages must be meaningful, and (3) any stage shift must translate into clinically significant mortality benefit. In the past, determining mortality benefit has required lengthy randomized screening trials, but interest is growing in expedited trial designs with shorter-term endpoints. Whether and how best to use such endpoints in a manner that retains the rigor of the PBD remains to be determined.

Following Cd treatment, Bcrp-null offspring were shorter and accumulated more Cd in their placentas on GD 17 compared to WT mice. Because Cd can adversely impact placentation and transplacental nutrient delivery in mice, multiple pathways were assessed using morphometrics and immunohistochemistry including placenta zonation, vasculature development, and nutrient transporter expression. Most notably, the placentas of Bcrp-null mice had reduced immunostaining of the cell adhesion marker, \u03b2-catenin, and the trophoblast marker, cytokeratin, as well as decreased expression of divalent metal nutrient transporters (Dmt1, Zip14, and ZnT1) following Cd treatment.

        "AbstractText": "We sought to determine whether six commonly used immunosuppressive regimens were associated with lower antibody responses after seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with IBD. We conducted a prospective study including 213 IBD patients and 53 healthy controls; 165 who had received seasonal influenza vaccine and 101 who had not. IBD medications included infliximab, thiopurines, infliximab and thiopurine combination therapy, ustekinumab, vedolizumab or tofacitinib. The primary outcome was antibody responses against influenza/A H3N2 and A/H1N1, compared to controls, adjusting for age, prior vaccination and interval between vaccination and sampling. Lower antibody responses against influenza A/H3N2 were observed in patients on infliximab (Geometric Mean Ratio 0.35 [95% CI 0.20-0.60], p=0.0002), combination of infliximab and thiopurine therapy (0.46 [0.27-0.79], p=0.0050) and tofacitinib (0.28 [0.14-0.57], p=0.0005) compared to controls. Lower antibody responses against A/H1N1 were observed in patients on infliximab (0.29 [0.15-0.56], p=0.0003), combination of infliximab and thiopurine therapy (0.34 [0.17-0.66], p=0.0016), thiopurine monotherapy (0.46 [0.24-0.87], p=0.017) and tofacitinib (0.23 [0.10-0.56], p=0.0013). Ustekinumab and vedolizumab were not associated with reduced antibody responses against A/H3N2 or A/H1N1. Vaccination in the previous year was associated with higher antibody responses to A/H3N2. Vaccine-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentration weakly correlated with antibodies against H3N2 (r=0.27; p=0.0004) and H1N1 (r=0.33; p<0.0001). Vaccination in both the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 seasons was associated with significantly higher antibody responses to influenza/A than no vaccination or vaccination in 2021-2022 alone. Infliximab and tofacitinib are associated with lower binding antibody responses to Influenza/A, similar to COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses.",

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to construct an effective nomogram based on the clinical and laboratory characteristics to predict the prognosis of stage I lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. A retrospective study was performed on 913 eligible patients with EGFR mutation after surgery at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. The peripheral blood indicators were included in the nomogram. Calibration plots, concordance index (C-index), decision curve analysis (DCA), and the X-tile software were used in this study. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were independent risk factors for RFS. The calibration curves for RFS probabilities showed a good agreement between the nomogram prediction and actual observation. Furthermore, the nomogram including NLR and PLR had a higher C-index (0.732, 95% CI, 0.706-0.758) than that without NLR or PLR (0.713, 95% CI, 0.686-0.740), and DCA plots showed that the nomogram with NLR and PLR had better clinical practicability. Additionally, the patients were divided into two groups according to cut-off values of risk points, and significant differences in RFS and OS were observed between the high-risk and low-risk groups (P\u2009<\u20090.001). High pretreatment levels of NLR and PLR were strongly associated with a worse prognosis in stage I EGFR-mutated LUADs. Besides, the proposed nomogram with NLR and PLR presented a better prediction ability for the survival of those patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) comprise a diverse group of indolent lymphoproliferative disorders; however, some patients develop histologic transformation (HT) with rapid progression to aggressive lymphoma. Forty-three MZLs with HT (HT-MZLs), 535 MZLs, and 174 de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) without rearrangements of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 were collected. Among these, 22 HT-MZLs, 39 MZLs, and 174 DLBCLs were subjected to 148-gene targeted exome sequencing. The clinicopathologic features of patients who had HT-MZL and their genetic alterations were compared with those of patients who had MZLs and DLBCLs. All 43 HT-MZLs corresponded to DLBCLs. No HT-MZLs harbored BCL2 and MYC and/or BCL6 rearrangements. Bone marrow involvement and higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase were significantly more common in HT-MZLs than in MZLs. Furthermore, upregulated BCL6, MUM1, C-MYC, and Ki-67 expression was observed more frequently in HT-MZLs than in MZLs. TBL1XR1 was the most frequently altered gene (63.6%) in HT-MZLs, followed by CCND3 (31.8%), CARD11, ID3, and TP53 (22.7%). A trend toward worse progression-free survival in patients with TBL1XR1 mutations was observed. Compared with MZLs and non-germinal center B-cell (GCB) type DLBCLs, significantly higher frequencies of TBL1XR1 and ID3 mutations were identified in HT-MZLs. PIM1 mutations frequently occurred in DLBCLs and were significantly associated with TBL1XR1 mutations but were mutated less in HT-MZLs that had TBL1XR1 mutations. The current findings reveal the clinicopathologic and genetic features of HT-MZLs, suggesting that these tumors might constitute a group distinct from MZL and de novo non-GCB type DLBCL. TBL1XR1 mutations may be considered a predictor of HT in MZL.",

        "AbstractText": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with high rates of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer (PCCRC), but further in-depth qualitative analyses are required to determine whether they result from inadequate surveillance or aggressive IBD cancer evolution. All IBD patients who had a colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosed between January 2015 to July 2019 and a recent (<4 years) surveillance colonoscopy at one of four English hospital trusts underwent root cause analyses as recommended by the World Endoscopy Organisation to identify plausible PCCRC causative factors. 61% (n=22/36) of the included IBD CRCs were PCCRCs. They developed in patients with high cancer risk factors (77.8%; n=28/36) requiring annual surveillance, yet 57.1% (n=20/35) had inappropriately delayed surveillance. Most PCCRCs developed in situations where (i) an endoscopically unresectable lesion was detected (40.9%; n=9/22), (ii) there was a deviation from the planned management pathway (40.9%; n=9/22) e.g. service, clinician or patient-related delays in acting on a detected lesion, or (iii) lesions were potentially missed as they were typically located within areas of active inflammation or post-inflammatory change (36.4%; n=8/22). IBD PCCRC prevention will require more proactive strategies to reduce endoscopic inflammatory burden, improve lesion optical characterisation, adherence to recommended surveillance intervals and patient acceptance of prophylactic colectomy. However, the significant proportion appearing to originate from non-adenomatous-looking mucosa which fail to yield neoplasia on biopsy yet display aggressive cancer evolution highlight the limitations of current surveillance. Emerging molecular biomarkers may play a role in enhancing cancer risk stratification in future clinical practice.",

        "AbstractText": "The role of autologous-allogeneic tandem stem cell transplantation (alloTSCT) followed by maintenance as upfront treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) is controversial. Between 2008 and 2014 a total of 217 MM patients with a median age of 51 years were included by 20 German centers within an open-label, parallel-group, multi-center clinical trial to compare alloTSCT to auto tandem transplantation TSCT (autoTSCT) followed by a 2-year maintenance therapy with thalidomide (100 mg/d) in both arms with respect to relapse/progression-free survival (PFS) and other relevant outcomes. A total of 178 patients underwent second SCT (allo n = 132 and auto n = 46). PFS at 4 years after the second SCT was 47% (CI: 38-55%) for alloTSCT and 35% (CI: 21-49%) for autoTSCT (p = 0.26). This difference increased to 22% at 8 years (p = 0.10). The cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and of relapse at 4 years were 13% (CI: 8-20%) and 2% (CI: 0.3-2%) (p = 0.044) and 40% (CI: 33-50%) and 63% (CI: 50-79%) for alloTSCT and autoTSCT (p = 0.04), respectively.

The dosing schedule of Oral-Aza (14 days/28-day cycle) allows for low exposure of azacitidine for an extended duration thereby facilitating a sustained therapeutic effect. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting the clinical impact of Oral-Aza in maintenance therapy remain to be fully understood. In this preclinical work, we explore the mechanistic basis of Oral-Aza/extended exposure to azacitidine through in vitro and in vivo modeling. In cell lines, extended exposure to azacitidine results in sustained DNMT1 loss, leading to durable hypomethylation, and gene expression changes. In mouse models, extended exposure to azacitidine, preferentially targets immature leukemic cells. In leukemic stem cell (LSC) models, the extended dose of azacitidine induces differentiation and depletes CD34+CD38- LSCs. Mechanistically, LSC differentiation is driven in part by increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression. Inhibition of MPO activity either by using an MPO specific inhibitor or blocking oxidative stress, a known mechanism of MPO, partly reverses the differentiation of LSCs. Overall, our pre-clinical work reveals novel mechanistic insights into oral-Aza and its ability to target leukemic stem cells.",

Whipple was educated at Princeton University (B.S., 1904) and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (M.D., 1908). He swiftly ascended the academic ranks, culminating in his appointment as Professor of Surgery at Columbia and Director of Surgical Services at Presbyterian Hospital in 1921. Whipple published three criteria (Whipple's triad) for evaluating hyperinsulinism secondary to pancreatic insulinoma. He also revived interest in portocaval anastomosis to reduce portal hypertension, determining it to be a consequence of liver disease. During his 40-year career, Whipple introduced the concept of multidisciplinary teams and prospective data collection. He also shaped the structure of surgical training as President of the American Surgical Association and Chairman of the American Board of Surgery. Beyond the walls of the operating room, Whipple was a Renaissance Man whose childhood in Persia (Iran) engendered a lifelong interest in the region's art, culture, history, and medicine.

        "AbstractText": "This is a summary of an article describing an ongoing study called MOUNTAINEER. This article was published in The Lancet Oncology in 2023. The study included 117 adults with metastatic HER2-positive colorectal cancer. The researchers wanted to know whether a combination of 2 drugs called tucatinib and trastuzumab could shrink the participants' cancer. The researchers also wanted to know whether receiving tucatinib alone could also shrink the participants' cancer. In this study, researchers found that 32 out of 84 participants had their tumors respond to treatment with tucatinib with trastuzumab. This was about 4 in 10 participants. This means that the tumors shrank by at least 30% or disappeared. Participants whose tumors responded to tucatinib with trastuzumab responded for a median of 12.4\u00a0months. 60 out of 84 participants had their tumors respond or remain about the same size after treatment with tucatinib with trastuzumab. This was about 7 in 10 participants. For those who received tucatinib with trastuzumab the median length of time participants lived during the study was 24.1\u00a0months and the median length of time participants lived during the study without their cancer growing or spreading was 8.2\u00a0months. 1 out of 30 participants had their tumors respond to treatment with tucatinib alone within 12\u00a0weeks. 19 out of 86 participants who received tucatinib with trastuzumab had serious medical problems, also called serious adverse events. This was about 2 in 10 participants. Not all of these serious adverse events were related to tucatinib with trastuzumab. 3 out of 30 participants who received tucatinib alone who had serious adverse events. This was 1 in 10 participants. Not all of these serious adverse events were related to tucatinib alone. Tucatinib with trastuzumab could be a good treatment option for people with HER2-positive colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. On January 19, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to the combination of two targeted drugs, tucatinib (Tukysa) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) for people with HER2-positive colorectal cancer that is metastatic or that cannot be treated with surgery. The FDA can grant accelerated approval for new treatments that fill unmet needs for patients with serious medical conditions.",

In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning models for disease diagnosis has increased. This study aimed to develop and validate a diagnostic model for early differentiation between MPE and BPE based on routine laboratory data. This was a retrospective observational cohort study. A total of 2352 newly diagnosed patients with pleural effusion (PE), between January 2008 and March 2021, were eventually enrolled. Among them, 1435, 466, and 451 participants were randomly assigned to the training, validation, and testing cohorts in a ratio of 3:1:1. Clinical parameters, including age, sex, and laboratory parameters of PE patients, were abstracted for analysis. Based on 81 candidate laboratory variables, five machine learning models, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model, logistic regression (LR) model, random forest (RF) model, support vector machine (SVM) model, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model were developed. Their respective diagnostic performances for MPE were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Among the five models, the XGBoost model exhibited the best diagnostic performance for MPE (area under the curve (AUC): 0.903, 0.918, and 0.886 in the training, validation, and testing cohorts, respectively). Additionally, the XGBoost model outperformed carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in pleural fluid (PF), serum, and the PF/serum ratio (AUC: 0.726, 0.699, and 0.692 in the training cohort; 0.763, 0.695, and 0.731 in the validation cohort; and 0.722, 0.729, and 0.693 in the testing cohort, respectively). Furthermore, compared with CEA, the XGBoost model demonstrated greater diagnostic power and sensitivity in diagnosing lung cancer-induced MPE. The development of a machine learning model utilizing routine laboratory biomarkers significantly enhances the diagnostic capability for distinguishing between MPE and BPE. The XGBoost model emerges as a valuable tool for the diagnosis of MPE.",

The study population was categorized into four groups by eGFR (mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 ) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation: group 1 (eGFR\u00a0<\u00a045), group 2 (eGFR \u2265\u00a045 to <\u00a060), group 3 (eGFR \u2265\u00a060 to <\u00a090), and group 4 (eGFR\u00a0\u2265\u00a090). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the incidence of pancreatic cancer until 2019 by comparing the eGFR groups. During the 3\u00a0493\u00a0589.05 person-years of follow-up, 1702 pancreatic cancer cases were identified. Compared with group 4 (eGFR\u00a0\u2265\u00a090), HRs and 95% CIs for the incidence of pancreatic cancer were 1.39 (1.24-1.56) for group 3 (eGFR \u2265\u00a060 to <\u00a090), 1.79 (1.47-2.16) for group 2 (eGFR \u2265\u00a045 to <\u00a060), and 2.05 (1.62-2.60) for group 1 (eGFR\u00a0<\u00a045) in the multivariate adjusted model. Decreased eGFR was significantly associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in Korean population. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between a decreased eGFR and the risk of pancreatic cancer in other ethnic groups.",

        "AbstractText": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) requires two cellular factors, microRNA-122 (miR-122) and poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2), for optimal replication. These host factors compete for binding to the 5' end of the single-stranded RNA genome to regulate the viral replication cycle. To understand how they interact with the RNA, we measured binding affinities of both factors for an RNA probe representing the 5' 45 nucleotides of the HCV genome (HCV45). Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed two, unequal miR-122 binding sites in HCV45, high-affinity (S1) and low-affinity (S2), differing roughly 100-fold in binding affinity. PCBP2 binds a site overlapping S2 with affinity similar to miR-122 binding to S2. PCBP2 circularizes the genome by also binding to the 3' UTR, bridging the 5' and 3' ends of the genome. By competing with PCBP2 for binding at S2, miR-122 disrupts PCBP2-mediated genome circularization. We show that the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B, also binds to HCV45, and that the binding affinity of NS5B is increased in the presence of miR-122, suggesting miR-122 promotes recruitment of the polymerase. We propose that competition between miR-122 and PCBP2 for HCV45 functions as a translation-to-replication switch, determining whether the RNA genome templates protein synthesis or RNA replication.",

        "AbstractText": "Myeloid cells comprise up to 50% of the total tumor mass in glioblastoma (GBM) and have been implicated in promoting tumor progression and immunosuppression. Modulating the response of myeloid cells to the tumor has emerged as a promising new approach for cancer treatment. In this regard, we focus on the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which has recently emerged as a novel immune modulator in peripheral tumors. We studied the TREM2 expression profile in various patient tumor samples and conducted single-cell transcriptomic analysis in both glioblastoma patients and the GL261 mouse glioma model. We utilized multiple mouse glioma models and employed state-of-the-art techniques such as in vivo two-photon imaging, spectrum flow cytometry, and in vitro co-culture assays to study TREM2 function in myeloid cell-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells, antigen presentation, and response of CD4+ T cells within the tumor hemispheres. Our research revealed significantly elevated levels of TREM2 expression in brain tumors compared to other types of tumors in patients. TREM2 was predominantly localized in tumor-associated myeloid cells and was highly expressed in nearly all microglia, as well as various subtypes of macrophages. Surprisingly, in pre-clinical glioma models, TREM2 deficiency did not confer a beneficial effect; instead, it accelerated glioma progression. Through detailed investigations, we determined that TREM2 deficiency impaired the ability of tumor-myeloid cells to phagocytose tumor cells and led to reduced expression of MHCII. This deficiency further significantly decreased the presence of CD4+ T cells within the tumor hemispheres. Our study unveiled a previously unrecognized protective role of tumor-myeloid TREM2. Specifically, we found TREM2 enhance the phagocytosis of tumor cells and promote an immune response by facilitating MHCII-associated CD4+ T cell responses against gliomas.",

In this work, we delve extensively into the history of genetic vaccines, their mechanisms of action, their strengths, and limitations, and ultimately highlight ongoing research in key areas for potential enhancement of both DNA and mRNA vaccines. Here, we assess the significance of the primary benefits and drawbacks associated with DNA and mRNA vaccination. We challenge the current lines of thought by highlighting that the existing drawbacks of DNA vaccination could potentially be more straightforward to address compared to those linked with mRNA vaccination. In our view, this suggests that DNA vaccines should remain viable contenders in the pursuit of the future of vaccination.",

Dietary habits, anthropometry and sample collection were conducted using standard and effective methods. Plant-based diet indices (PDIs) were calculated using a previously reported method. Faecal samples were analysed by untargeted metabolomics. Our study found that adherence to a healthy plant-based diet was inversely associated with the occurrence of GPLs. Metabolomic analysis identified six different metabolites correlated with GPLs, among which luteolin-related metabolites may be used as biomarkers of the association between PDIs and GPLs. In addition, the difference in N-acyl amides found in PDIs needs further verification. Our findings suggest that a healthy plant-based diet may have a protective effect against GPLs.",

        "AbstractText": "Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) is important to all aspects of health research. However, there are few examples of successful PPIE in statistical methodology research. One of the reasons for this relates to challenges in the identification of individuals interested in statistical methodology research projects, and ambiguities over the importance of PPIE to these projects. This project was conducted between August 2022 and August 2023. The aim is to report the process of the development of an accessible animation to describe what statistical methodology is and the importance of PPIE in statistical methodology research projects. For this, we combined storyboarding and scriptwriting with feedback from PPIE members and researchers. After three stages that incorporated feedback from the relevant stakeholders, we produced a final animation about PPIE in statistical methodology. The resulting animation used minimal text, simple animation techniques and was of short duration (<\u20093\u00a0min) to optimise the communication of the key messages clearly and effectively. The resulting animation provides a starting point for members of the public to learn about PPIE in statistical methodology\u00a0research and for methodologists who wish to conduct PPIE. We recommend further work to explore ways in which members of the public can be more meaningfully involved in methodology research. Patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) is when members of the public are directly involved in carrying out research projects. This is important because we as researchers want to make sure we are focusing on what matters most to patients, so that the research has as large an impact as possible. PPIE has typically been used in more applied research projects, such as clinical trials, but is equally as important in statistical methodology research, where we focus on making sure the statistical tools that we use in the applied projects are as good as possible. The aim of this project was to create a short animation that helps to explain the importance of PPIE in statistical methodology research projects. Researchers sometimes incorrectly assume that PPIE is less important in these projects as this type of research has a less obvious benefit to patients. The animation helps to further explain these concepts. It describes what statistical methodology research is and why involving members of the public is still important. This paper explains the process of developing the animation, including receiving feedback from members of the public to make sure the animation is accessible to as many people as possible. The result is a short, 3-min animation that is free to view on the NIHR website. This can be used by other researchers to help them when recruiting members of the public to their research projects.",

However, progress is still hindered as clinical benefit is only available for a fraction of patients. A lack of understanding of CAR-T cell behaviors in vivo at the single-cell level impedes their more extensive application in clinical practice. Mounting evidence suggests that single-cell sequencing techniques can help perfect the receptor design, guide gene-based T cell modification, and optimize the CAR-T manufacturing conditions, and all of them are essential for long-term immunosurveillance and more favorable clinical outcomes. The information generated by employing these methods also potentially informs our understanding of the numerous complex factors that dictate therapeutic efficacy and toxicities. In this review, we discuss the reasons why CAR-T immunotherapy fails in clinical practice and what this field has learned since the milestone of single-cell sequencing technologies. We further outline recent advances in the application of single-cell analyses in CAR-T immunotherapy. Specifically, we provide an overview of single-cell studies focusing on target antigens, CAR-transgene integration, and preclinical research and clinical applications, and then discuss how it will affect the future of CAR-T cell therapy.",

We aimed to examine the existence of predictive factors and cutoff points to determine which patients are the main candidates for heart-sparing RT techniques. Dosimetric data for left breast cancer was examined. RT plans were made at conventional doses to the breast and peripheral lymph nodes. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). 114 cases were evaluated by ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) analysis in the breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy groups. While only left lung volume (AUC: 0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.87, p\u2009=\u20090.002) was significant in BCS cases, in cases with mastectomy, left lung volume (AUC: 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.94, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and lung/heart volume ratio (AUC: 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.96, p\u2009=\u20090.001) had a significant relationship with the relevance of heart doses. The cutoff point of 1.92 was selected for the lung/heart volume ratio for the mastectomized patients. Moreover, the cutoff point 1154\u00a0cc and 1208\u00a0cc was determined for the left lung volume for the BCS and mastectomized patients, respectively. Various cutoff points in left breast RT can be used to predict whether RT plans will meet QUANTEC (Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic) heart dose limits. Evaluating only these few cutoff points before planning makes it possible to eliminate 70% of patients with BCS and 40% of patients with mastectomy from respiratory-controlled methods, which require time and effort. Patients with lung volume and lung/heart volume ratio smaller than the cutoff values can be considered primary candidates for heart-sparing techniques.",

        "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prominent global cancer with high mortality rates among human beings. Efficient diagnosis and treatment have always been a challenge for CRC management. Fluorescence guided cancer therapy, which combines diagnosis with therapy into one platform, has brought a new chance for achieving precise cancer theranostics. Among this, photosensitizers, applied in photodynamic therapy (PDT), given the integration of real-time imaging capacity and efficacious treatment feasibility, show great potential to serve as remarkable tools. Although much effort has been put into constructing photosensitizers for locating and destroying CRC cells, it is still in high need to develop novel photosensitizers to attain specific detection and fulfil effective therapy. Probe HTI was rational synthesized for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC. Spectrometric determination was carried out first, followed by the 1O2 generation ability test. Then, HTI was displayed in distinguishing CRC cells from normal cells Further, the PDT effect of the photosensitizer was studied in vitro. Additionally, HTI was used in CRC BALB/c nude mice model to validate its viscosity labelling and tumor suppression characteristics. We successfully fabricated a mitochondrial targeting probe, HTI, together with remarkable viscosity sensitivity, ultralow background interference, and excellent 1O2 generation capacity. HTI was favorably applied to the viscosity detection, displaying a 11-fold fluorescent intensity enhancement in solvents from 1.57 cp to 2043 cp. Then, it was demonstrated that HTI could distinguish CRC cells from normal cells upon the difference in mitochondrial viscosity. Moreover, HTI was qualified for producing 1O2 with high efficiency in cells, supported by the sparkling signals of DCFH after incubation with HTI under light irradiation. More importantly, the viscosity labelling and tumor suppression performance in CRC CDX model was determined, enriching the multifunctional validation of HTI in vivo. In this study, HTI was demonstrated to show a sensitive response to mitochondrial viscosity and possess a high 1O2 generation capacity. Both in vitro cell imaging and in vivo tumor treatment trials proved that HTI was effectively served as a robust scaffold for tumor labeling and CRC cells clearance. This breakthrough discovery held immense potential for advancing the early diagnosis and management of CRC through PDT. By leveraging HTI's properties, medical professionals could benefit from improved diagnostic accuracy and targeted treatment in CRC management, ultimately leading to enhanced patient outcomes.",

Poor clinical outcome of HCC patients is attributed to a small population of cancer cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this work, we studied the effect of inhibiting the enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase known to be overexpressed in CSCs, using tazemetostat (Taz). The effect of Taz was assessed in the HCC cell line (HEPG2) and Hepatitis B virus-transfected HEPG2 (HBV/HEPG2) cells. MTT assay showed a significant decrease in HEPG2 cells viability after 48\u00a0h treatment with either 0.5, 1, 4 or 6\u00a0\u03bcM Taz. HEPG2 and HBV/HEPG2 cells were incubated with either 0.5 or 1\u00a0\u03bcM Taz for 48\u00a0h, and then, the cells and supernatants were collected for protein expression analysis of EZH2, CD13, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and \u03b2-catenin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Taz showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of EZH2, CD13 and \u03b2-catenin in HEPG2 and HBV/HEPG2 cells. Also, EpCAM protein levels\u00a0were significantly decreased in HBV/HEPG2 but not in HEPG2 cell line alone. Our results indicate that Taz inhibition of EZH2 leads to downregulation of \u03b2-catenin signaling and eventually decreased expression of CD13 and EpCAM, which are characteristic for CSCs. The present study suggests that Taz could be a promising treatment for HCC including HBV-induced HCC that might be used in combination with radio/chemotherapy to target CSCs and prevent tumor relapse.",

Our previous study has substantiated the pivotal role of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in protecting hepatocytes and mediating iron metabolism in the liver. This study aimed to explore the specific mechanisms underlying the regulation of iron metabolism by Cav-1 in NAFLD. Hepatocyte-specific Cav-1 overexpression mice and knockout mice were used in this study. Cav-1-knockdown of RAW264.7 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes were performed to verify the changes in vitro. Moreover, a high-fat diet and palmitic acid plus oleic acid treatment were utilized to construct a NAFLD model in vivo and in vitro, respectively, while a high-iron diet was used to construct an in vivo iron overload model. Besides, iron concentration, the expression of Cav-1 and iron metabolism-related proteins in liver tissue or serum were detected using iron assay kit, Prussian blue staining, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemical staining and ELISA. The related indicators of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress were evaluated by the corresponding reagent kit and staining. Significant disorder of lipid and iron metabolism occurred in NAFLD. The expression of Cav-1 was decreased in NAFLD hepatocytes (P\u2009<\u20090.05), accompanied by iron metabolism disorder. Cav-1 enhanced the iron storage capacity of hepatocytes by activating the ferritin light chain/ferritin heavy chain pathway in NAFLD, subsequently alleviating the oxidative stress induced by excess ferrous ions in the liver. Further, CD68+CD163+ macrophages expressing Cav-1 were found to accelerate iron accumulation in the liver, which was contrary to the effect of Cav-1 in hepatocytes. Positive correlations were also observed between the serum Cav-1 concentration and the serum iron-related protein levels in NAFLD patients and healthy volunteers (P\u2009<\u20090.05). These findings confirm that Cav-1 is an essential target protein that regulates iron and lipid metabolic homeostasis. It is a pivotal molecule for predicting and protecting against the development of NAFLD.",

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, is predominantly associated with advanced/metastatic disease. The interaction between tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in tumor microenvironment is known to be essential for regulating tumor progression and metastasis, but the underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of RNA-binding protein Musashi-2 (MSI2) in CAFs in promoting non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) invasiveness and metastatic spread, remain obscure. Genomic and proteomic database analyses were performed to evaluate the potential clinical significance of MSI2 in NSCLC tumor and stromal clinical specimens. Molecular approaches were used to modify MSI2 in CAFs and determine its functional role in NSCLC cell motility in vitro using 2D and 3D models, and in metastasis in a xenograft mouse model using live-cell imaging. MSI2, both gene and protein, is upregulated in NSCLC tissues and is associated with poor prognosis and high metastatic risk in patients. Interestingly, MSI2 is also upregulated in NSCLC stroma and activated fibroblasts, including CAFs. Depletion of MSI2 in CAFs by CRISPR-Cas9 strongly inhibits NSCLC cell migration and invasion in vitro, and attenuates local and distant metastatic spread of NSCLC cells in vivo. The crosstalk between CAFs and NSCLC cells occurs via paracrine signaling, which is regulated by MSI2 in CAFs via IL-6. The secreted IL-6 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in NSCLC cells, which drives metastasis. Our findings reveal for the first time that MSI2 in CAFs is important in CAF-mediated NSCLC cell invasiveness and metastasis via IL-6 paracrine signaling. Therefore, targeting the MSI2/IL-6 axis in CAFs could be effective in combating NSCLC metastasis.",

        "AbstractText": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial malignant solid tumor in children. Due to drug resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, mainly due to the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), some children still have a poor prognosis. Therefore, researchers have focused their attention on CSCs. Our research group successfully constructed cancer stem cell-like cells named Piwil2-iCSCs by reprogramming human preputial fibroblasts (FBs) with the PIWIL2 gene in the early stage, and Piwil2-iCSCs were confirmed to induce the formation of embryonic tumors. PiRNAs, noncoding small RNAs that interact with PIWI proteins, play important roles in a variety of tumors. Therefore, our study aimed to explore the role of differentially expressed (DE) piRNAs derived from sequencing of Piwil2-iCSCs in NB. The DE piRNAs in Piwil2-iCSCs were screened using high-throughput sequencing and further verified in NB tissues and cells. An unknown piRNA, named piRNA-MW557525, showed obvious downregulation in NB. Thus we studied the effect of piRNA-MW557525 on the biological behavior of NB through in vitro and in vivo experiments. On this basis, we successfully constructed a stably transfected NB cell line overexpressing piRNA-MW557525 and performed transcriptome sequencing to further explore the mechanism of piRNA-MW557525 in NB. In vitro, piRNA-MW557525 inhibited NB cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced apoptosis; in vivo, piRNA-MW557525 significantly reduced the volume and weight of tumors and inhibited their proliferation, migration and invasion. piRNA-MW557525 overexpression induced G0/G1 phase arrest in NB cells via activation of the P53-P21-CDK2-Cyclin E signaling pathway thus inhibiting NB growth. Our findings show that piRNA-MW557525 functions as a tumor suppressor gene in NB and may serve as an innovative biomarker and possible therapeutic target for NB.",

This rare disease is characterised by dismal prognosis. In recent years, there has been a deeper understanding of RT molecular pathogenesis, and disruptions of apoptosis (TP53) and proliferation (CDKN2A, MYC, NOTCH1) has been described as typical aberrations in RT. A single-institution cohort of 33 RT patients were investigated by karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism/copy number (CN) arrays. Most of RTs were typically manifested by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, among the remaining cases one was classified as high-grade B-cell lymphoma with 11q aberrations. The most frequent alterations (40-60% of cases) were represented by MYC rearrangement/gain, deletions of TP53 and CDKN2A, IGH rearrangement and 13q14 deletion. Several other frequent lesions included losses of 14q24.1-q32.33, 7q31.33-q36.3, and gain of 5q35.2. Analysis of 13 CLL/SLL-RT pairs showed that RT arised from the CLL/SLL by acquiring of 10\u2009~\u200912 cytogenetic or CN lesions/case, but without acquisition of loss of heterozygosity regions. Our result affirmed the higher genetic complexity in RT than CLL/SLL and confirmed the linear features of RT clonal evolution as predominant.

This cellular diversity can be assessed by measuring DNA methylation patterns. The loci with variable methylation patterns are informative of cellular heterogeneity and may serve as biomarkers of diseases and developmental progression. Cell-to-cell methylation heterogeneity can be evaluated through single-cell methylomes or computational techniques for pooled cells. However, the feasibility and performance of these approaches to precisely estimate methylation heterogeneity require further assessment. Here, we proposed model-based methods adopted from a mathematical framework originally from biodiversity, to estimate genome-wide DNA methylation heterogeneity. We evaluated the performance of our models and the existing methods with feature comparison, and tested on both synthetic datasets and real data. Overall, our methods have demonstrated advantages over others because of their better correlation with the actual heterogeneity. We also demonstrated that methylation heterogeneity offers an additional layer of biological information distinct from the conventional methylation level. In the case studies, we showed that distinct profiles of methylation heterogeneity in CG and non-CG methylation can predict the regulatory roles between genomic elements in Arabidopsis. This opens up a new direction for plant epigenomics. Finally, we demonstrated that our score might be able to identify loci in human cancer samples as putative biomarkers for early cancer detection. We adopted the mathematical framework from biodiversity into three model-based methods for analyzing genome-wide DNA methylation heterogeneity to monitor cellular heterogeneity. Our methods, namely MeH, have been implemented, evaluated with existing methods, and are open to the research community.",

        "AbstractText": "Genetic counselling aims to identify, and address, patient needs while facilitating informed decision-making about genetic testing and promoting empowerment and adaptation to genetic information. Increasing demand for cancer genetic testing and genetic counsellor workforce capacity limitations may impact the quality of genetic counselling provided. The use of a validated genetic-specific screening tool, the Genetic Psychosocial Risk Instrument (GPRI), may facilitate patient-centred genetic counselling. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and implementation of using the GPRI in improving patient outcomes after genetic counselling and testing for an inherited cancer predisposition. The PersOnalising gEneTIc Counselling (POETIC) trial is a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial using a randomised control trial to assess the effectiveness of the GPRI in improving patient empowerment (primary outcome), while also assessing implementation from the perspective of clinicians and the healthcare service. Patients referred for a cancer risk assessment to the conjoint clinical genetics service of two metropolitan hospitals in Victoria, Australia, who meet the eligibility criteria and consent to POETIC will be randomised to the usual care or intervention group. Those in the intervention group will complete the GPRI prior to their appointment with the screening results available for the clinicians' use during the appointment. Appointment audio recordings, clinician-reported information about the appointment, patient-reported outcome measures, and clinical data will be used to examine the effectiveness of using the GPRI. Appointment audio recordings, health economic information, and structured interviews will be used to examine the implementation of the GPRI. The POETIC trial takes a pragmatic approach by deploying the GPRI as an intervention in the routine clinical practice of a cancer-specific clinical genetics service that is staffed by a multidisciplinary team of genetics and oncology clinicians. Therefore, the effectiveness and implementation evidence generated from this real-world health service setting aims to optimise the relevance of the outcomes of this trial to the practice of genetic counselling while enhancing the operationalisation of the screening tool in routine practice.

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer subtyping based on gene expression data is important for identifying patient subgroups with differing survival prognosis to facilitate customized treatment strategies for each subtype of patients. Unsupervised clustering methods are the traditional approach for clustering patients into subtypes. However, since those methods cluster patients based only on gene expression data, the resulting clusters may not always be relevant to the survival outcome of interest. In recent years, semi-supervised and supervised methods have been proposed, which leverage the survival outcome data to identify clusters more relevant to survival prognosis. This paper aims to compare the performance of different clustering methods for identifying clinically prognostic lung cancer subtypes based on two lung adenocarcinoma datasets. For each method, we clustered patients into two clusters and assessed the difference in patient survival time between clusters. Unsupervised methods were found to have large logrank p-values and no significant results in most cases. Semi-supervised and supervised methods had improved performance over unsupervised methods and very significant p-values. These results indicate that unsupervised methods are not capable of identifying clusters with significant differences in survival prognosis in most cases, while supervised and semi-supervised methods can better cluster patients into clinically useful subtypes.",

        "AbstractText": "Despite a 40% reduction in breast cancer mortality over the last 30\u00a0years, not all groups have benefited equally from these gains. A consistent link between later stage of diagnosis and disparities in breast cancer mortality has been observed by race, socioeconomic status, and rurality. Therefore, ensuring equitable geographic access to screening mammography represents an important priority for reducing breast cancer disparities. Access to breast cancer screening was evaluated in Delaware, a state that experiences an elevated burden from breast cancer but is otherwise representative of the US in terms of race and urban-rural characteristics. We first conducted a catchment analysis of mammography facilities. Finding evidence of disparities by race and rurality, we next conducted a location-allocation analysis to identify candidate locations for the establishment of new mammography facilities to optimize equitable access. A catchment analysis using the ArcGIS Pro Service Area analytic tool characterized the geographic distribution of mammography sites and Breast Imaging Centers of Excellence (BICOEs). Poisson regression analyses identified census tract-level correlates of access. Next, the ArcGIS Pro Location-Allocation analytic tool identified candidate locations for the placement of additional mammography sites in Delaware according to several sets of breast cancer screening guidelines. The catchment analysis showed that for each standard deviation increase in the number of Black women in a census tract, there were 68% (95% CI 38-85%) fewer mammography units and 89% (95% CI 60-98%) fewer BICOEs. The more rural counties in the state accounted for 41% of the population but only 22% of the BICOEs. The results of the location-allocation analysis depended on which set of screening guidelines were adopted, which included increasing mammography sites in communities with a greater proportion of younger Black women and in rural areas. The results of this study illustrate how catchment and location-allocation analytic tools can be leveraged to guide the equitable selection of new mammography facility locations as part of a larger strategy to close breast cancer disparities.",

        "AbstractText": "Understanding the role of naturally acquired (i.e., infection-induced) human papillomavirus (HPV) antibodies against reinfection is important given the high incidence of this sexually transmitted infection. However, the protective effect of naturally acquired antibodies in terms of the level of protection, duration, and differential effect by sex remains incompletely understood. We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to (1) strengthen the evidence on the association between HPV antibodies acquired through past infection and subsequent type-specific HPV detection, (2) investigate the potential influence of type-specific HPV antibody levels, and (3) assess differential effects by HIV status. We searched Embase and Medline databases to identify studies which prospectively assessed the risk of type-specific HPV detection by baseline homologous HPV serostatus among unvaccinated individuals. Random-effect models were used to pool the measures of association of naturally acquired HPV antibodies against subsequent incident detection and persistent HPV positivity. Sources of heterogeneity for each type were assessed through subgroup analyses stratified by sex, anatomical site of infection, male sexual orientation, age group, and length of follow-up period. Evidence of a dose-response relationship of the association between levels of baseline HPV antibodies and type-specific HPV detection was assessed. Finally, we pooled estimates from publications reporting associations between HPV serostatus and type-specific HPV detection by baseline HIV status. We identified 26 publications (16 independent studies, with 62,363 participants) reporting associations between baseline HPV serostatus and incident HPV detection, mainly for HPV-16 and HPV-18, the most detected HPV type. We found evidence of protective effects of baseline HPV seropositivity and subsequent detection of HPV DNA (0.70, 95% CI 0.61-0.80, NE\u2009=\u200911) and persistent HPV positivity (0.65, 95% CI 0.42-1.01, NE\u2009=\u20095) mainly for HPV-16 among females, but not among males, nor for HPV-18. Estimates from 8 studies suggested a negative dose-response relationship between HPV antibody level and subsequent detection among females. Finally, we did not observe any differential effect by baseline HIV status due to the limited number of studies available. We did not find evidence that naturally acquired HPV antibodies protect against subsequent HPV positivity in males and provide only modest protection among females for HPV-16. One potential limitation to\u00a0the interpretation of these\u00a0findings\u00a0is potential misclassification biases due to different causes.",

        "AbstractText": "The hypoxia-responsive long non-coding RNA, RP11-367G18.1, has recently been reported to induce histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16Ac) through its variant 2; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. RNA pull-down assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were performed to identify RP11-367G18.1 variant 2-binding partner. The molecular events were examined utilizing western blot analysis, real-time PCR, luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and chromatin isolation by RNA purification assays. The migration, invasion, soft agar colony formation, and in vivo xenograft experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of RP11-367G18.1 variant 2-YY1 complex on tumor progression. In this study, RNA sequencing data revealed that hypoxia and RP11-367G18.1 variant 2 co-regulated genes were enriched in tumor-related pathways. YY1 was identified as an RP11-367G18.1 variant 2-binding partner that activates the H4K16Ac mark. YY1 was upregulated under hypoxic conditions and served as a target gene for hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1. RP11-367G18.1 variant 2 colocalized with YY1 and H4K16Ac in the nucleus under hypoxic conditions. Head and neck cancer tissues had higher levels of RP11-367G18.1 and YY1 which were associated with poor patient outcomes. RP11-367G18.1 variant 2-YY1 complex contributes to hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, invasion, and tumorigenicity. YY1 regulated hypoxia-induced genes dependent on RP11-367G18.1 variant 2. RP11-367G18.1 variant 2-YY1 complex mediates the tumor-promoting effects of hypoxia, suggesting that this complex can be targeted as a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.",

To further evaluate the involvement of oncogenic HPV types in CRC, 40 frozen neoplastic and 40 adjacent colonic tissues collected from Italian patients were analyzed by Luminex-based assays that detect a broad spectrum of HPV types, i.e. Alpha (n\u2009=\u200921), Beta (n\u2009=\u200946) and Gamma HPVs (n\u2009=\u200952). In addition, 125 frozen CRC samples and 70 surrounding mucosal tissues were collected from Czech patients and analyzed by broad spectrum PCR protocols: (i) FAP59/64, (ii) FAPM1 and (iii) CUT combined with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Using Luminex-basedassays, DNA from HPV16 was detected in 5% (2/40) CRC tissues from Italian patients. One HPV16 DNA-positive CRC case was subsequently confirmed positive for E6*I mRNA. Cutaneous beta HPV types were detected in 10% (4/40) adjacent tissues only, namely HPV111 (n\u2009=\u20093) and HPV120 (n\u2009=\u20091), while gamma HPV168 (n\u2009=\u20091) and HPV199 (n\u2009=\u20091) types were detected in adjacent and in tumor tissues, respectively. The NGS analysis of the CRC Czech samples identified HPV sequences from mucosal alpha-3 (HPV89), alpha-7 (HPV18, 39, 68 and 70) and alpha-10 species (HPV11), as well as cutaneous beta-1 (HPV20, 24, 93, 98, 105,124) beta-2 (HPV23), beta-3 (HPV49) and gamma-1 species (HPV205). Our findings indicate that HPV types belonging to the mucosal alpha, and the 'cutaneous' beta and gamma genera can be detected in the colonic mucosal samples with a low prevalence rate and a low number of HPV reads by Luminex and NGS, respectively.

        "AbstractText": "Ovarian cancer is commonly associated with a poor prognosis due to metastasis and chemoresistance. PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial part in regulating various physiological and pathophysiological processes in cancer cells. The ATdb database and \"CuratedOvarianData\" were used to evaluate the effect of kinases on ovarian cancer survival. The gene expression in ovarian cancer cells was detected by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. The effects of gene knockdown or overexpression in vitro were evaluated by wound healing assay, cell transwell assay, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis, protein structure analysis, co-immunoprecipitation assay, nuclear-cytoplasmic separation, and in vitro kinase assay were applied to demonstrate the PINK1-PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) interaction and the effect of this interaction. The metastasis experiments for ovarian cancer xenografts were performed in female BALB/c nude mice. PINK1 was strongly associated with a poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients and promoted metastasis and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells. Although the canonical PINK1/PRKN (parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) pathway showed weak effects in ovarian cancer, PINK1 was identified to interact with PTEN and phosphorylate it at Serine179. Remarkably, the phosphorylation of PTEN resulted in the inactivation of the phosphatase activity, leading to an increase in AKT (AKT serine/threonine kinase) activity. Moreover, PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of PTEN impaired the nuclear import of PTEN, thereby enhancing the cancer cells' ability to resist chemotherapy and metastasize. PINK1 interacts with and phosphorylates PTEN at Serine179, resulting in the activation of AKT and the inhibition of PTEN nuclear import. PINK1 promotes ovarian cancer metastasis and chemotherapy resistance through the regulation of PTEN. These findings offer new potential therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer management.",

Transcriptomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were used to screen differentially expressed CirSLC7A6 in A2780 and A2780/CDDP cells. RT-qPCR was performed to examine the expression levels of CirSLC7A6, miR-2682-5p, and SLC7A6. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, and cell migration and invasion were analyzed using wound healing and Transwell assays. Cell suspensions were inoculated into the subcutaneous tissues of the bilateral interscapular region of nude mice. Saline, cisplatin, baicalein and cisplatin plus baicalein were intraperitoneally injected to observe the effects on tumor growth. Toxicity analyses in the liver and kidney were performed using H&E staining. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of CirSLC7A6, miR-2682-5p, and SLC7A6 in tumor tissues, and western blot analysis was carried out to measure protein expression levels. CirSLC7A6 was markedly upregulated in A2780/CDDP cells compared with the A2780 cells. CirSLC7A6 knockdown notably increased the expression of miR-2682-5p and decreased SLC7A6 expression. The rates of inhibition and apoptosis in the group treated with a combination of cisplatin and baicalein were significantly higher than those of the cisplatin and baicalein groups of A2780/CDDP shCirSLC7A6 cells. In A2780/CDDP shCirSLC7A6 cells, migration and invasion were significantly higher in the cisplatin and baicalein groups, compared with the combined treatment group. In the A2780/CDDP shCirSLC7A6 cell xenograft, the tumor weight of the combined treatment group was significantly lower than that of the cisplatin and baicalein groups. In addition, the combination of cisplatin and baicalein did not induce higher levels of toxicity in the liver or kidney. Baicalein alone and in combination with cisplatin notably reduced the expression of CirSLC7A6 and SLC7A6, and increased the expression of miR-2682-5p in the A2780/CDDP shCirSLC7A6 cell xenograft. In A2780/CDDP shCirSLC7A6 cells, the expression levels of P-Akt, P-mTOR, P-Erk, Bcl-2 and MMP2 were lower in the combined treatment group than in the control group.

        "AbstractText": "The occurrence and progression of tumors can be established through a complex interplay among tumor cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasive factors and immune cells. In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) to evaluate the pseudotime trajectory and spatial interactive relationship between EMT-invasive malignant tumors and immune cells in primary colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues at different stages (stage I/II and stage III with tumor deposit). Our research characterized the spatiotemporal relationship among different invasive tumor programs by constructing pseudotime endpoint-EMT-invasion tumor programs (EMTPs) located at the edge of ST, utilizing evolution trajectory analysis integrated with EMT-invasion genes. Strikingly, the invasive and expansive process of tumors undergoes remarkable spatial reprogramming of regulatory and immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), regulatory T cells (Treg), and exhausted T cells (Tex). These EMTP-adjacent cell are linked to EMT-related invasion genes, especially the C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL1) and CXCL8 genes that are important for CRC prognosis. Interestingly, the EMTPs in stage I mainly produce an inflammatory margin invasive niche, while the EMTPs in stage III tissues likely produce a hypoxic pre-invasive niche. Our data demonstrate the crucial role of regulatory and immunosuppressive cells in tumor formation and progression of CRC. This study provides a framework to delineate the spatiotemporal invasive niche in CRC samples.",

Our aim is to identify and describe the potential categories of moral courage among nurses and to clarify the coping styles of nurses under different categories. A cross-sectional study was conducted using three data collection tools: a self-designed general information questionnaire, a Chinese version of the Moral Courage Scale, and a Trait Coping Style Questionnaire. Three hundred fourteen nurses from a tertiary hospital in Heilongjiang Province, China, were analysed using potential profile analysis, descriptive analysis, and Mann-Whitney U test data. The latent profile analysis (LPA) results indicate that the two-profile model is the most suitable and supports the existence of two different moral courage profiles: the low moral courage group (60.51%) and the high moral courage group (39.49%), with a high relative entropy value (0.922). The results point to a good profile solution, and there are significant differences between the two profiles. The Mann-Whitney U-test results showed that the positive coping scores of the high moral courage group were significantly higher than those of the low moral courage group, and the negative coping scores of the high moral courage group were significantly lower than those of the low moral courage group. Our results reveal the heterogeneity of moral courage in the nurse sample and indicate that nurses in the high moral courage group tend to choose positive coping styles, while nurses in the low moral courage group are more likely to develop negative coping emotions. This provides important significance and reference value for nursing managers, who can propose customised management plans based on the types of moral courage of the nursing community and the coping styles under different categories.",

Eligibility criteria consisted of stage IA high-grade EC, lesions confined to endometrium, normal hepatic and renal function, normal urine test, no contraindication for fertility-sparing treatment and no prior therapy. Urine samples were analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), a technique chosen for its high sensitivity and resolution, allows for rapid, accurate identification and quantification of metabolites, providing a comprehensive metabolic profile and facilitating the discovery of potential biomarkers. Analytical techniques were employed to determine distinct metabolites and altered metabolic pathways. The statistical analyses were performed using univariate and multivariate analyses, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to discover and validate the potential biomarker models. A total of 108 different urine metabolomes were identified between CR and PT groups. These metabolites were enriched in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, one carbon pool by folate, and some amino acid metabolisms pathways. A panel consisting of Baicalin, 5beta-1,3,7 (11)-Eudesmatrien-8-one, Indolylacryloylglycine, Edulitine, and Physapubenolide were selected as biomarkers, which demonstrated the best predictive ability with the AUC values of 0.982/0.851 in training/10-fold-cross-validation group, achieving a sensitivity of 0.975 and specificity of 0.967, respectively. The urine metabolic analysis revealed the metabolic changes in EC patients during the fertility-sparing treatment.

Four validated self-report measures assessed HRQoL as measured by the SF-12, Resilience, Hope, and Perceived Social Support (MSPs). The mediating roles of resilience between HRQoL and the fitness of the proposed model were investigated using path analysis. SPSS version 24 software and Lisrel 8.8 software were used for data analysis. The results of path analysis showed that the final model had a good fit to the data (Chi-Square/ degrees of freedom (Normed Chi2)\u2009=\u20092.08, RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.014, goodness fit index\u2009=\u20090.99, both comparative fit index\u2009=\u20090.99 both CFI\u2009=\u20090.99 and IFI\u2009=\u20091). In this model, age and psychosocial factors predicted health-related quality of life. Age and psychosocial factors especially social support are important components in predicting health-related quality of life among those suffering from breast cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "With the development of minimally invasive technology, the trauma caused by surgery get smaller, At the same time, the specimen extraction surgery through the natural orifice is more favored by experts domestically and abroad, robotic surgery has further promoted the development of specimen extraction surgery through the natural orifice. The aim of current study is to compare the short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSES ) and transabdominal specimen extraction(TRSE ) in median rectal cancer surgery. From January 2020 to January 2023, 87 patients who underwent the NOSES or TRSE at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were included in the study, 4 patients were excluded due to liver metastasis. Of these, 50 patients were in the TRSE and 33 patients in the NOSES. Short-term efficacy was compared in the two groups. The NOSES group had less operation time (P\u2009<\u20090.001), faster recovery of gastrointestinal function (P\u2009<\u20090.001), shorter abdominal incisions (P\u2009<\u20090.001), lower pain scores(P\u2009<\u20090.001). lower Inflammatory indicators of the white blood cell count and C-reactive protein content at 1, 3, and 5 days after surgery (P\u2009<\u20090.001, P\u2009=\u20090.037). There were 9 complications in the NOSES group and 11 complications in the TRSE group(P\u2009=\u20090.583). However, there were no wound complications in the NOSES group. The number of postoperative hospital stays seems to be same in the two groups. And there was no significant difference in postoperative anus function (P\u2009=\u20090.591). This study shows that NOSES and TRSE can achieve similar radical treatment effects, NOSES is a feasible and safe way to take specimens for rectal cancer surgery in accordance with the indication for NOSES.",

Antimicrobial assays against Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans were performed. The microbes' ultrastructural morphology was assessed using Transmission Electron Microscopy. The effect on microbial biofilm formation was tested by a broth microdilution. Cell viability was assessed with MTT assay. The anti-inflammatory effect was investigated by measuring inhibition of nitric oxide production. Enamel microhardness was measured via Vickers microhardness testing. The enamel chemical composition was investigated with Fourier Transform Spectrometer. The enamel surface morphology and fluoride content were examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy\u00a0and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The results show synergistic effects of \u03b1-MG and LME on antimicrobial activity and antibiofilm formation without cytotoxicity at a therapeutic dose. At a higher dose, the tooth gel inhibited proliferation of cancer cell line. Enamel microhardness was increased after brushing with the tooth gel plus fluoride. A large amount of fluoride was detected on the enamel surface. The tooth gel containing \u03b1-MG and LME synergized its antimicrobial activity and antibiofilm formation and inhibited oral cancer cell proliferation. Incorporating fluoride into the tooth gel increased enamel microhardness. Thus, the herbal tooth gel containing \u03b1-MG and LME plus fluoride may be useful for preventing dental caries and promoting oral health.",

Screening patients with at least one adnexal mass on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two trained junior physicians evaluated each mass using the two scoring systems. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to test the diagnostic performance of each system. A total of 144 adnexal masses were retrospectively collected. Forty masses were histologically diagnosed as malignant. Compared with premenopausal women, postmenopausal women had a much higher rate of malignant masses. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of the SRR was 97.5% (95% CI: 86.8 -99.9%), 82.7% (95% CI: 74.0 -89.4%), 68.4% (95% CI: 58.7 -76.8%) and 98.9% (95% CI: 92.5 -99.8%).

Based on Andersen's behavioural model of health services use, the current study aimed to identify the predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with treatment-seeking status among people self-reporting the four main NCDs in India. Cross-sectional study using secondary data. Usual residents aged 15-49 who self-reported cancer (n\u2009=\u20091 056), chronic respiratory disease (n\u2009=\u200910 534), diabetes (n\u2009=\u200913 501), and/or heart disease (n\u2009=\u20095 861) during the fifth National Family and Health Survey (NFHS-5), 2019-21, were included. Treatment-seeking status was modelled separately for each disease using survey-adjusted multivariable logistic regression. 3.9% of India\u00b4s 15-49-year-old population self-reported\u2009\u2265\u20091 of the four main NCDs (0.1% cancer, 1.4% chronic respiratory disease, 2% diabetes, 0.8% heart disease). The percentage that had sought treatment for their condition(s) was 82%, 68%, 76%, and 74%, respectively. Greater age and having\u2009\u2265\u20091 of the NCDs were associated with greater odds of seeking disease-specific treatment. People in the middle or lower wealth quintiles had lower odds of seeking care than the wealthiest 20% for all conditions. Women with diabetes or chronic respiratory disease had greater odds of seeking disease-specific treatment than men. Muslims, the unmarried, and those with health insurance had greater odds of seeking cancer treatment than Hindus, the married, and the uninsured. Predisposing, enabling, and need factors are associated with treatment-seeking status among people reporting the four major NCDs in India, suggesting that multiple processes inform the decision to seek disease-specific care among aware cases. Successfully encouraging and enabling as many people as possible who knowingly live with major NCDs to seek treatment is likely contingent on a multi-pronged approach to healthcare policy-making. The need to improve treatment uptake through accessible healthcare is further underscored by the fact that one-fifth (cancer) to one-third (chronic respiratory disease) of 15-49-year-olds reporting a major NCD have never sought treatment despite being aware of their condition.",

        "AbstractText": "A diagnosis of cancer during pregnancy or within one year after the end of pregnancy is a major clinical and public health issue. The current study aimed at estimating the incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer (PAC) and assessing whether the risk of abortion is increased in women diagnosed with cancer. This population-based cohort study used the regional healthcare utilization (HCU) databases of Lombardy, the largest region in Italy, to identify the women who delivered between 2010 and 2020. PAC were identified by oncological ICD-9-CM codes reported in the hospital discharge forms. We computed the ratio of PAC cases to the total number of pregnancies. Following a diagnosis of PAC, the prevalence ratio (PR) of abortion and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), was estimated using a log-binomial model adjusted for maternal age. During the study period, 926 women who gave birth (1.29 cases per 1000 births) and 341 women who had an abortion (1.52 cases per 1000 abortions) were diagnosed with PAC. Regardless of the outcome of pregnancy, the risk of PAC increased with increasing age. The rate of PAC was initially lower among births, but it came very close to the rate of PAC among abortions in the last two calendar years. The proportion of abortions among women with PAC gradually decreased from 27.7% in 2010-2012 to 18.5% in 2019-2020 (p-value\u2009<\u20090.001). Overall, a diagnosis of PAC was related to an approximately 10% increased risk of abortion (PR\u2009=\u20091.11, 95%CI:1.01-1.22). However, no association was observed in 2019-2020 (PR\u2009=\u20090.87, 95%CI:0.65-1.17). Considering only diagnoses made during the first trimester of pregnancy, the risk of abortion was about 2.5 times higher (PR\u2009=\u20092.53, 95%CI:2.05-3.11) and the risk of induced abortion was almost 4 times higher (PR\u2009=\u20093.71, 95%CI:2.82-4.90). In this population the risk of abortion was about 10% higher in women with PAC than in women without PAC. However, this association tended to decrease in more recent calendar periods. This trend seemed to be influenced more by spontaneous than by induced abortions.",

Our previous report has demonstrated that circCOL1A1 (hsa_circ_0044556) functions as an oncogene in CRC, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis has also revealed the strong association between circCOL1A1 and angiogenesis. However, the mechanism of circCOL1A1 or exosomal circCOL1A1 in CRC angiogenesis remains elusive. Purified exosomes from CRC cells were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analyzing, electron microscopy and western blot. qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry or western blot were employed to test the expression of circCOL1A1, EIF4A3, Smad pathway and angiogenic markers. Cell proliferation of HUVECs was monitored by CCK-8 assay. The migratory and angiogenic capabilities of HUVECs were detected by wound healing and tube formation assay, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down and FISH assays were used to detect the interactions among circCOL1A1, EIF4A3 and Smad2/3 mRNA. The in vitro findings were verified in xenograft model. CRC cell-derived exosomal circCOL1A1 promoted angiogenesis of HUVECs via recruiting EIF4A3. EIF4A3 was elevated in CRC tissues, and it stimulated angiogenesis of HUVECs through directly binding and stabilizing Smad2/3 mRNA. Moreover, exosomal circCOL1A1 promoted angiogenesis via inducing Smad2/3 signaling pathway in vitro, and it also accelerated tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo.

The purpose of this study was to construct and validate a prognostic signature related to ferroptosis in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) and to explore its role in immune cell infiltration and systemic therapy. The gene expression profiles of ChRCC patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to identify differentially expressed prognostic ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) by univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses. Ferroptosis molecular subtypes were obtained by consensus clustering analysis. The FRG-based signature in the training set was established by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis and verified in the testing set. The association between molecular subtypes and the prognostic signature and immune microenvironment was explored to predict responses to immunotherapy. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify expression of the FRG-based signature externally. ChRCC patients were divided into two FRG subtypes. Two FRGs (TFRC and SLC7A11) were identified to construct the prognostic signature. The high-risk group and cluster 2 had worse overall survival than the low-risk group and cluster 1, respectively. The low-risk group and cluster 1 had higher levels of immune cell infiltration and expression of MHC and immune checkpoint molecules than the high-risk group and cluster 2. The risk score was a predictor of overall survival and had a good predictive ability, which was verified in the testing set and evaluated by ROC and calibration curves. The high-risk group had a higher tumor mutation burden. The different sensitivities of targeted drugs in patients with different risks were evaluated. External immunohistochemical analysis showed that TFRC and SLC7A11 were highly expressed in tumor tissues compared with para-cancer normal tissues, and the expression level was significantly associated with a more advanced stage and worse cancer-specific survival. An FRG signature was identified and validated to predict the clinicopathological features and prognosis of ChRCC. A significant association between the signature and immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and drug response is helpful to guide comprehensive treatment of ChRCC.",

It can lead to impaired joint mobility in the extremities and reduced quality of life. Chronic inflammation due to infiltration of various immune cells in an area of lymphedema is thought to lead to local fibrosis, but the molecular pathogenesis of lymphedema remains unclear. Development of effective therapies requires elucidation of the immunological mechanisms involved in the progression of lymphedema. The complement system is part of the innate immune system which has a central role in the elimination of invading microbes and acts as a scavenger of altered host cells, such as apoptotic and necrotic cells and cellular debris. Complement-targeted therapies have recently been clinically applied to various diseases caused by complement overactivation. In this context, we aimed to determine whether complement activation is involved in the development of lymphedema. Our mouse tail lymphedema models showed increased expression of C3, and that the classical or lectin pathway was locally activated. Complement activation was suggested to be involved in the progression of lymphedema. In comparison of the C3 knockout (KO) mouse lymphedema model and wild-type mice, there was no difference in the degree of edema at three weeks postoperatively, but the C3 KO mice had a significant increase of TUNEL+ necrotic cells and CD4+ T cells. Infiltration of macrophages and granulocytes was not significantly elevated in C3 KO or C5 KO mice compared with in wild-type mice. Impaired opsonization and decreased migration of macrophages and granulocytes due to C3 deficiency should therefore induce the accumulation of dead cells and may lead to increased infiltration of CD4+ T cells. Vigilance for exacerbation of lymphedema is necessary when surgical treatments have the potential to injure lymphatic vessels in patients undergoing complement-targeted therapies or with complement deficiency. Future studies should aim to elucidate the molecular mechanism of CD4+ T cell infiltration by accumulated dead cells.",

Therefore, SIG1R functions as an indirect regulator of Ca2+ and acts as an apoptosis modulator. Increased expression of SIG1R is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancers (BC), and SIG1R antagonists like BD1047 induce apoptosis. As a heavy metal, cadmium (Cd2+) is competitive with Ca2+ due to its physicochemical similarities and may trigger apoptosis at low concentrations. Our study investigated the SIG1R protein expression in 74 BC patients and found a significant increase in SIG1R expression in the triple-negative BC subtype. We also examined the apoptotic and anti-cancer effects of BD1047 in combination with CdCl2 in MCF7 and MDA-MB-213 cells. Cells were treated with CdCl2 at doses of 1 \u03bcM, 25 \u03bcM, and 50 \u03bcM, along with BD1047. Higher doses of CdCl2 were cytotoxic on both cancer cells and significantly increased DNA breaks. However, low-dose CdCl2 with BD1047 increased cell death and the apoptotic index in BC cells, although it did not exhibit cytotoxic effects on HUVEC cells. Co-administration of low-dose CdCl2 with BD1047 also reduced the migration and colony-forming ability of BC cells. Moreover, the expression of SIG1R protein in these groups decreased significantly compared to groups treated with BD1047 or low-dose CdCl2 alone. In conclusion, low-dose CdCl2 is thought to increase the apoptotic ability of BD1047 in BC cells by reducing SIG1R expression.",

        "AbstractText": "Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data may help us better understand the life of breast cancer patients. We have previously collected PRO data in a national Danish breast cancer study in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of the present post-hoc explorative study is to apply Machine Learning (ML) algorithms using permutation importance to explore how specific PRO symptoms influence nonadherence to six cycles of planned adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. We here investigate ePRO-data from the 347 patients. The ePRO presented 42 PROCTCAE questions on 25 symptoms. Patients completed the ePRO before each cycle of chemotherapy. Number of patients with completion of the scheduled six cycles of chemotherapy were registered. Two ML models were applied. One aimed at discovering the individual relative importance of the different questions in the dataset while the second aimed at discovering the relationships between the questions. Permutation importance was used. Out of 347 patients 238 patients remained in the final dataset, 15 patients dropped out. Two symptoms: aching joints and numbness/tingling, were the most important for dropout in the final dataset, each with an importance value of about 0.04. Model's average ROC-AUC-score being 0.706. In the second model a low performance score made the results very unreliable. In conclusion, this explorative data analysis using ML methodologies in an ePRO dataset from a population of women with breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy unravels that the symptoms aching joints and numbness/tingling could be important for drop out of planned adjuvant chemotherapy.",

However, the significance of postoperative hyperglycemia in non-DM cases has not been well investigated. We sought to establish whether postoperative hyperglycemia is associated with PICs and survival among patients with esophageal cancer, with a focus on non-DM cases. A total of 430 patients who underwent subtotal esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 2014 and 2018 were enrolled. Postoperative blood glucose was measured by arterial blood gas test every 8\u00a0h from postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD4. The association between hyperglycemia (mean\u2009\u2265\u2009200\u00a0mg/dl) and PICs or long-term outcomes on each POD was investigated. There were 53 DM and 377 non-DM cases.

        "AbstractText": "Both textbook outcome (TO) and hospital volume have been identified as quality metrics following cancer surgery. We sought to examine whether TO or hospital volume is more important relative to long-term survival following surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients who underwent surgery for HCC between 2004 and 2018 were identified using the National Cancer Database. TO was defined as R0 margin resection, no extended length of stay, no 30-day readmissions, and no 90-day mortality. The impact of TO and hospital case volume on long-term survival was determined using multivariable Cox regression. Among 24,895 patients who underwent HCC resection, 9.0% (n\u2009=\u20092,252), 79.5% (n\u2009=\u200919,787), and 11.5% (n\u2009=\u20092,856) of patients were operated on at low-, medium-, and high-volume hospitals, respectively. Treatment at high-volume hospitals and achievement of a post-operative TO were independently associated with improved 5-year overall survival (OS). Pairwise comparison demonstrated that patients treated at high-volume hospitals who did not achieve a TO still had a better 5-year OS versus individuals treated at low-volume hospitals who did achieve a TO (5-year OS, no TO vs. TO: low-volume hospitals, 26.5% vs. 48.6%; high volume hospitals: 62.6% vs. 74.9%, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Overall, resection of HCC at a high-volume hospital was independently associated with a 54% reduction in mortality. Long-term survival following HCC resection was largely associated with hospital case volume rather than TO. The effect of TO on long-term outcomes was largely mediated by hospital case volume highlighting the importance of centralization of care for patients with HCC.",

Patient-level data were linked to the United States Department of Agriculture data on food swamps and deserts. Multivariable regression was performed to examine the association between the food environment and outcomes. Among 53,426 patients, patients from the worse food environment were more likely to be Black, have a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and reside in areas with high social vulnerability.

        "AbstractText": "The available data on the role of perioperative systemic chemotherapy (SC) for diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM) patients undergoing (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is heterogeneous and unstandardized. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of SC on the survival outcomes of DMPM patients undergoing CRS-HIPEC and to identify prognostic factors that affect the decision to administer SC. Patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC in the National Cancer Institute Milan (1995-2020) were retrospectively analyzed using propensity score-matching of known covariates. The patients were grouped into three groups: group A (neoadjuvant chemotherapy [NACT] and no-SC), group B (no-SC and adjuvant chemotherapy [ACT]), and group C (NACT and ACT). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meir method, and prognostic factors were calculated using the Cox-regression method. After a median follow-up period of 45 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.348-83.652 months) for group A, 115 months (95% CI, 44.379-185.621 months) for group B, and 88 months (95% CI, 3.296-172.704 months) for group C, the study analyzed 154 DMPM patients consisting of matched group A (NACT: 60 + no-SC: 52 = 112), group B (ACT: 38 + no-SC: 38 = 76), and group C (NACT: 31 + ACT: 31 = 62). The patients undergoing ACT had better 5-year OS and PFS than the patients undergoing NACT. In the multivariate analysis, ACT was significantly associated with improved OS by 48% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.280-0.965, p = 0.038). For PFS, the association of ACT did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.531; 95% CI, 0.266-1.058; p = 0.072). The optimum treatment sequence for DMPM is CRS-HIPEC followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk patients. Upfront surgery appears preferable to NACT for patients amenable to complete CRS.",

The aims of this evidence-based consensus were to define the indications for HIPEC, to select the preferred HIPEC regimens, and to define research priorities regarding the use of HIPEC for PM-CRC. The consensus steering committee elaborated and formulated pertinent clinical questions according to the PICO (patient, intervention, comparator, outcome) method and assessed the evidence according to the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Standardized evidence tables were presented to an international expert panel to reach a consensus (4-point, weak and strong positive/negative) on HIPEC regimens and research priorities through a two-round Delphi process. The consensus was defined as \u2265\u00a050% agreement for the 4-point consensus grading or \u2265\u00a070% for either of the two combinations. Evidence was weak or very weak for 9/10 clinical questions. In total, 70/90 eligible panelists replied to both Delphi rounds (78%), with a consensus for 10/10 questions on HIPEC regimens. There was strong negative consensus concerning the short duration, high-dose oxaliplatin (OX) protocol (55.7%), and a weak positive vote (53.8-64.3%) in favor of mitomycin-C (MMC)-based HIPEC (preferred choice: Dutch protocol: 35\u00a0mg/m2, 90\u00a0min, three fractions), both for primary cytoreduction and recurrence. Determining the role of HIPEC after CRS was considered the most important research question, regarded as essential by 85.7% of the panelists. Furthermore, over 90% of experts suggest performing HIPEC after primary and secondary CRS for recurrence >\u00a01 year after the index surgery. Based on the available evidence, despite the negative results of PRODIGE 7, HIPEC could be conditionally recommended to patients with PM-CRC after CRS. While more preclinical and clinical data are eagerly awaited to harmonize the procedure further, the MMC-based Dutch protocol remains the preferred regimen after primary and secondary CRS.",

        "AbstractText": "AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 are important members of aldo-keto reductase family which plays a significant role in cancer progression by modulating cellular metabolism. These enzymes are involved in various metabolic processes, including the synthesis and metabolism of hormones, detoxification of reactive aldehydes, and the reduction of various endogenous and exogenous compounds. This study aimed to explore the potential of strychnine as an anticancer agent by targeting AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 via drug repurposing approach. To assess the drug-like properties of strychnine, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PKPB) model and High Throughput Pharmacokinetics (HTPK) approach were employed. The obtained results fell within the expected range for drug molecules, confirming its suitability for further investigation. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) studies were conducted to gain insight into the electronic properties contributing to the drug molecule's reactivity. Building upon the promising DFT results, molecular docking analysis using the AutoDock tool was performed to examine the binding interactions between strychnine and the proposed targets, AKR1B1 and AKR1B10. Findings from the molecular docking studies suggested a higher probability of strychnine acting as an inhibitor of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 with docking scores of -\u200930.84 and -\u200929.36\u00a0kJ/mol respectively. To validate the stability of the protein-ligand complex, Molecular Dynamic Simulation (MDS) studies were conducted, revealing the formation of a stable complex between the enzymes and strychnine. This comprehensive approach sheds light on the potential effectiveness of strychnine as a treatment for breast, lung, liver, and pancreatic cancers, as well as related malignancies. The novel insights gained from the physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, density functional theory, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations collectively support the prospect of strychnine as a promising molecule for anticancer therapy. Further investigations are warranted to validate these findings and explore the therapeutic potential of strychnine in preclinical and clinical settings.",

This study examines the breast cancer-related knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors of Zuni women in the Southwest United States (U.S.). In 2020 and 2021, a survey was administered to better understand cancer screening patterns in Zuni Pueblo; 110 women from 50 to 75 years of age were recruited to respond to the breast cancer screening portion. Inclusion criteria included self-identifying as AI, a member of the Zuni tribe, or married to a Zuni tribal member, and meeting the age and gender requirements. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were conducted examining the associations between measures of breast cancer knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors and breast cancer screening status (never, ever/non-compliant, and ever/compliant). Of survey participants, 47.3% have had a breast cancer screening and are up-to-date, 39.1% have had a screening in the past but are not up-to-date, and 13.6% have never been screened. Age was the only statistically significant socioeconomic predictor of breast cancer screening; the median (interquartile range) ages of each group are 62 (54, 68) ever/compliant, 56 (54, 68) ever/non-compliant, and 53 (51, 55) never (p-value\u2009<\u20090.001). Significant differences by health status and access to medical care include having a regular health care provider and going to see a provider for routine check-ups. The survey also shows differences in knowledge about breast cancer risk factors, beliefs, and behaviors. Women across all three screening statuses reported that they would get screened if encouraged by a health care provider. While survey respondents report a relatively high rate of ever having had a breast cancer screening, less than half are compliant with screening guidelines, which shows there is an opportunity to improve breast cancer screening rates. With culturally tailored interventions, providers have the potential to improve breast cancer screening for Zuni women.",

The sleep factors examined were quality, latency, duration, disturbance, and sleep medication use, based on a shortened version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, as well as chronotype (preference for morning or evening activity). This analysis was limited to women who were post-menopausal at the time they answered these sleep-related questions. Measures of sleep quality did not appear to be associated with subsequent breast cancer risk. The HR for evening chronotypes compared to morning chronotypes was somewhat elevated (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04, 1.36).

The electronic databases included English publications in Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Scopus. A total of 4962 patients with appendicitis enrolled in 4 comparative studies were included. The mean age was 43.55\u00a0years (16- 94), and half were male (51%). Based on intra-operative findings, 1394 (38%) had complicated appendicitis, and 3558 (62%) had uncomplicated appendicitis. The overall incidence rate of neoplasm was 1.98%.

However, the corresponding mechanisms remain unclear. High-throughput sequencing analysis of H3122 human ALK-positive NSCLC cells treated with ALK inhibitor/ dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was performed to identify coagulation-associated differential genes between EML4-ALK fusion protein inhibited cells and control cells. Sequentially, we confirmed its expression in NSCLC patients' tissues and in the plasma of a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. An inferior vena cava (IVC) ligation model was used to assess clot formation potential. Additionally, pathways involved in tissue factor (TF) regulation were explored in ALK-positive cell lines H3122 and H2228. Statistical significance was determined by Student t-test and one-way ANOVA using SPSS. Sequencing analysis identified a significant downregulation of TF after inhibiting EML4-ALK fusion protein activity in H3122 cells. In clinical NSCLC cases, TF expression was increased especially in ALK-positive NSCLC tissues. Meanwhile, H3122 and H2228 with high TF expression exhibited shorter plasma clotting time and higher TF activity versus ALK-negative H1299 and A549\u00a0in cell culture supernatant. Mice bearing H2228 tumor showed a higher concentration of tumor-derived TF and TF activity in plasma and the highest adjusted IVC clot weights. Limiting EML4-ALK protein phosphorylation downregulated extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2)-activating the protein-1(AP-1) signaling pathway and thus attenuated TF expression. EML4-ALK fusion protein may enhance venous thrombogenicity by regulating coagulation factor TF expression. There was potential involvement of the pERK1/2-AP-1 pathway in this process.",

Additionally, we evaluated some of their morphological and molecular mimickers, including glomangiomas, Ewing sarcomas (ES), myxoid liposarcomas, and MDM2/CDK4-amplified sarcomas (well-differentiated liposarcoma/WDLPS, dedifferentiated liposarcoma/DDLPS, and intimal sarcoma). All successfully tested GLI1-altered tumors (11/11) demonstrated at least moderate/strong nuclear and/or cytoplasmic GLI1 IHC positivity. GLI1-amplified tumors exhibited a moderate/strong predominantly nuclear staining, compared to a moderate, patchy, and predominantly cytoplasmic GLI1 positivity in GLI1-fusion tumors. Among their mimics, GLI1 immunoreactivity, either cytoplasmic or nuclear, was observed in intimal sarcoma (3/3) and WDLPS/DDLPS (22/25). GLI1 IHC demonstrated 92% sensitivity and 90.8% specificity in diagnosing GLI1-altered neoplasms. Strong/moderate nuclear/cytoplasmic p16 immunoexpression was noted in all GLI1-amplified tumors compared to none of fused cases. Overall, the GLI1/p16 combination demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 93% for GLI1-amplified tumors. In conclusion, we confirm that GLI1 IHC represents a good, quick, and cheap helpful screening tool. The inclusion of p16 may aid in pre-screening for potential GLI1-amplified neoplasms and provide insights on which tumors warrant further molecular testing.",

        "AbstractText": "Osteoporosis (OP), a systemic and chronic bone disease, is distinguished by low bone mass and destruction of bone microarchitecture. Ginsenoside Compound-K (CK), one of the metabolites of ginsenoside Rb1, has anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and hypolipidemic activities. We have demonstrated CK could promote osteogenesis and fracture healing in our previous study. However, the contribution of CK to osteoporosis has not been examined. In the present study, we investigated the effect of CK on osteoclastogenesis and ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis. The results showed that CK inhibited receptor activator for nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclast differentiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity by inhibiting the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 and oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, we also demonstrated that CK could inhibit bone resorption using bone marrow-derived macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CK attenuated bone loss by suppressing the activity of osteoclast and alleviating oxidative stress in vivo. Taken together, these results showed CK could inhibit osteoclastogenesis and prevent OVX-induced bone loss by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

        "AbstractText": "The presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is majorly responsible for the development and recurrence of cancer. Earlier reports suggested that upon DNA damage, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) helps in chromatin modulation and DNA repair process, thereby promoting CSC survival. But whether a combination of DNA damaging agents along with PARP inhibitors can modulate chromatin assembly, inhibit DNA repair processes, and subsequently target CSCs is not known. Hence, we have investigated the effect of nontoxic bioactive compound quinacrine (QC) and a potent PARP inhibitor Talazoparib in patient-derived oral mucosa CSCs (OM-CSCs) and in vivo xenograft mice preclinical model systems. Data showed that QC\u2009+\u2009Talazoparib inhibited the PARP-1-mediated chromatin remodelers' recruitment and deregulated HAT activity of GCN5 (general control nonderepressible-5) and P300 at DNA damage site, thereby preventing the access of repair proteins to the damaged DNA. Additionally, this combination treatment inhibited topoisomerase activity, induced topological stress, and induced apoptosis in OM-CSCs. Similar results were observed in an in vivo xenograft mice model system. Collectively, the data suggested that QC\u2009+\u2009Talazoparib treatment inhibited BER pathway, induced genomic instability and triggered apoptosis in OM-CSCs through the deregulation of PARP-1-mediated chromatin remodelers (GCN5 and P300) activity. Schematic representation of QC\u2009+\u2009Talazoparib-induced apoptosis in oral mucosa CSCs. (1) Induction of DNA damage takes place after QC treatment (2) PARP1-mediated PARylation at the site of DNA damage, which recruits multiple chromatin remodelers (3) Acetylation at the histone tails relax the structure of chromatin and recruits the BER pathway proteins at the site of DNA damage. (4) BER pathway activated at the site of DNA damage. (5) CSCs survive after successful repair of DNA damage. (6) Treatment of QC-treated CSCs with PARP inhibitor Talazoparib (7) Inhibition of PARylation results in failure of chromatin remodelers to interact with PARP1. (8) Inhibition of acetylation status leads to chromatin compaction. (9) BER pathway proteins are not recruited at the site of DNA damage, resulting in inhibition of BER pathway and accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, leading to apoptosis and cell death.",

        "AbstractText": "Renal cell carcinoma is an immunogenic tumour with a prominent dysfunctional immune cell infiltrate, unable to control tumour growth. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy have improved the outlook for some patients, many individuals are non-responders or relapse despite treatment. The hostile metabolic environment in RCC affects the ability of T-cells to maintain their own metabolic programme constraining T-cell immunity in RCC. We investigated the phenotype, function and metabolic capability of RCC TILs correlating this with clinicopathological features of the tumour and metabolic environment at the different disease stages. Flow cytometric analysis of freshly isolated TILs showed the emergence of exhausted T-cells in advanced disease based on their PD-1high and CD39 expression and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines upon in vitro stimulation. Exhausted T-cells from advanced stage disease also displayed an overall phenotype of metabolic insufficiency, characterized by mitochondrial alterations and defects in glucose uptake. Nanostring nCounter cancer metabolism assay on RNA obtained from 30 ccRCC cases revealed significant over-expression of metabolic genes even at early stage disease (pT1-2), while at pT3-4 and the locally advanced thrombi stages, there was an overall decrease in differentially expressed metabolic genes. Notably, the gene PPARGC1A was the most significantly down-regulated gene from pT1-2 to pT3-4 RCC which correlated with loss of mitochondrial function in tumour-infiltrating T-cells evident at this tumour stage. Down-regulation of PPARGC1A into stage pT3-4 may be the 'tipping-point' in RCC disease progression, modulating immune activity in ccRCC and potentially reducing the efficacy of immunotherapies in RCC and poorer patient outcomes.",

The development of a molecular predictor of early recurrence would allow for the identification of ovarian cancer (OC) patients with high risk of relapse. The Ovarian Cancer Disease Free Survival Predictor (ODFSP), a predictive model constructed from a special set of 1580 OC tumors in which gene expression was assessed using both microarray and sequencing platforms, was created by our team. To construct gene expression barcodes that were resistant to biases caused by disparate profiling platforms and batch effects, we employed a meta-analysis methodology that was based on the binary gene pair technique. We demonstrate that ODFSP is a reliable single-sample predictor of early recurrence (1 year or less) using the largest pool of OC transcriptome data sets available to date. The ODFSP model showed significantly high prognostic value for binary recurrence prediction unaffected by clinicopathologic factors, with a meta-estimate of the area under the receiver operating curve of 0.64 (P\u2009 = \u20094.6E-05) and a D-index (robust hazard ratio) of 1.67 (P\u2009 = \u20099.2E-06), respectively.

Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis of ODFSP's signature genes identified prominent pathways that included cAMP signaling pathway and FoxO signaling pathway. By identifying individuals who might benefit from a more aggressive treatment plan or enrolment in a clinical trial but who will not benefit from standard surgery or chemotherapy, ODFSP could help with treatment decisions.",

[18F]-AZC was synthesized via a one-step substitution reaction and characterized by radiochemistry methods. [18F]-AZC specificity and affinity toward c-Met were assessed by cell uptake assay, with or without cold compound [19F]-AZC or commercial c-Met inhibitor blocking. MicroPET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in subcutaneous murine xenografts of glioma. Additionally, [18F]-AZC was then further evaluated in orthotopic glioma xenografts, by microPET/CT imaging accompanied with MRI and autoradiography for co-registration of the tumor. Immunofluorescence staining was also carried out to qualitatively evaluate the c-Met expression in tumor tissue, co-localizes with H&E staining. This probe shows easy radiosynthesis, high stability in vitro and in vivo, high targeting affinity, and favorable lipophilicity and brain transport coefficient. [18F]-AZC demonstrates excellent tumor imaging properties in vivo and can delineate c-Met positive glioma specifically at 1 h after intravenous injection of the probe. Moreover, favorable correlation was observed between the [18F]-AZC accumulation and the amount of c-Met expression in tumor. This novel imaging probe could be applied as a valuable tool for management of anti-c-Met therapies in patients in the future.",

Unlike in natural infection, vaccination with MPER/liposomes lacks a necessary structure-based constraint to select for antibodies with an adequate approach angle. Consequently, the resulting Abs cannot physically access the MPER crawlspace on the virion surface. By studying naturally arising Abs, we further reveal that flexibility of the human IgG3 hinge mitigates the epitope inaccessibility and additionally facilitates Env spike protein crosslinking.

        "AbstractText": "Type-I photosensitizers have shown advantages in addressing the shortcomings of traditional oxygen-dependent type-II photosensitizers for the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of hypoxic tumors. However, developing type-I photosensitizers is yet a huge challenge because the type-II energy transfer process is much faster than the type-I electron transfer process. Herein, from the fundamental point of view, an effective approach is proposed to improve the electron transfer efficiency of the photosensitizer by lowering the internal reorganization energy and exciton binding energy via self-assembly-induced exciton delocalization. An example proof is presented by the design of a perylene diimide (PDI)-based photosensitizer (PDIMp) that can generate singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) via a type-II energy transfer process in the monomeric state, but induce the generation of superoxide anion (O2 \u02d9-) via a type-I electron transfer process in the aggregated state. Significantly, with the addition ofcucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]), the self-assembled PDIMp can convert back to the monomeric state via host-guest complexation and consequently recover the generation of 1 O2 . The biological evaluations reveal that supramolecular nanoparticles (PDIMp-NPs) derived from PDIMp show superior phototherapeutic performance via synergistic type-I PDT and mild photothermal therapy (PTT) against cancer under either normoxia or hypoxia conditions.",

        "AbstractText": "Motivational interviewing is a client-centered counseling technique widely applied as a behavior change strategy. It has been adopted to help cancer patients modify health behaviors. The effectiveness of motivational interviewing on physical activity behavior and its associated outcomes in cancer patients is unclear. The aim of this review was to determine the effect of motivational interviewing with other motivational strategies on physical activity behavior and associated outcomes in cancer patients. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, following PRISMA guidelines. Eight English databases were searched from inception to October 2022. The outcomes were evaluated using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with fixed- and random-effects models. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed by Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Eight trials with 450 participants were identified, with sample sizes ranging from 25 to 87. The number of motivational interviewing sessions ranged from one to 12. The types of motivational strategy intervention varied. Apart from motivational interviewing, pedometers were frequently used as a strategy. The quality of the included studies differed, with one out of eight scoring low in the overall risk of bias. Our meta-analysis indicated that motivational interviewing with other motivational strategies significantly promoted the total physical activity level (SMD\u2009=\u20090.34, 95% confidence interval [0.10, 0.58], p\u2009=\u2009.005; low certainty), but not did not affect other physical and psychosocial outcomes. The combination of motivational interviewing with other motivational strategies was beneficial in increasing the total physical activity level of cancer patients. Motivational interviewing can be a clinical communication skill that healthcare professionals, especially nurses, can acquire to motivate patients to change their behaviors to promote health. Future studies adopting motivational interviewing interventions could consider additional motivational strategies, such as pedometers, to maximize the benefits on physical activity behaviors.",

        "AbstractText": "Molecular diffusion and leakage impede the long-term retention of probes/drugs and may cause potential adverse effects in theranostic fields. Spatiotemporally manipulating the organelle-immobilization behavior of probes/drugs for prolonged tumor retention is indispensable to achieving effective cancer diagnosis and therapy. Herein, we propose a rational strategy that could realize near-infrared light-activated ribonucleic acids (RNAs) cross-linking for prolonged tumor retention and simultaneously endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) monitoring in colorectal tumors. Profiting from efficient singlet oxygen (1O2) generation from Cy796 under 808 nm light irradiation, the 1O2-animated furan moiety in Cy796 could covalently cross-link with cytoplasmic RNAs via a cycloaddition reaction and realize organelle immobilization. Subsequently, specific thiolysis of Cy796 assisted with H2S resulted in homologous product Cy644 with reduced 1O2 generation yields and enhanced absolute fluorescence quantum yields (from 7.42 to 27.70%) with blue-shifted absorption and emission, which avoided the molecular oxidation fluorescence quenching effect mediated by 1O2 and validated fluorescence imaging. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that our proposed strategy possessed adequate capacity for fluorescence imaging and endogenous H2S detection in HCT116 cells, particularly accumulated at the tumor sites, and retained long-term imaging with excellent biocompatibility. The turn-on fluorescence mode and turn-off 1O2 generation efficiency in our strategy successfully realized a diminished fluorescence cross-talk and oxidation quenching effect. It is adequately envisioned that our proposed strategy for monitoring biomarkers and prolonged tumor retention will contribute tremendous dedication in the clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic fields.",

To our knowledge, no studies were reported regarding sinus arrest on day 4 after paraganglioma resection. A 66-year-old female patient with a history of pulmonary vein isolation visited our department for sigmoid colon cancer treatment. Enhanced computed tomography revealed an enhanced small nodule-like lymph node near the root of the inferior mesenteric artery. The patient underwent laparoscopic colectomy with regional lymph node dissection. Postoperatively, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation attacks developed, and the patient resumed oral medication. Additionally, sinus arrest after tachycardia developed. Changing the oral medication could maintain her circulatory dynamics. Pathological examination revealed that differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma infiltrated the submucosa. Immunohistochemically, the excised nodule as a lymph node was considered a functional paraganglioma. Our case indicates that paraganglioma resection and oral medication resumption may contribute to sinus arrest.

Mice were xenografted with the human lung adenocarcinoma line A549 or large cell lung cancer line FT821. Tumour uptake of 18F-FLT and 18F-FDG was imaged using PET/CT before and 1 week after irradiation. In A549 tumours, 18F-FLT uptake was significantly decreased, and 18F-FDG uptake was unchanged post-irradiation compared with pre-irradiation. In FT821 tumours, uptake of both 18F-FLT and 18F-FDG uptake was substantially decreased post-irradiation compared with pre-irradiation. In both xenografts, tumour volumes in the irradiated groups were significantly decreased compared with those in the control group. 18F-FLT is expected to contribute to individual NSCLC therapy because it accurately evaluates the decrease in tumour activity that cannot be captured by 18F-FDG. 18F-FDG may be useful for evaluating surviving cells without being affected by the inflammatory reaction at an extremely early stage, approximately 1 week after irradiation. Combined use of 18F-FLT and 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging may increase the accurate prediction of radiotherapy efficacy, which may lead to improved patient outcomes and minimally invasive personalised therapy.

The incidence of pancreatic cancer has risen dramatically over recent decades. Early diagnosis of this malignancy is generally difficult because the symptoms do not become apparent until the disease has progressed, generally leading to a poor outcome. To achieve earlier diagnosis, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of pancreatic cancer patients showing deterioration of plasma glucose levels while hospitalized. Thirty-six cases were divided into 2 groups;those diagnosed with diabetes more than a year prior to identification of pancreatic cancer and diabetes secondary to pancreatic cancer. These 2 groups were further subdivided according to the tumor site (head or body/tail), allowing analysis of 4 subgroups. Anthropometric measurements, laboratory values were determined. Both groups with diabetes lost at least 4 kg and showed HbA1c deterioration of at least 1% within 5 months of the pancreatic cancer diagnosis. The post-meal elevation of serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) was significantly decreased in the group with cancer of the pancreatic head, and this was unrelated to tumor size.

There were 19 patients in this prospective study, all randomly assigned to either a parenteral nutrition (PN) group or an EAN group for the first seven days after surgery. The EAN group received 1.8-fold greater arginine (10.1 g/day) compared with the PN group, which was administered through an enteral tube inserted into the jejunal loop. Both groups were provided almost identical amounts of total amino acids (54 g/day), and the total energy was set at 65% of the total requirement (25 kcal/kg/day). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, oral intake, nutritional status, or body weight. The serum arginine profile was similar in the two groups, as it decreased significantly on postoperative day (POD) 1, and gradually returned to preoperative levels by POD 7. The nitrogen balance remained negative until POD 7 in the PN group, but turned neutral at POD 7 in the EAN group. While we could not confirm body weight loss improvement, these results suggested that early arginine-rich enteral nutrition could improve the nitrogen balance after total gastrectomy. J. Med.

A thorough knowledge of the disease's natural history is required to promptly stratify patients' risks, since MASLD is a multifaceted disorder with a broad range of clinical phenotypes. The histological disease spectrum ranges from isolated hepatic steatosis, currently named as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver (MASL), to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and eventually may accumulate hepatic fibrosis and develop cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several risk factors for fibrosis progression have been identified, while the disease's progression displays notable dynamism and bidirectionality. When compared to the general population, all MASLD histological stages are substantially related with greater overall mortality, and this association exhibits a disease severity-dependent pattern. Interestingly, the fibrosis stage is the most accurate predictor of mortality among MASLD patients. The mortality attributed to MASLD predominantly stems from issues linked with the liver and cardiovascular system, as well as\u00a0HCC and extrahepatic cancers. In light of the disease natural course, it is crucial to prioritize the identification of at-risk patients for disease progression in order to effectively address and change modifiable risk factors, hence mitigating disease complications. Further investigation is required to define the phenotype of rapid progressors more precisely as well as to improve risk stratification for HCC in non-cirrhotic individuals.",

The current analysis aimed to understand whether there are potential factors affecting the relationship between selenium and prostate cancer. To clarify the relationship between dietary selenium intake and prostate cancer, we evaluated the correlation between dietary selenium intake and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. After screening the NHANES survey data from 2005 to 2010, data for 3,614 of 31,034 participants were considered suitable to include in our study. Dietary selenium intake was the independent variable of our study, while PSA was the dependent variable. We stratified participants into current, former, and never smokers and performed an interaction test on the relationship between selenium intake and PSA using multivariable logistic regression for each smoking-status subgroup. For our subgroup analysis, we grouped participants based on smoking status and investigated the association between dietary selenium intake and PSA levels. Among the 242 participants with a PSA level of 4 or higher, the mean age was 58.5 years (\u00b112.1). After adjusting for covariates, we did not find a significant association between dietary selenium and the odds of having a high PSA level. However, we observed a significant interaction between smoking status and dietary selenium in relation to PSA levels (P\u202f=\u202f.007). Specifically, smokers had lower odds of having high PSA levels, while nonsmokers had higher odds. This suggests that smoking status may modify the effect of dietary selenium on PSA levels. Our findings suggest that smoking status affects the relationship between dietary selenium intake and PSA and that smokers are at lower odds of having a high PSA level.",

Isolated adrenalectomies performed within our health system were identified (2016-2021). High-volume surgeons were defined as those performing \u22656 cases/year. Outcomes included indication for surgery, perioperative outcomes, and costs. Of 476 adrenalectomies, high-volume surgeons (n\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b3) performed 394, while low-volume surgeons (n\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b12) performed 82. High-volume surgeons more frequently operated for pheochromocytoma (19% vs. 16%, p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001) and less frequently for metastasis (6.4% vs. 23%, p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001), more frequently used laparoscopy (95% vs. 80%, p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001), and had lower operative supply costs ($1387 vs. $1,636, p\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.037). Additionally, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was associated with shorter length of stay (-3.43 days, p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001), lower hospitalization costs (-$72,417, p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001), and increased likelihood of discharge to home (OR 17.03, p\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.008). High-volume surgeons more often resect primary adrenal pathology and utilize laparoscopy. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is, in turn, associated with decreased healthcare resource utilization.",

The prescribed dose was 66 Gy relative-biological-effectiveness (RBE) in 10 fractions at the isocenter and 50% volume of the ICTVs for the PS and PBS, respectively. We compared the target and OAR dose statistics from the dose volume histograms. The PBS+ group had a significantly better mean PTV conformity index than the PBS- and PS groups. The mean dose sparing for PBS+ was better than those for PBS- and PS. Only the normal lung doses of PBS- were worse than those of PS. The overall performance of the OAR sparing was in the order of PBS+, PBS-, and PS. The PBS+ plan showed significantly better target homogeneity and OAR sparing than the PBS- and PS plans. PBS requires collimating systems to treat lung cancers with the most OAR sparing while maintaining the target coverage.",

Tumor deposits have been reported as a negative prognostic factor. However, the survival significance of categorized tumor deposits is uncertain, particularly in gastric cancer. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic difference among categorized tumor deposits. Patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer were enrolled. All tumor deposits were categorized into irregular nodule, irregular nodule star, smooth nodule, and vascular/neural invasion. There are some cases with more than 2 categorized tumor deposits. These cases were categorized as tumor deposit complex in the following analysis. We performed survival analysis between the patients with and without tumor deposits, and compared the survival among each categorized tumor deposit. Of 868 patients, there were 96 (11.1%) and 772 (88.9%) patients with and without tumor deposits. Vascular/neural invasion, smooth nodule, irregular nodule, irregular nodule star, and the tumor deposits complex was observed in 6 (6.3%), 15 (15.6%), 43 (44.8%), 1 (1.0%), and 31 (32.3%) patients. Patients with tumor deposits displayed poorer survival than those without; the 3-year overall survival: tumor deposits negative\u00a0= 87.0%, tumor deposits positive\u00a0= 53.2% (P < .001).

        "AbstractText": "We aimed to evaluate the predictive significance of forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) expression levels among individuals with clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) and establish a radiomics model for predicting FOXP3 expression. 430 patients with ccRCC were included in the gene-based prognostic analyses; 100 samples were used for radiomics feature generation, model development, and evaluation. A gradient boosting machine was employed to model the selected radiomics features. The developed model generated radiomics scores (RS) that predicted FOXP3 expression. The FOXP3 prognostic model combining imaging features was applied for survival and clinical indicator correlation analyses. FOXP3 was highly expressed in patients with ccRCC and served as an independent predictive marker (hazard ratio [HR]=2.357, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.582-3.511, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The radiomics model formed by three radiomics characteristics was identified as a strong prognostic indicator of overall survival (OS). The predictive power of the model was commendable (areas under the curve: 0.835 and 0.809 for training and validation sets, respectively). Significant between-group variations in RS distribution were identified, as indicated by gene expression levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Disparities were observed in pathological stage, pharmaceutical therapy, and neoplasm status between low and high RS cohorts (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a significant correlation between increased RS and decreased OS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), which was also observed in the multivariate analyses (HR=3.411, 95% CI: 1.039-11.196, p\u00a0=\u00a00.043). Prognostic outcome of ccRCC is closely linked to FOXP3 expression level. Computed tomography-based radiomics shows promise for prognostic prediction in ccRCC.",

Fumarate hydratase (FH) has been identified as a control point. Notably, FH loss in different models and cell types has been found to lead to DNA and RNA release from mitochondria which are sensed by cytosolic nucleic acid sensors including retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I, melanoma differentiation-associated protein (MDA)5, and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) to upregulate IFN-\u03b2 production.

We performed a literature search in the main databases until July 31st, 2023. We included all human based studies on GWAS for lung cancer which presented results for SCLC. Only studies with participants diagnosed of SCLC with anatomopathological confirmation were included. Fourteen studies were identified; 8 studies showed a relationship between ASCL1 overexpression and SCLC, which may regulate CHRNA5/A3/B4 cluster, producing a consequent nAChR overexpression. Nine papers, including 8 of the previous, found a positive association between SNPs located in chromosome 15 and SCLC. The most important cluster of genes found is CHRNA5/A3/B4 but the mechanism for the role of these genes is unclear.

Women are exposed to unique risk factors that remain largely understudied such as indoor pollution, second-hand tobacco exposure, biological differences, gender differences in tolerability and response to therapy in lung cancer, and societal gender roles, that create distinct survivorship needs. Women continue to lack representation in lung cancer clinical trials and are typically treated with data generated from majority male patient study populations, which may be inappropriate to extrapolate and generalize to females. Current lung cancer treatment and screening guidelines do not incorporate sex-specific differences and physicians also often do not account for gender differences when choosing treatments or discussing survivorship needs. To best provide targeted treatment approaches, greater representation of women in lung cancer clinical trials and further research is necessary.

Each of three base characterising e-cigarette flavour solutions ('bold tobacco', 'mango,' 'wintergreen') in both 2% and 4% concentrations of nicotine benzoate salt were manipulated by adding either: (1) Menthol (0.5%), (2) WS-23 (0.75%) or (3) No cooling agent. After each administration, participants rated 3 appeal and 5 sensory attributes (0-100 scales). Participants (n=84; M(SD)=38.6 (13.6) years old) were either exclusive e-cigarette (25.0%), cigarette (36.9%) or dual (38.1%) users.

The primary objective was to summarize outcome values and corresponding terminology from studies on laser lithotripsy performance using stone volume in relation to time or energy. The secondary objective was to propose a standardized terminology for reporting laser performance metrics. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the search string (\"j*/mm3\" OR \"mm3/j*\" OR \"mm3/s*\" OR \"s*/mm3\" OR \"mm3/min*\" OR \"min*/mm3\" AND \"lithotripsy\") on Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed databases. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two authors. A total of 28 studies were included, covering holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG), MOSES, and thulium fiber laser (TFL) technologies. Laser energy consumption values reported for the studies ranged from 2.0 - 43.5\u00a0J/mm3in vitro and from 2.7 - 47.8\u00a0J/mm3in vivo, translating to laser ablation efficiency of 0.023 - 0.500\u00a0mm3/J and 0.021 - 0.370\u00a0mm3/J, respectively. Laser ablation speeds ranged from 0.3 - 8.5\u00a0mm3/s in vivo, translating to lasing time consumption of 0.12 - 3.33\u00a0s/mm3. Laser efficacy ranged from 4.35 - 51.7\u00a0mm3/min in vivo. There was high heterogeneity for the terminology used to describe laser performance for the same metrics. The range of laser performance metric values relating stone volume to energy or time is wide, with corresponding differing terminology. We propose a standardized terminology for future studies on laser lithotripsy, including laser ablation efficiency (mm3/J), laser ablation speed (mm3/s), and laser energy consumption (J/mm3). Laser efficacy (mm3/min) is proposed as a broader term that is based on the total operative time, encompassing the whole technique using the laser.

However, for uro-oncological patients, evidence up to 2020 did not demonstrate significant benefits in terms of postoperative complications or hospital length of stay (LOS). We reviewed the literature from 2020 to 2023 and screened 205 reports, of which four full texts were included. Two retrospective cohort studies, despite having potential confounding risks, indicated that preoperative exercise might reduce LOS. One of these studies also suggested a lower likelihood of complications. Present evidence hints at the potential benefits of embedding exercise in prehabilitation for uro-oncological patients, particularly for short-term functional results. However, evidence on a direct effect on postoperative complications and LOS is still inconclusive. Future research should prioritise identification of specific exercises (eg, anaerobic vs aerobic, strength training, endurance, or respiratory exercises) that yield the most cost-effective benefits.

However, CEA values are unique to and significantly differ between individual assays with various optimal cutoffs reported in the literature for NMC. Here, we investigate the optimal CEA cut-off value of pancreatic cysts from two different assays to identify differences in thresholds. Pancreatic cyst fluid CEA levels, CEA assay platform (Beckman Dxl (BD) or Siemens Centaur XP (SC)), and clinical/pathological information were retrospectively collected. Cases were categorised into either NMC or non-NMC. Optimal CEA cut-off values were calculated via a receiver operator characteristic curve. Cut-off values were then identified separately by assay platform. In total, 149 pancreatic cystic lesions with concurrent CEA values (SC: n=47; BD: n=102) were included.

We assessed reflex testing of c-Met immunohistochemistry (IHC) at diagnosis for NSCLC in the real-world. We retrospectively collected clinical, pathological and molecular data of cases diagnosed with NSCLC in our institution from January 2021 to June 2023. We performed c-Met IHC (SP44 clone) and scored the expression using a H-score and a three-tier classification. 391 cases with interpretable c-Met IHC staining were included. The median age at diagnosis was 70 years (range 25-89 years) including 234 males (male/female ratio 1:5). 58% of the samples came from surgical resections, 35% from biopsies and 8% from cytological procedures. 52% of cases were classified as c-Met-positive (H-score\u2265150) and 19% were classified as c-Methigh (\u226550%, 3+). 43% of the c-Metneg presented with lymph node and/or visceral metastases at diagnosis vs 55% for c-Methigh (p=0.042). 23% of the adenocarcinomas showed c-Methigh expression vs 3% for squamous cell carcinomas (p=0.004). 27% of the c-Metneg cases had a high PD-L1 expression vs 58% of c-Methigh cases (p<0.001). MET ex14 skipping was present in 8% of the c-Methigh cases. Systematic c-Met testing in daily routine for NSCLC patients is feasible, highlighting a potential correlation with clinicopathological and molecular features.",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, developing the idea of \"cancer big data\" has emerged as a result of the significant expansion of various fields such as clinical research, genomics, proteomics and public health records. Advances in omics technologies are making a significant contribution to cancer big data in biomedicine and disease diagnosis. The increasingly availability of extensive cancer big data has set the stage for the development of multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks. These frameworks aim to analyze high-dimensional multi-omics data, extracting meaningful information that is challenging to obtain manually. Although interpretability and data quality remain critical challenges, these methods hold great promise for advancing our understanding of cancer biology and improving patient care and clinical outcomes. Here, we provide an overview of cancer big data and explore the applications of both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches in cancer genomic and proteomic studies. We briefly discuss the challenges and potential of AI techniques in the integrated analysis of omics data, as well as the future direction of personalized treatment options in cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "BRD7 was identified as a tumor suppressor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) are involved in the occurrence and development of NPC as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. However, the function and mechanism of the circular RNA forms derived from BRD7 in NPC are not well understood. In this study, we first identified that circBRD7 was a novel circRNA derived from BRD7 that inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion of NPC cells, as well as the xenograft tumor growth and metastasis in\u00a0vivo. Mechanistically, circBRD7 promoted the transcriptional activation and expression of BRD7 by enhancing the enrichment of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in the promoter region of its host gene BRD7, and BRD7 promoted the formation of circBRD7. Therefore, circBRD7 formed a positive feedback loop with BRD7 to inhibit NPC development and progression. Moreover, restoration of BRD7 expression rescued the inhibitory effect of circBRD7 on the malignant progression of NPC. In addition, circBRD7 demonstrated low expression in NPC tissues, which was positively correlated with BRD7 expression and negatively correlated with the clinical stage of NPC patients. Taken together, circBRD7 attenuates the tumor growth and metastasis of NPC by forming a positive feedback loop with its host gene BRD7, and targeting the circBRD7/BRD7 axis is a promising strategy for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of NPC.",

Data on patients with lung cancer (case) and the general population without lung cancer (non-cancer controls) matched by age, sex and region were obtained from the Korea National Health Insurance Service-National Health Information Database (n=51\u2009586). Insurance premiums were divided into quintiles and medicaid patients. Conditional logistic regression models were used to examine the association between pre-existing lung diseases and the risk of lung cancer. The relationship between income level and the prevalence of pre-existing lung disease among patients with lung cancer was analysed using logistic regression models. The prevalence of asthma (17.3%), chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) (9.3%), pneumonia (9.1%) and pulmonary tuberculosis (1.6%) in patients with lung cancer were approximately 1.6-3.2 times higher compared with the general population without lung cancer. A significantly higher risk for lung cancer was observed in individuals with pre-existing lung diseases (asthma: OR=1.36, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.44; COPD: 2.11, 95%\u2009CI 1.94 to 2.31; pneumonia: 1.49, 95%\u2009CI 1.38 to 1.61; pulmonary tuberculosis: 2.16, 95%\u2009CI 1.75 to 2.66). Patients with lung cancer enrolled in medicaid exhibited higher odds of having pre-existing lung diseases compared with those in the top 20% income level (asthma: OR=1.75, 95%\u2009CI 1.56 to 1.96; COPD: 1.91, 95%\u2009CI 1.65 to 2.21; pneumonia: 1.73, 95%\u2009CI 1.50 to 2.01; pulmonary tuberculosis: 2.45, 95%\u2009CI 1.78 to 3.36).

        "ArticleTitle": "Unraveling the impact of sialic acids on the immune landscape and immunotherapy efficacy in pancreatic cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers. Despite the successful application of immune checkpoint blockade in a range of human cancers, immunotherapy in PDAC remains unsuccessful. PDAC is characterized by a desmoplastic, hypoxic and highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), where T-cell infiltration is often lacking (immune desert), or where T cells are located distant from the tumor islands (immune excluded). Converting the TME to an immune-inflamed state, allowing T-cell infiltration, could increase the success of immunotherapy in PDAC. In this study, we use the KPC3 subcutaneous PDAC mouse model to investigate the role of tumor-derived sialic acids in shaping the tumor immune landscape. A sialic acid deficient KPC3 line was generated by genetic knock-out of the CMAS (cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase) enzyme, a critical enzyme in the synthesis of sialic acid-containing glycans. The effect of sialic acid-deficiency on immunotherapy efficacy was assessed by treatment with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and agonistic CD40. The absence of sialic acids in KPC3 tumors resulted in increased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the TME, and reduced frequencies of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the T-cell population. Importantly, CD8+ T cells were able to infiltrate the tumor islands in sialic acid-deficient tumors. These favorable alterations in the immune landscape sensitized sialic acid-deficient tumors to immunotherapy, which was ineffective in sialic acid-expressing KPC3 tumors. In addition, high expression of sialylation-related genes in human pancreatic cancer correlated with decreased CD8+ T-cell infiltration, increased presence of Tregs, and poorer survival probability. Our results demonstrate that tumor-derived sialic acids mediate T-cell exclusion within the PDAC TME, thereby impairing immunotherapy efficacy. Targeting sialic acids represents a potential strategy to enhance T-cell infiltration and improve immunotherapy outcomes in PDAC.",

In addition to tumor cells, MDR1 is expressed on immune cell subsets in which it confers chemoresistance. Among human T cells, MDR1 is expressed by most CD8+ T cells, and a subset of CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. Here we explored the expression, function and regulation of MDR1 on CD4+ T cells and investigated the role of this population in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in BC. Phenotypic and functional characteristics of MDR1+ CD4 Th cells were assessed on blood from healthy donors and patients with BC by flow cytometry. These features were extended to CD4+ Th cells from untreated breast tumor by flow cytometry and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We performed in vitro polarization assays to decipher MDR1 regulation on CD4 Th cells. We evaluated in vitro the impact of chemotherapy agents on MDR1+ CD4+ Th cells. We analyzed the impact of NAC treatment on MDR1+ CD4+ Th cells from blood and tumors and their association with treatment efficacy in two independent BC cohorts and in a public RNA-seq data set of BC tumor biopsies before and after NAC. Finally, we performed single cell (sc) RNAseq of blood CD4+ memory T cells from NAC-treated patients and combined them with an scRNAseq public data set. MDR1+ CD4 Th cells were strongly enriched in Th1.17 polyfunctional cells but also in Th17 cells, both in blood and untreated breast tumor tissues. Mechanistically, Tumor growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 was required for MDR1 induction during in vitro Th17 or Th1.17 polarization. MDR1 expression conferred a selective advantage to Th1.17 and Th17 cells following paclitaxel treatment in vitro and in vivo in NAC-treated patients. scRNAseq demonstrated MDR1 association with tumor Th1.17 and Th with features of cytotoxic cells. Enrichment in MDR1+ CD4+ Th1.17 and Th17 cells, in blood and tumors positively correlated with pathological response. Absence of early modulation of Th1.17 and Th17 in NAC-resistant patients, argue for its use as a biomarker for chemotherapy regimen adjustment. MDR1 favored the enrichment of Th1.17 and Th17 in blood and tumor after NAC that correlated to clinical response.",

The aim of this study was to develop QIs in paediatric and perinatal care in Japan using an administrative database and confirm the feasibility and applicability of the indicators using a single-site practice test. We used a RAND-modified Delphi method that integrates evidence review with expert consensus development. QI candidates were generated from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) available in English or Japanese and existing QIs in nine selected paediatric or perinatal conditions. Consensus building was based on independent panel ratings. The performance of QIs was retrospectively assessed using data from an administrative database at the National Children's Hospital. Data between April 2018 and March 2019 were used, while data between April 2019 and March 2021 were also used for selected condition, considering the small number of patients. Each QI was calculated as follows: number of times the indicator was met/number of participants\u00d7100. From the literature review conducted between 2010 and 2020, 124 CPGs and 193 existing indicators were identified to generate QI candidates. Through the consensus-building process, 133 QI candidates were assessed and 79 QIs were accepted. The practice test revealed wide variations in the process-level performance of QIs in four categories: patient safety: median 43.9% (IQR 16.7%-85.6%), general paediatrics: median 98.8% (IQR 84.2%-100%), advanced paediatrics: median 94.4% (IQR 46.0%-100%) and advanced obstetrics: median 80.3% (IQR 59.6%-100%). We established 79 QIs for paediatric and perinatal care in Japan using an administrative database that can be applied to hospitals nationwide. The practice test confirmed the measurability of the developed QIs. Benchmarking these QIs will be an attractive approach to improving the quality of care.",

To address this, we completed targeted mutational and methylation sequencing on MMRd ovarian cancer cases. The objective of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism of MMRd using our targeted next generation sequencing panel. Newly diagnosed non-serous/mucinous ovarian cancers (n=215) were prospectively recruited from three cancer centers in Ontario, Canada, between 2015 and 2018. Tumors were reflexively assessed for mismatch repair protein by immunohistochemistry. Matched tumor-normal MMRd cases were analyzed on a custom next generation sequencing panel to identify germline and somatic mutations, copy number variants, rearrangements, and promoter methylation in mismatch repair and associated genes. Of 215 cases, 28 (13%) were MMRd. The MMRd cohort had a median age of 52.3 years (range 33.6-62.2), with mostly stage I (50%) and grade 1 or 2 endometrioid histotype (57%). Of the 28 cases, 22 were available for molecular analysis, and Lynch syndrome was detected in 50% of MMRd cases (11/22; seven ovarian cancer and four synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancer: seven MSH6, two MLH1, one PMS2, and one MSH2). An explanation for the observed mismatch repair phenotype was available for 22/22 deficient cases, including 12 MLH1/PMS2 deficient (nine somatic methylation, one bi-allelic somatic deletion, and two pathogenic germline variant), one PMS2 deficient (one pathogenic germline variant), seven MSH6 deficient (seven pathogenic germline variant), and two MSH2/MSH6 deficient (one pathogenic germline variant and one bi-allelic somatic mutation). Concordance between clinical germline testing and panel sequencing results was 100%. Use of our custom next generation sequencing panel allowed for the streamlined assessment of hereditary and somatic causes of MMRd in ovarian cancers.",

In a single-site, open label phase 1/2 study (NCT03678259), the safety, biodistribution, and sensitivity of a single intravenous infusion of 124I-evuzamitide was assessed in patients with systemic amyloidosis (n = 50), asymptomatic transthyretin sequence variant carriers (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and healthy volunteers (n\u00a0=\u00a05). Subjects were administered 1.4 \u00b1 0.2\u00a0mg of 124I-evuzamitide (71.5 \u00b1 12.4 MBq) and positron emission tomography/x-ray computed tomography images acquired at 5.2 hours (Q25-Q75: 4.9-5.4 hours) postinfusion. Images were assessed visually and semi-quantitatively for positive uptake of radiotracer in the heart and other major organs. Uptake of 124I-evuzamitide in the heart and other abdominothoracic organs was consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and the type of amyloidosis. The patient- and cardiac-associated sensitivity for imaging and clinical observations was 93.6% (95% CI: 82.8%-97.8%) and 96.2% (95% CI: 81.8%-99.8%), respectively. Semi-quantitative uptake of the radiotracer correlated significantly with serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide measurements in patients with light chain-associated amyloidosis. Cardiac uptake was not observed in any healthy volunteers. The agent was well tolerated, with 1 drug-related adverse event and no deaths. 124I-evuzamitide is an amyloid-binding radiotracer capable of detecting cardiac amyloid in patients with high sensitivity.",

To solve these problems, a folate-functionalized carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS)/calcium phosphate hybrid nanoparticle (CF/CaP) with Ca2+ production was designed to treat breast cancer combined with the Ca2+ inhibitory effect of encapsulated curcumin (Cur). It was demonstrated that the optimal CF/CaP nanoparticles loaded with Cur (C@CF/CaP) were spherical nanoparticles, which exhibited a smaller size at about 179\u00a0nm than non-targeted nanoparticles with size at about 234\u00a0nm. C@CF/CaP had good biocompatibility, high stability and acid responsive drug release. Compared with the neutral environment, the cumulative release of Cur was >70\u00a0% after culture for 36\u00a0h at pH\u00a05.0. Compared with non-targeted nanoparticles, C@CF/CaP could specifically target tumor tissues and then enter tumor cells through folate receptor-mediated endocytosis. C@CF/CaP could cause mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, destroy the mitochondrial structure and finally have good anti-tumor efficiency.

Detection and enumeration of CTCs are critical for monitoring cancer progression. Both types of nanostructured cellulose were chemically modified with Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) antibody and iron oxide nanoparticles. The EpCAM antibody facilitated the engagement of CTCs, promoting entrapment within the cellulose cage structure. Iron oxide nanoparticles, on the other hand, rendered the cages activatable via the use of a magnet for the capture and separation of entrapped CTCs. The efficiency of the network structures is shown in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients' blood samples. It was observed that the degree of chemical functionalization of hydroxyl groups located within the CNCs or CNFs with anti-EpCAM determined the efficiency of the system's interaction with CTCs. Further, our result indicated that inflexible scaffolds of nanocrystals interacted more efficiently with CTCs than that of the fibrous CNF scaffolds. Network structures derived from CNCs demonstrated comparable CTC capturing efficiency to commercial standard, OncoDiscover\u00ae.

        "AbstractText": "Hyaluronan (HA) has been widely used to construct nanocarriers for cancer-targeted drug delivery, due to its excellent biocompatibility and intrinsic affinity towards CD44 that is overexpressed in most cancer types. However, the HA-based nanocarriers are prone to trapping in lysosomes following the HA-mediated endocytosis, which limited the delivered drug to access its pharmacological action sites and subsequently compromised the therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this intracellular obstacle, here we demonstrated the co-loading of chloroquine (CQ) in HA nanogel could efficiently promote the intracellular delivery of cisplatin. The cisplatin coordination with HA generated the nanogel that could also co-encapsulate CQ (HA/Cis/CQ nanogel). Compared with cisplatin-loaded HA nanogel (HA/Cis), HA/Cis/CQ significantly promoted the lysosomal escape of cisplatin as well as enhanced tumor inhibition in the triple-negative breast cancer model. Mechanism studies suggested that co-delivery of CQ not only induced the lysosomal membrane permeabilization but also inhibited the lysophagy, which collectively contributed to the lysosomal instability and cisplatin escape. This HA/Cis/CQ nanogel elicited less toxicity compared with the combination of free Cis and CQ, thus suggesting a promising HA nanocarrier to boost the cisplatin delivery towards cancer-targeted therapy.",

Compared with radiologist reports for nodule detection, the software demonstrated sensitivity 54.5% (95% CI 44.2% to 64.4%), specificity 83.2% (82.2% to 84.1%), positive predictive value (PPV) 5.5% (4.6% to 6.6%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 99.0% (98.8% to 99.2%). Compared with cancer diagnosis, the software demonstrated sensitivity 60.9% (50.1% to 70.9%), specificity 83.3% (82.3% to 84.2%), PPV 5.6% (4.8% to 6.6%) and NPV 99.2% (99.0% to 99.4%). Normal or variant anatomy was misidentified as an abnormality in 69.9% of the 943 false positive cases. The software demonstrated considerable underperformance in this real-world patient cohort. Failure analysis suggested a lack of generalisability in the training and testing datasets as a potential factor. The low PPV carries the risk of over-investigation and limits the translation of the software to clinical practice. Our findings highlight the importance of training and testing software in representative datasets, with broader implications for the implementation of AI tools in imaging.",

        "AbstractText": "The primary objective of the Danish Prostate Cancer Consortium Study 1 (DPCC-1) is to provide validation for a novel urine-based microRNA biomarker, called uCaP, for a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Eligible participants are biopsy na\u00efve men aged \u226518 years with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels \u22653 ng/mL, who are referred to prostate MRI due to suspicion of PC at one of the following three major urology/uroradiology centers: Aarhus University Hospital, Herlev & Gentofte University Hospital, or Odense University Hospital, where MRI and targeted biopsy are implemented in clinical use. Exclusion criteria include previous diagnosis of urogenital cancer, contraindication to MRI, gender reassignment treatment or PSA level >20\u2009ng/mL. The participants will be asked to donate a urine sample in connection with their MRI. The study is observational, uses a diagnostic accuracy testing setup and will integrate into the current diagnostic pathway.We will measure the levels of the three microRNAs in the uCaP model (miR-222-3\u2009p, miR-24-3\u2009p and miR-30c-5p) in extracellular vesicle-enriched cell-free urine samples, to assess if uCaP can improve specificity and retain sensitivity for International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group \u22652\u2009PC, when used as a reflex test to PSA \u22653\u2009ng/mL. We hypothesise that uCaP can improve selection for prostate MRI and reduce the number of unnecessary scans and biopsies. This study is approved by the Central Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics (reference number: 1-10-72-85-22). All participants will provide written informed consent. Study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented in scientific meetings. NCT05767307 at clinicaltrials.gov.",

Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and thematic framework analysis. Four ICUs over three hospital sites in London, UK. Former ICU patients or their relatives/carers with personal experience of ICU rehabilitation. ICU clinicians, including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, involved in the delivery of physical rehabilitation or decisions over its initiation. Views and experiences on the barriers and facilitators to ICU physical rehabilitation. Interviews were carried out with 11 former patients, 3 family members and 16 clinicians. The themes generated related to: safety and physiological concerns, patient participation and engagement, clinician experience and knowledge, teamwork, equipment and environment and risks and benefits of rehabilitation in intensive care. The overarching theme for overcoming barriers was a change in working model from ICU clinicians having separate responsibilities (a multidisciplinary approach) to one where all parties have a shared aim of providing patient-centred ICU physical rehabilitation (an interdisciplinary approach). The results have revealed barriers that can be modified to improve rehabilitation delivery in an ICU. Interdisciplinary working could overcome many of these barriers to optimise recovery from critical illness.",

        "AbstractText": "N-terminal processing by methionine aminopeptidases (MetAP) is a crucial step in the maturation of proteins during protein biosynthesis. Small molecule inhibitors of MetAP2 have anti-angiogenic and antitumoral activity. Herein, we characterize the structurally novel MetAP2 inhibitor M8891. M8891 is a potent, selective, reversible small molecule inhibitor blocking the growth of human endothelial cells and differentially inhibiting cancer cell growth. A CRISPR genome-wide screen identified the tumor suppressor p53 and MetAP1/MetAP2 as determinants of resistance and sensitivity to pharmacological MetAP2 inhibition. A newly identified substrate of MetAP2, translation elongation factor 1-alpha-1 (EF1a-1), served as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to follow target inhibition in cell and mouse studies. Robust angiogenesis and tumor growth inhibition was observed with M8891 monotherapy. In combination with VEGF receptor inhibitors, tumor stasis and regression occurred in patient-derived xenograft renal cell carcinoma (RCC) models, particularly those that were p53 wild-type, had Von Hippel-Landau gene (VHL) loss-of-function mutations, and a mid/high MetAP1/2 expression score.",

        "AbstractText": "Continuous tobacco use in cancer patients is linked to substantial healthcare costs due to increased risks and complications, whereas quitting smoking leads to improved treatment outcomes and cost reductions. Addressing the need for empirical evidence on the economic impact of smoking cessation, this study examined the association between smoking cessation and healthcare cost utilization among a sample of 930 cancer patients treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center's Tobacco Research and Treatment Program (TRTP). Applying conditional quantile regression and propensity scores to address confounding, our findings revealed that abstinence achieved through the TRTP significantly reduced the median cost during a 3-month period post-quitting by $1,095 (\u03b2=-$1,095, p=0.007, 95%CI=[-$1,886, -$304]). Sensitivity analysis corroborated these conclusions, showing a pronounced cost reduction when outlier data were excluded. The long-term accrued cost savings from smoking cessation could potentially offset the cost of participation in the TRTP program, underscoring its cost-effectiveness. An important implication of this study is that by reducing smoking rates, healthcare systems can more efficiently allocate resources, enhance patient health outcomes, and lessen the overall cancer burden.",

        "AbstractText": "Malignant tumors represent a significant health challenge, critically impacting human well-being. Historically, the focus has been on leveraging the biochemical cues of tumors for both diagnosis and treatment. While valuable, this strategy does not capture the full complexity of tumor diagnosis and management. Recently, the integration of biomechanics and mechanobiology with oncology has highlighted the importance of mechanical cues, which have emerged as new hallmarks of tumors, opening potential novel routes for cancer diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Despite the advances, a thorough literature review suggests a pronounced gap in our understanding of the mechanical properties of tumors. The clinical community has not yet completely recognized the diagnostic and therapeutic relevance of the mechanical cues of tumors. To bridge this knowledge gap, we propose and introduce the paradigm of \"Tumor Mechanomedicine\". We provide a comprehensive overview of the multi-scale mechanical characteristics of tumors, exploring their influence on tumor biology, from the aspects of tumor biomechanics, tumor mechanobiology, tumor mechanodiagnostics, and tumor mechanotherapeutics. By elucidating the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of these mechanical cues, we aim to furnish the oncology community with fresh insights, paving the way for innovative solutions to persistent clinical conundrums. \u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u547d\u5065\u5eb7\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u4e34\u5e8a\u96be\u9898\u5f85\u89e3\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u529b\u5b66\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0e\u80bf\u7624\u5b66\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u65ad\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u529b\u5b66\u56e0\u7d20\u9010\u6e10\u6210\u4e3a\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8c03\u63a7\u80bf\u7624\u53d1\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u80bf\u7624\u8bca\u7597\u7684\u65b0\u9776\u70b9\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5bf9\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u4e5f\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u638c\u63e1\u5176\u5728\u8bca\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u603b\u7ed3\u56fd\u5185\u5916\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u201c\u80bf\u7624\u529b\u533b\u5b66\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ece\u80bf\u7624\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u529b\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u529b\u8bca\u65ad\u5b66\u548c\u80bf\u7624\u529b\u6cbb\u7597\u5b66\u56db\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u80bf\u7624\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u8bca\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u80bf\u7624\u8bca\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002.",

We aimed to improve the plasma stability of EPI-X4 analogues without compromising CXCR4 antagonism. Our findings revealed that only the peptide N-terminus is prone to degradation. Consequently, incorporating d-amino acids or acetyl groups in this region enhanced peptide stability in plasma. Notably, EPI-X4 leads 5, 27, and 28 not only retained their CXCR4 binding and antagonism but also remained stable in plasma for over 8 h. Molecular dynamic simulations showed that these modified analogues bind similarly to CXCR4 as the original peptide. To further increase their systemic half-lives, we conjugated these stabilized analogues with large polymers and albumin binders. These advances highlight the potential of the optimized EPI-X4 analogues as promising CXCR4-targeted therapeutics and set the stage for more detailed preclinical assessments.",

It helps in supplying oxygen and nutrients to tumor cells and plays a crucial role in the local progression and distant metastasis of, and development of treatment resistance in breast cancer. Tumor angiogenesis is currently regarded as a critical therapeutic target; however, anti-angiogenic therapy for breast cancer fails to produce satisfactory results, owing to issues such as inconsistent efficacy and significant adverse reactions. As a result, new anti-angiogenic drugs are urgently needed. Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds found in many foods, are inexpensive, widely available, and exhibit a broad range of biological activities, low toxicity, and favorable safety profiles. Several studies find that various flavonoids inhibit angiogenesis in breast cancer, indicating great therapeutic potential. In this review, we summarize the role of angiogenesis in breast cancer and the potential of natural flavonoids as anti-angiogenic agents for breast cancer treatment.

Surface modification of drug loaded liposomes with Tf and/or PD was carried out. Formulations were characterized using FTIR, DSC, 1HNMR, XRD and TEM. Tf-conjugated LTZ liposomes (LTf) and Tf/D-2-conjugated LTZ liposomes (LTfD-2) showed greater cytotoxic potential (IC50 = 95.03 \u00b5g/mL and 23.75 \u00b5g/mL respectively) with enhanced cellular uptake in MCF7 cells compared to plain LTZ. Blocking studies of Tf (Tf-receptor mediated internalization) revealed decreased uptake of LTf and LTfD-2 confirming the role of Tf in uptake of Tf-conjugated liposomes. Intravenous treatment with LTfD-2 caused highest reduction in tumor volumes of female BALB/c-nude mice (145 mm3) compared to plain LTZ (605 mm3) and unconjugated LTZ liposomes (LP) (300 mm3).

This effect is likely to be amplified in combination with immune modulators. Unfortunately, free drugs without targeting capacity would receive poor outcomes and strong side effects. To address these issues, in this work, an acid-sensitive micelle based on an amphiphilic poly(\u03b2-amino ester) derivative was constructed to co-deliver IRT and the immune adjuvant imiquimod (IMQ), termed PII. PII kept stable under normal physiological conditions. After internalization by tumor cells, PII dissociated in acidic lysosomes and released IRT and IMQ rapidly. In the CT26 tumor mouse model, PII increased the intra-tumoral SN38 (the active metabolite of IRT) and IMQ concentrations by up to 9.39 and 3.44 times compared with the free drug solution. The tumor inhibition rate of PII achieved 87.29%. This might profit from that IRT induced ICD, which promoted dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and intra-tumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells. In addition, IMQ enhanced the antigen presenting ability of DCs and stimulated tumor associated macrophages to secrete tumor-killing cytokines. PII provided an effective strategy to combat colorectal cancer by synergy of chemotherapy and immunoregulation.",

        "AbstractText": "Bone metastatic disease of prostate cancer (PCa) is incurable and progression in bone is largely dictated by tumor-stromal interactions in the bone microenvironment. We showed previously that bone neutrophils initially inhibit bone metastatic PCa growth yet metastatic PCa becomes resistant to neutrophil response. Further, neutrophils isolated from tumor-bone lost their ability to suppress tumor growth through unknown mechanisms. With this study, our goal was to define the impact of metastatic PCa on neutrophil function throughout tumor progression and to determine the potential of neutrophils as predictive biomarkers of metastatic disease. Using patient peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), we identified that PCa progression dictates PMN cell surface markers and gene expression, but not cytotoxicity against PCa. Importantly, we also identified a novel phenomenon in which second generation androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) suppresses PMN cytotoxicity via increased transforming growth factor beta receptor I (T\u03b2RI). High dose testosterone and genetic or pharmacologic T\u03b2RI inhibition rescued androgen receptor-mediated neutrophil suppression and restored neutrophil anti-tumor immune response.

        "ArticleTitle": "Hypoxia promotes the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells by suppressing ferroptosis via upregulating SLC2A12.",
        "AbstractText": "Ovarian cancer has been a worldwide health burden for women and its progression is highly hypoxia-independent. Here, we investigated the exact mechanisms by which hypoxia contributes to the malignant progression of ovarian cancer. MTT, transwell, colony formation, and scratch wound healing assays were carried out for cellular functions. The underlying mechanism by which hypoxia functions was explored by RNA-seq, enrichment analysis, western blotting, qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, ChIP, luciferase reporter, and ELISA. Finally, animal experiments including the xenograft model and tumor metastasis model were constructed to validate the role of SLC2A12 in vivo. Hypoxia treatment promoted the cell proliferation, mobility, and colony growth abilities of the two ovarian cancer cell lines HO-8910 and A2780. RNA-seq and enrichment analysis showed that SLC2A12 was hyper-expressed under hypoxia condition and it may be related to glutathione and lipid metabolism. Besides, the expression of SLC2A12 was negatively correlated with overall survival. Hypoxia suppressed ferroptosis by SLC2A12 because silencing SLC2A12 declined the cell viability of HO-8910 and A2780\u202fcells under hypoxia conditions, while the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) breached that result and upregulated the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Moreover, hypoxia increased the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 A (HIF-1A), and the accumulated HIF-1A binds to hypoxia inducible factor 1\u202fB (HIF1B) to form HIF-1 complex, then promoted the binding of hypoxic response elements (HRE) to SLC2A12 promoter by HIF-1/HRE signal. Subsequently, SLC2A12 regulated glutathione metabolism and in turn inhibited ferroptosis. The animal experiments indicated that silencing SLC2A12 could significantly inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Hypoxia promoted ovarian cancer progression by upregulating SLC2A12 and then regulating glutathione metabolism to inhibit ferroptosis.",

        "ArticleTitle": "In vitro determination of probiotic efficacy of Bacillus subtilis TLDK301120C24 isolated from tilapia against warm water fish pathogens and in vivo validation using gnotobiotic zebrafish model.",
        "AbstractText": "Eco-friendly alternatives such as probiotics are needed to prevent economically relevant infectious diseases for a successful disease-free harvest in aquaculture. The use of antibiotics has been the favored practice, but its empirical and indiscriminate use has led to antibiotic resistance in the aquatic environment and residues in the food fish. With this rationale, a probiotic was isolated from tilapia, a commercially important cultured fish worldwide. The characteristics of the probiotic were checked against common bacterial pathogens affecting aquaculture. In vitro tests demonstrated the inhibitory effects of the isolated probiotic on the growth of Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, Vibrio anguillarum, and V. alginolyticus. The candidate probiotic, referred to as TLDK301120C24, was identified as Bacillus subtilis by a battery of biochemical tests and genotypic confirmation by 16S rDNA sequencing. The in vitro results revealed the ability of the probiotic to withstand the gut conditions that included pH range of 3-9, salt concentration of 0.5-6%, and bile salt concentration of up to 6%. The isolate could hydrolyze starch (12-14\u202fmm clearance zone), protein (20-22\u202fmm clearance zone), and cellulose (22-24\u202fmm clearance zone). Further, the inhibitory ability of the probiotic against aquatic pathogens was determined in vivo using gnotobiotic zebrafish by employing a novel approach that involved tagging the probiotic with a red fluorescent protein and the pathogens with a green fluorescent protein, respectively. The colonizing ability of probiotics and its inhibitory effects against the pathogens were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy, PCR, and estimation of viable counts in LBA\u00a0+\u00a0Amp plates. Finally, the competitive inhibition and exclusion of fish pathogens A. hydrophila and E. tarda by B. subtilis was confirmed semi-quantitatively, through challenge experiments. This study shows the potential of B. subtilis as a probiotic and its excellent ability to inhibit major fish pathogens in vivo and in vitro. It also shows promise as a potent substitute for antibiotics.",

Mutated KRAS is a major cause that leads cancer cell proliferation. Chemotherapy is still the major treatment for pancreatic cancer. Alternatively, repositioning old drug to inhibit mutated KRAS may be a cost-effective way for pancreatic cancer treatment. In this study, we choose mutated KRAS (G12D) as a target. Based on mutated KRAS GTP binding domain (hydrolyze GTP to GDP), we perform virtual screening on FDA-approved drugs. Montelukast shows strong binding affinity to mutated KRAS as well as interfering both GTP and GDP binding to mutated KRAS. Furthermore, Montelukast shows very strong anti-proliferation effect on mutated KRAS pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our results support repositioning of Montelukast as single agent for pancreatic cancer treatment.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Compensation of concomitant field effects in double diffusion encoding by means of added oscillating gradients.",
        "AbstractText": "Maxwell or concomitant fields imprint additional phases on the transverse magnetization. This concomitant phase may cause severe image artifacts like signal voids or distort the quantitative parameters due to the induced intravoxel dephasing. In particular, double diffusion encoding (DDE) schemes with two pairs of bipolar diffusion weighting gradients separated by a refocusing radiofrequency (RF) pulse are prone to concomitant field-induced artifacts. In this work, a method for reducing concomitant field effects in these DDE sequences based on additional oscillating gradients is presented. These oscillating gradient pulses obtained by constrained optimization were added to the original gradient waveforms. The modified sequences reduced the accumulated concomitant phase without significant changes in the original sequence characteristics. The proposed method was applied to a DDE acquisition scheme consisting of 60 pairs of diffusion wave vectors. For phantom as well as for in vivo experiments, a considerable increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was obtained. For phantom measurements with a diffusion weighting of b\u202f=\u202f2000\u202fs/mm2 for each of the gradient pairs, an SNR increase of up to 40% was observed for a transversal slice that had a distance of 5\u202fcm from the isocenter. For equivalent slice parameters, in vivo measurements in the brain of a healthy volunteer exhibited an increase in SNR of up to 35% for b\u202f=\u202f750\u202fs/mm2 for each weighting. These findings are supported by corresponding simulations, which also predict a positive effect on the SNR. In summary, the presented method leads to an SNR gain without additional RF refocusing pulses.",

Multi-shot EPI was also implemented to minimize distortion and blurring while enabling high in-plane resolution. A dictionary-matching approach was used to fit the images to quantitative parameter maps, which were compared to T1 measured by modified Look-Locker (MOLLI), T1 measured by variable flip angle (VFA), T2 measured by multiple echo time-based Half Fourier Single-shot Turbo spin-Echo (HASTE), T2 measured by radial turbo-spin-echo (rTSE) and T2\u204e measured by multiple gradient echo (MGRE) sequences.

        "AbstractText": "We investigated the presence of aluminium (Al) in human colon cancer samples and its potential association with biological processes involved in cancer progression, such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell death. 25 consecutive colon samples were collected from patients undergoing colonic resection. Both neoplastic and normal mucosa were collected from each patient and subjected to histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses. Moreover, colon samples from two Al-positive patients underwent multi-omic analyses, including whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Morin staining, used to identify in situ aluminium bioaccumulation, showed the presence of Al in tumor areas of 24\u202f% of patients. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis confirmed the presence of Al specifically in intracytoplasmic electrondense nanodeposits adjacent to mitochondria of colon cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analyses for vimentin and nuclear \u03b2-catenin were performed to highlight the occurrence of the EMT phenomenon in association to Al bioaccumulation. Al-positive samples showed a significant increase in both the number of vimentin-positive and nuclear \u03b2-catenin-positive cancer cells compared to Al-negative samples. Moreover, Al-positive samples exhibited a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells, as well as the expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule BCL-2. Multi-omic analyses revealed a higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) in Al-positive colon cancers (n\u202f=\u202f2) compared to a control cohort (n\u202f=\u202f100). Additionally, somatic mutations in genes associated with EMT (GATA3) and apoptosis (TP53) were observed in Al-positive colon cancers. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence of Al bioaccumulation in colon cancer and its potential role in modulating molecular pathways involved in cancer progression, such as EMT and apoptosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Al toxicity might contribute to improve strategies for prevention, early detection, and targeted therapies for the management of colon cancer patients.",

        "AbstractText": "The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, a highly industrialized area in China, boasts a concentration of coking plants that constitute a vital component of the steel industry. In recent years, the Chinese government has implemented measures including backward production capacity elimination (BPCE), ultra-low emission technology transformation (ULET), and deep treatment of volatile organic compounds (DTV), to promote technological progress in the coking industry and mitigate the impact of pollutant emissions. This study focuses on the emission trends, reduction effects of various measures, and the impact on air quality and human health in the regional scale. The findings reveal that in 2015, the emissions of PM, SO2, NOx and VOCs of the coking industry in BTH region were 29.15, 9.64, 26.62 and 82.99 Gg (1000 tons/year) respectively. However, by 2019, these emissions had significantly decreased by 19.95, 5.78, 18.69, and 22.53 Gg, respectively. Of these reductions, ULET contributed about 80.3\u202f% of NOx and SO2, and 57.4\u202f% of PM. Meanwhile, DTV and BPCE contributed 49.2\u202f% and 50.7\u202f% of VOCs emission reduction, respectively. Despite the improvement effect on PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 is limited, the substantial decrease in VOCs (particularly benzene) resulted in a significant reduction in the coking industry's contribution to the atmospheric benzene concentration, dropping from 15.9\u202f% in 2015 to 11.6\u202f% in 2019. Moreover, the lifetime cancer risk (LCR) contribution of benzene inhalation in the BTH region also decreased from 1.7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-6 to 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-6. Looking ahead to 2025, the continued implementation of DTV will be expected to reduce VOCs emissions by 24.41Gg. This will bring the industry's contribution to the benzene concentration down to 6.8\u202f% and the cancer risk of the population to an acceptable level (LCR\u202f<\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-6). Additionally, the deep treatment of VOCs in coking plants will significantly reduce the health risks faced by people living in the vicinity of the plants.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Evaluating the Safe Zone for Lumbar Pedicle Screws: Are Midline Crossing Screws Indicative of Pedicle Breach?",
        "AbstractText": "Pedicle screw breach (PSB) is not uncommon following lumbar instrumentation, and in some instances, it may lead to vascular and/or neurologic complications. Previous literature suggested that screws crossing the vertebral midline on an anterior-posterior (AP) radiograph (or midsagittal on CT) are concerning for medial pedicle breach. Our primary aim was to map out the safe zones (SZ) of bilateral pedicle instrumentation and their relationship at each lumbar vertebral level. Our secondary aim was to evaluate the presence of SZs' intersection at each lumbar level, denoting safe midline pedicle screw crossing not otherwise associated with medial pedicle breach. Retrospective Anatomical Study PATIENT SAMPLE: Adult patients in the from \"The Cancer Imaging Archive\" (TCIA) database who have not had thoraco-lumbo-sacral fusion. Physiologic measures obtained through 3D analysis of CT images and virtual pedicle screws. CT scans of 51 patients were randomly selected from \"The Cancer Imaging Archive\" (TCIA) online database for analysis. The Sectra 3D Spine software was used to create 3D renderings, place virtual screws, and make measurements. At each lumbar vertebra, the right and left pedicle corridors were mapped. At each pedicle, two screw positions were templated, the \"medial limit screw\" (MLS) and the \"lateral limit screw\" (LLS). Each limit screw was the most extreme position that the screw could exist in without causing a medial or lateral breach. The safe zone was defined as the zone between MLS and LLS. Measurements were taken for each level (between L1-L5) and side (Left, Right). A total of 253 lumbar vertebrae from 51 patients (mean age 53.1, 56.9% male) were included. Two vertebrae from two patients were removed for poor image quality. Out of the 506 screw positions analyzed in our study, 97.4% had overlapping SZ and crossed the midplane without medial pedicle breach. The significant factors (p < 0.01) for safe midplane-crossing screws included: the screw length (L1-L5); the laterality of the screw entry point (L1-L4); and the pedicle diameter (L2 and L5). A midline crossing pedicle screw on a lumbar AP radiograph is not necessarily indicative of a medial pedicle screw breach. Anatomical (i.e. larger pedicle diameter) and technical (i.e. longer screws, and lateral entry points) factors allow for safety zone intersections and indicate safe midline crossing by pedicle screws.",

Genes related to BC LNM were screened, and a risk model was constructed based on LASSO-Cox analysis. Combined with the Kaplan-Meier curve, the ability of riskscore to distinguish different baseline characteristics was evaluated, and model was verified by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The expression levels of prognostic marker genes were analyzed by q-PCR and western blot (WB). A higher survival rate and longer survival time in low-risk BC patients. The 1, 3 and 5\u202fyear AUC values of the training set were 0.79, 0.74, and 0.73, respectively. Results for the validation set was similar to the training set. The differentially expressed genes between the high- and low-risk groups were significantly enriched in immune pathways. In addition, the low-risk group had higher levels of immune infiltration. q-PCR and WB results showed that in BC, CDH10, SMR3A, POU3F2, and FABP7 were down-regulated, and LHX1 was up-regulated. We built a prognostic model of BC based on LNM-related genes, proffering evaluation for prognosis and precise cure of BC. At present, the genes related to lymph node metastasis in BC are still largely unknown and need to be further explored. Searching for potential lymph node metastasis-related genes of BC will provide meaningful biomarkers for BC treatment. Based on TCGA-BRCA data, we established an effective 11-gene prognostic risk model that could predict patient outcomes independently. Our model could classify BC patients and distinguish patients with poor prognosis effectively. Besides, the feature genes we identified might exert a predictive function in immunotherapy.

Our aim was to assess the impact of 12\u202fmonths of telephone collaborative care (tCC) versus enhanced usual care (eUC) on depression and drinking. We performed a secondary analysis of the Primary care Assessment and Research of a Telephone intervention for Neuropsychiatric conditions with Education and Resources study (PARTNERs), a blinded randomized controlled trial. We examined 144 participants with comorbid depression and at-risk drinking, of which 129 were from the original sample whose data have been published, and 15 were studied since the original report had been published. PARTNERs compared eUC consisting of usual care plus assessment of symptoms at baseline, and 4, 8, and 12\u202fmonths later vs. tCC consisting of eUC plus telephone-based coaching and symptom monitoring provided by a lay mental health technician to patients supervised by a psychiatrist. The study assessed depression response and remission using logistic regression; we assessed trajectory of drinking using Generalized-estimating equations (GEE). Baseline factors associated with likelihood of not exceeding number of drinks at 12\u202fmonths were identified using decision trees. tCC produced a faster decline in the number of drinks than eUC (Wald \u03a72\u202f=\u202f9.47, p\u202f=\u202f0.02). However, drinking and depression outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups at the end of treatment. Higher alcohol consumption at baseline (\u226518 standard drinks per week in the tCC group and \u226511 standard drinks per week in the eUC group) was associated with a higher likelihood of having at-risk drinking after 12\u202fmonths of treatment.

Both treatments were equally effective at the end of treatment for both depression and drinking outcomes.",

It is also well known that declarative memory and anxiety levels are impaired in schizophrenia. However, apart from the novel object recognition test, the possibilities for testing memory in zebrafish are quite limited. For these reasons, we designed a novel memory test based on rewards, a learning period, and zebrafish's natural preference for certain colors. Among the results, our fish preferred the color yellow over red, and we illustrated that ketamine and its combination with methionine provide a robust model that seems to better represent the aspects of schizophrenia in animal models. Moreover, surprisingly, we observed that microplastics (more precisely, polypropylene fibers) ingested by animals through the diet seem to act as a buffer against ketamine toxicity and as an enhancer for methionine exposure. Moreover, according to our results, groups with higher anxiety levels seem to perform better on the memory test.",

Although ciprofloxacin (CIP) prophylaxis is recommended, information on serum levels and clinical course is lacking. Thus, we aimed at investigating relationships between CIP-levels and prophylaxis-failure; especially whether different pharmacokinetic (PK)-indices (AUC0-24h vs. single time samples) correlate differently with the outcome. We conducted a prospective observational monocentric study at a 1,500-bed teaching hospital (2018/03/18-2019/03/19), including 63 adult alloHSCT-patients receiving CIP-prophylaxis. Blood samples were drawn at three sampling-times (1h, 6h and 12h post administration), twice-a-week, and measured via HPLC. Onset of febrile episodes (FEB) indicated suspected ciprofloxacin prophylaxis failure. Events of positive blood-cultures (bloodstream infection; BSI) indicated confirmed prophylaxis-failure. Seven out of 63 patients died without significant differences in their average CIP-levels compared to survivors, with FEB-patients (54/63) displaying a 13%, 95% CI: 4 - 22% lower probability to survive. We obtained 225 triplets from 58 primary CIP-episodes. Triplets preceding BSI with gram-negative bacteria (GNB-BSI) showed lower AUC0-24h on average, but indifferent single time sample indices. An AUC0-24h of \u2264 21.61 mgh/L resulted in 4-fold higher odds of GNB-BSI (ORadj = 3.96, 95% CI: 1.21 - 13.00). These results were independent of the administration route, patient demographics or sampling protocol deviations, indicating reduced CIP-exposure upon GNB-BSI events.

Previously, we reported isolation of GM3-binding vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor by the T7 phage display method (Chung et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2013). To further identify novel proteins interacting with GM3, we extended the T7 phage display method in this study. After T7 phage display biopanning combined with immobilized biotin-labeled 3'-sialyllactose prepared on a streptavidin-coated microplate, we isolated 100 candidate sequences from the human lung cDNA library. The most frequently detected clones from the blast analysis were the human nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (NOLC1) sequences. We initially identified NOLC1 as a molecule that possibly binds to GM3 and confirmed this binding ability using the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Herein, we report another GM3-interacting protein, NOLC1, that can be isolated by the T7 phage display method. These results are expected to be helpful for elucidating the functional roles of ganglioside GM3 with NOLC1. When human breast cancer MCF-7\u202fcells were examined for subcellular localization of NOLC1, immunofluorescence of NOLC1 was observed in the intracellular region. In addition, NOLC1 expression was increased in the nucleolus after treatment with the anticancer drug doxorubicin. GM3 and NOLC1 levels in the doxorubicin-treated MCF-7\u202fcells were correlated, indicating possible associations between GM3 and NOLC1.

However, synthesis of 2 involves a total of 19 steps, including a cyclization process that accompanies a strong odor due to the use of Lawesson's reagent and an epimerization reaction; furthermore, 2 exhibited insufficient selectivity for HPSE1 over exo-\u03b2-d-glucuronidase (GUS\u03b2) and glucocerebrosidase (GBA), which also needed to be addressed. First, the cyclization reaction was optimized to synthesize tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine without using Lawesson's reagent or epimerization, with reference to previous reports. Next, 16 and 17 containing a bulkier substituent at position 6 than the 6-methoxyl group in 2 were designed and synthesized using the improved cyclization conditions, so that the synthetic route of 16 and 17 was shortened by five steps as compared with that of 2. The inhibitory activities of 16 and 17 against GUS\u03b2 and GBA were reduced as compared with those of 2, that is, the compounds showed improved selectivity for HPSE1 over GUS\u03b2 and GBA. In addition, 16 showed enhanced inhibitory activity against HPSE1 as compared with that of 2. Compound 16 appears promising as an HPSE1 inhibitor with therapeutic potential due to its highly potent inhibitory activity against HPSE1 with high selectivity for HPSE1.",

Rehd. et Wils. var. cinereum Rehd. et Wils. and S. acutum (Thunb.) Rehd. et Wils. For the therapeutic treatment of rheumatism, acute arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis based on Qingfengteng, sinomenine hydrochloride was recently made the principal active ingredient in various dosage forms. 8-Bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid (CPI-613) was an orphan medicine that the FDA and EMA approved orphan for the treatment of certain resistant malignancies. Its unique mode of action and minimal toxicity toward normal tissues made for an apt pharmacophore. In order to expand the field of sinomenine anticancer structures, sinomenine/8-Bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid derivatives were designed and synthesized. Among them, target hybrids e4 stood out for having notable cytotoxic effects against cancer cell lines, especially for K562 cells, with IC50 values of 2.45\u202f\u03bcM and high safety. In-depth investigations demonstrated that e4 caused apoptosis by stopping the cell cycle at G1 phase, and doing so by altering the morphology of the nucleus and causing membrane potential of the in mitochondria to collapse.

        "AbstractText": "Corosolic acid (CA) is a plant-derived terpenoid compound with many health benefits. However, the anti-tumor effects of CA in bladder cancer remain unexplored. Here, we found that CA inhibited bladder tumor both in vitro and in vivo, and had no significant toxicity in mice. With the aid of transcriptomics and proteomics, we elucidated the regulatory network mechanism of CA inhibiting bladder cancer. Through cell viability detection, cell fluorescence staining and flow cytometry, we discovered that CA inhibited bladder cancer mainly through blocking cell cycle. Interestingly, CA played anticancer roles by distinct mechanisms at different concentrations: low concentrations (<7.0\u202f\u03bcg/mL) of CA mainly inhibited DNA synthesis by downregulating TOP2A and LIG1, and diminished mitosis by downregulating CCNA2, CCNB1, CDC20, and RRM2; high concentrations (\u22657.0\u202f\u03bcg/mL) of CA induced cell death through triggering mitophagy via upregulating NBR1, TAXBP1, SQSTM1/P62, and UBB. CA, as a natural molecule of homology of medicine and food, is of great significance for the prevention and treatment of cancer patients following clarifying its anti-cancer mechanism. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the pharmacological mechanism of CA inhibition in bladder cancer, which is helpful for the development of new anti-tumor drugs based on CA.",

        "AbstractText": "The goal of this study was to evaluate the image quality provided by a novel cone beam CT (CBCT) platform (HyperSightTM, Varian Medical Systems), a platform with enhanced reconstruction algorithms as well as rapid acquisition times. Image quality was compared to both status quo CBCT for image guidance, and to fan beam CT (FBCT) acquired on a CT simulator (CTsim). In a clinical study, 30 subjects were recruited for whom either deep inspiration (DIBH) or deep exhalation breath hold (DEBH) was used during imaging and radiation treatment of tumors involving liver, lung, breast, abdomen, chest wall and pancreatic sites. All subjects were imaged during breath hold with CBCT on a standard image guidance platform (TrueBeam\u00ae 2.7, Varian Medical Systems) and FBCT CT (CTsim, GE Optima). HyperSight imaging with both breath hold (HSBH) and free breathing (HSFB) was performed in a single session. The four image sets thus acquired were registered and compared using metrics quantifying artifact index (AI), image non-uniformity, contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and difference of HU from CTsim. HSBH provided less severe artifacts compared to both HSFB and TrueBeam. The severity of artifacts in HSBH images was similar to that in CTsim images, with statistically similar AI values. CTsim provided the best image uniformity, however HSBH provided improved uniformity compared to both HSFB and TrueBeam. CTsim demonstrated elevated contrast compared to HyperSight imaging, but both HSBH and HSFB imaging showed superior CNR characteristics compared to TrueBeam. The median HU difference of HSBH from CTsim was within 1 HU for muscle/fat tissue, 12 HU for bone and 14 HU for lung. The HyperSight system provides six-second CBCT acquisition with image artifacts that are significantly reduced compared to TrueBeam and comparable to those in CTsim FBCT imaging. HyperSight breath hold imaging was of higher quality compared to free breathing imaging on the same system. The median HU value in HyperSight breath hold imaging is within 15 HU of that in CT simulation imaging for muscle, fat, bone and lung tissue types, indicating the utility of image data for direct dose calculation in adaptive workflows.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Quantifying the Impact of Cancer on the Viscoelastic Properties of the Prostate Gland using a Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic Model.",
        "AbstractText": "Pathological disorders can alter the mechanical properties of biological tissues, and studying such changes can help to better understand the disease progression. The prostate gland is no exception, as previous studies have shown that cancer can affect its mechanical properties. However, most of these studies have focused on the elastic properties of the tissue and have overlooked the impact of cancer on its viscous response. To address this gap, we used a quasi-linear viscoelastic model to investigate the impact of cancer on both the elastic and viscous characteristics of the prostate gland. By comparing the viscoelastic properties of segments influenced by cancer and those unaffected by cancer in 49 fresh prostates, removed within two hours after prostatectomy surgery, we were able to determine the influence of cancer grade and tumor volume on the tissue. Our findings suggest that tumor volume significantly affects both the elastic modulus and viscosity of the prostate (p-value less than 2%). Specifically, we showed that cancer increases Young's modulus and shear relaxation modulus by 20%. These results have implications for using mechanical properties of the prostate as a potential biomarker for cancer. However, developing an in vivo apparatus to measure these properties remains a challenge that needs to be addressed in future research. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to explore how cancer impacts the mechanical properties of prostate tissues using a quasi-linear viscoelastic model. We examined 49 fresh prostate samples collected immediately after surgery and correlated their properties with cancer presence identified in pathology reports. Our results demonstrate a 20% change in the viscoelastic properties of the prostate due to cancer. We initially validated our approach using tissue-mimicking phantoms and then applied it to differentiate between cancerous and normal prostate tissues. These findings offer potential for early cancer detection by assessing these properties. However, conducting these tests in vivo remains a challenge for future research.",

Extensive research has been conducted to assess the factors responsible for the presence of DDVP in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as the entire food chain. Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of DDVP metabolites in the food chain and their toxicity to mammals. These studies emphasize that both immediate and chronic exposure to DDVP can disrupt the host's homeostasis, leading to multi-organ damage. Furthermore, as a potent carcinogen, DDVP can induce cancer and harm aquatic systems. Therefore, understanding the contamination of DDVP and its toxicological effects on both plants and mammals is vital for minimizing potential risks and enhancing safety in the future. This review aimed to comprehensively consolidate information about the distribution, ecological effects, and health impacts of DDVP, as well as its metabolism, detection, prevention, and remediation strategies. In summary, this study observed the distribution of DDVP contaminations in vegetables and fruits, which results in significant toxicity to humans. Although several detection and bioremediation strategies are emerging, the improper application of DDVP and the alarming level of DDVP contamination in foods lead to human toxicity that requires attention.",

Most data on amiodarone-related ILD are derived from periods when amiodarone was given at higher doses than currently used. A nationwide population-based study was conducted among patients with incident atrial fibrillation (AF) between 1 December 1999 and 31 December 31 2021. Amiodarone-exposed patients were matched 1:1 with controls unexposed to amiodarone based on age, sex, ethnicity, and AF diagnosis duration. The final patient cohort included only matched pairs where amiodarone therapy was consistent throughout follow-up. Directed acyclic graphs and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) modelling were used. Patients with either prior ILD or primary lung cancer (PLC) were excluded. The primary outcome was the incidence of any ILD. Secondary endpoints were death and PLC. The final cohort included 6039 amiodarone-exposed patients who were matched with unexposed controls. The median age was 73.3 years, and 51.6% were women. After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, ILD occurred in 242 (2.0%) patients. After IPTW, amiodarone exposure was not significantly associated with ILD [hazard ratio (HR): 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.97, 2.44, P = 0.09]. There was a trivial higher relative risk of ILD among amiodarone-exposed patients between Years 2 and 8 of follow-up [maximal risk ratio (RR): 1.019]. Primary lung cancer occurred in 97 (0.8%) patients. After IPTW, amiodarone was not associated with PLC (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.76, 2.08, P = 0.53). All-cause death occurred in 2185 (18.1%) patients. After IPTW, amiodarone was associated with reduced mortality risk (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.72, P < 0.001). The results were consistent across a variety of sensitivity analyses. In a contemporary AF population, low-dose amiodarone was associated with a trend towards increased risk of ILD (15%-45%) but a clinically negligible change in absolute risk (maximum of 1.8%), no increased risk of PLC, and a lower risk of all-cause mortality.",

PubMed and Embase databases were searched for relevant articles from inception to June 10th 2022. Cohort studies on hypertension or blood pressure and heart failure were included. Random effect models were used to calculate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between hypertension or blood pressure and heart failure. Forty-seven cohort studies were included. The summary RR was 1.71 (95% Cl: 1.53-1.90, I2\u2009=\u200998.4%) for hypertension vs. no hypertension (n\u2009=\u200943 studies, 166798 cases, 20359997 participants), 1.28 (95% CI: 1.22-1.35, I2\u2009=\u200990.3%) per 20\u2005mmHg of systolic blood pressure (24 studies, 31639 cases and 2557975 participants) and 1.12 (95% CI: 1.04-1.21, I2\u2009=\u200992.6%) per 10\u2005mmHg of diastolic blood pressure (16 studies, 23127 cases and 2419972 participants). There was a steeper increase in heart failure risk at higher blood pressure levels and a 3-5 fold increase in RR at around 180/120\u2005mmHg of systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to 100/60\u2005mmHg, respectively. There was little indication of publication bias across analyses. This meta-analysis suggest a strong positive association between hypertension and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the risk of heart failure. These results supports efforts to reduce blood pressure in the general population to reduce the risk of heart failure. Hypertension is associated with a 71% increase in the risk of heart failure A 20\u2005mmHg increment in systolic blood pressure is associated with a 28% increment in heart failure risk and a 10\u2005mmHg increment in diastolic blood pressure is associated with a 12% increase in heart failure risk The results support public health policies and interventions to reduce the prevalence of elevated blood pressure (e.g. through lifestyle changes and medication use).",

CB-5083, a novel valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 inhibitor that disrupts proteasomal degradation and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) accumulation, was evaluated as an inducer of immunogenic cell death (ICD) in PDAC treatment. Furthermore, miR-142 enhances checkpoint blockade and promotes M1 repolarization, while Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist resiquimod (R) acts as an immunoadjuvant to amplify the immune response to miR-142. This research signifies the first integration of CB, miR-142, and R in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) modified with peptides targeting PD-L1, EGFR, and ER, which were shelled by the PEG-polyglutamic (PGA) coating that detaches in response to the acidic pH values in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The modified SLNs exhibited pH-sensitive cytotoxicity against Panc-02 cells, preserving normal cells and preventing hemolysis.

In this work, we developed a vision transformer-based (ViT-based) multi-label model with multi-modal input to learn complimentary information from available pretreatment data and predict multiple associated endpoints for OPC patient radiotherapy. In our study, a publicly available dataset of 512 OPC patients was utilized for both model training and evaluation. Planning CT images, primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) masks and 16 clinical variables representing patient demographic, diagnosis, and treatment were used as input. To extract deep image features with global attention, we utilized a ViT module. Clinical variables were concatenated with the learnt image features and fed to fully-connection layers to incorporate cross-modality features. To learn the mapping between the features and correlated survival outcomes, such as overall survival (OS), local failure-free survival (LFFS), regional failure-free survival (RFFS), and distant failure-free survival (DFFS), we employed four Multi-Task Logistic Regression (MTLR) layers. The proposed model was optimized by combining the MTLR negative-log likelihood losses of different prediction targets. We employed the C-index and AUC metrics to assess the performance of our model for time-to-event prediction and time-specific binary prediction, respectively.

        "AbstractText": "We investigated the incidences of overall and site-specific malignancies and chemopreventive effects of statin, metformin, and aspirin in patients with ulcerative colitis. We collected data using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment claims database from January 2007 to April 2020. The overall malignancy risk among the 35,189 ulcerative colitis patients was similar to that of the general population (standardized incidence ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.00). In male patients, standardized incidence ratios were high for thyroid cancer and low for stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer. Concurrently, standard incidence ratios were high for liver cancer and central nervous system cancer in female patients. While 122 cases of colorectal cancer occurred in the study patients, the standardized incidence ratio was 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.99). Treatment for ulcerative colitis was not associated with an increased adjusted hazard ratio, while comorbidities increased it for all malignancies. Treatment for ulcerative colitis was associated with an increased adjusted hazard ratio, while comorbidities did not increase it for colorectal cancer. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and ulcerative colitis treatment, statins showed a dose-dependent chemopreventive effect for all malignancies (P=0.002), while metformin and aspirin did not show any. In ulcerative colitis patients, standardized incidence ratios for all malignancies and colorectal cancer did not increase. Adjusted hazard ratios for all malignancies increased with comorbidities and those for colorectal cancer with ulcerative colitis treatment. Statins have a dose-dependent chemopreventive effect for all malignancies.",

        "AbstractText": "ARID1A is among the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we conduct a CRISPR-Cas9 synthetic lethality screen using ARID1A-deficient HCC cells to identify approaches to treat HCC patients harboring ARID1A deficiency. This strategy reveals that the survival of these ARID1A-deficient HCC cells is highly dependent on genes related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Mechanistically, ARID1A loss represses expression of key glycolysis-related gene PKM, shifting cellular glucose metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to dependence on the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Cuproptosis is a recently defined form of copper-induced cell death reported to directly target the TCA cycle. Here, we find that ARID1A-deficient HCC cells and xenograft tumors are highly sensitive to copper treatment. Together, these results offer evidence of the synthetic lethality between ARID1A deficiency and mitochondrial respiration impairment, suggesting that copper treatment constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for selectively targeting ARID1A-deficient HCC.",

        "AbstractText": "For studies using microbiome data, the ability to robustly combine data from technically and biologically distinct microbiome studies is a crucial means of supporting more robust and clinically relevant inferences. Formidable technical challenges arise when attempting to combine data from technically diverse 16S rRNA gene variable region amplicon sequencing (16S) studies. Closed operational taxonomic units and taxonomy are criticized as being heavily dependent upon reference sets and with limited precision relative to the underlying biology. Phylogenetic placement has been demonstrated to be a promising taxonomy-free manner of harmonizing microbiome data, but it has lacked a validated count-based feature suitable for use in machine learning and association studies. Here we introduce a phylogenetic-placement-based, taxonomy-independent, compositional feature of microbiota: phylotypes. Phylotypes were predictive of clinical outcomes such as obesity or pre-term birth on technically diverse independent validation sets harmonized post hoc. Thus, phylotypes enable the rigorous cross-validation of 16S-based clinical prognostic models and associative microbiome studies.",

Here, we identify N-[4-(1H46 pyrazolo[3,4-b] pyrazin-6-yl)-phenyl]-sulfonamide (Sanofi-14h), a compound with preference for inhibition of the AGC family kinase SGK3, as an inhibitor of Ifnb1 gene expression in response to STING stimulation of macrophages. Sanofi-14h abrogated SGK activity and also impaired activation of the critical TBK1/IRF3 pathway downstream of STING activation, blocking interaction of STING with TBK1. Deletion of SGK1/3 in a macrophage cell line did not block TBK1/IRF3 activation but decreased expression of transcription factors, such as IRF7 and STAT1, required for the innate immune response. Other AGC kinase inhibitors blocked TBK1 and IRF3 activation suggesting common action on a critical regulatory node in the STING pathway. These studies reveal both SGK-dependent and SGK-independent mechanisms in the innate immune response and indicate an approach to block aberrant Ifnb1 expression.",

A retrospective review of the electronic medical records of survivors of childhood ALL (n=230) was conducted. We analyzed the survivors' characteristics, including sex, age, weight status at diagnosis, central nervous system involvement, risk classification, length of treatment, radiation therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Analysis of variance and the chi-squared test were applied to investigate influencing factors. The weight status distribution was as follows: 23 individuals (10.0%) were classified as underweight, 151 individuals (65.7%) were healthy weight, and 56 individuals (24.3%) were overweight/obese. Age at diagnosis (F=10.03, p<.001), weight status at diagnosis (x2=43.41, p<.001), and risk classification (F=10.98, p=0.027) showed significant differences among the weight status groups. Survivors who were older at diagnosis and those in the very high-risk category had a higher likelihood of experiencing underweight status during their survivorship, while survivors who were overweight/obese at diagnosis were more likely to remain overweight/obese at the time of survival. Considering the potential health implications related to an unhealthy weight status in survivors of ALL, it is imperative to undertake early identification and implement interventions for at-risk individuals.",

This study aimed to evaluate the association between knee OA and mortality through propensity score matching. This was a cohort study including Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010-2013) participants aged \u2265 50 years. By linking the survey data to cause of death data (through 2019) from Statistics Korea, mortality and cause-specific mortality data were obtained. Radiographic knee OA (ROA) was defined as bilateral Kellgren-Lawrence grade \u2265 2. Propensity score matching (1:1) was conducted between asymptomatic ROA, knee pain, and symptomatic ROA groups and normal groups, balancing the confounding factors. Time to death was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard modeling. A higher CVD mortality was observed in the symptomatic ROA group, but not in others; the risk estimates were asymptomatic ROA (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-1.65), knee pain (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.27-1.38), and symptomatic ROA (HR 1.39; 95% CI 0.89-2.17). No association was found between the all-cause/cancer mortality and other groups. When propensity score matching controls metabolic risk factor imbalances, the association between symptomatic knee OA and higher CVD mortality was weaker compared to results of prior studies that used regression adjustment. The results may be more precise estimates of the total risk of knee OA for mortality in Koreans.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate risk factors for metachronous recurrence of endoscopically resected gastric cancer. We searched medical literature published by February 2023 and identified patients with MGC after endoscopic resection for gastric cancer. The occurrence of MGC and the presence of intestinal metaplasia (IM), severe atrophic gastritis (AG), and H. pylori infection were quantitatively analyzed. We identified 2,755 patients from nine cohort studies who underwent endoscopic resection for gastric cancer by 2018. Those with severe AG or presence of IM had a significantly higher incidence of MGC than those without (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.35-2.98, I2 = 52% for severe atrophy on antrum; RR 7.08, 95% CI 3.63-13.80, I2 = 0% for antral IM). Absolute risk difference of MGC occurrence was 7.1% in those with severe AG and 9.2% in those with IM. The difference in incidence rate per 1,000 person-years was 17.5 person-years for those with severe AG and 24.7 person-years for those with IM. However, H. pylori eradication did not significantly affect the occurrence of MGC (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.88-1.59, I2 = 10%). Gastric cancer patients with severe AG or presence of IM had a 2.0-fold or 7.0-fold higher risk of MGC occurrence after endoscopic resection than those without, respectively.

The malignant clones produce cytokines that drive self-perpetuating inflammatory responses and tend to transform into more aggressive clones, leading to disease progression. The progression of MPNs follows a biological sequence from the early phases of malignancy, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia, to advanced myelofibrosis and leukemic transformation. To date, the treatment of MPNs has focused on preventing thrombosis by decreasing blood cell counts and relieving disease-related symptoms. However, interferon (IFN) has been used to treat MPNs because of its ability to attack cancer cells directly and modulate the immune system. IFN also has the potential to modulate diseases by inhibiting JAK2 mutations, and recent studies have demonstrated clinical and molecular improvements. Long-acting IFN is administered less frequently and has fewer adverse effects than conventional IFN. The current state of research on long-acting IFN in patients with MPNs is discussed, along with future directions.",

In this study, we found that F2 (the gene encoding thrombin) was strongly upregulated in breast cancer (BRCA, TCGA Study Abbreviations) compared with normal samples and that lower F2 levels were associated with poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. Thrombin induces ferroptosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells by activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2\u03b1 (cPLA2\u03b1) activity to increase the release of arachidonic acid (AA). TNBC in all breast cancer subtypes exhibited the highest levels of PLA2G4A (the gene encoding cPLA2\u03b1) and Acsl4, and inhibition of cPLA2\u03b1 and its downstream enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) reversed thrombin toxicity.

Nevertheless, its function in gastric cancer is not completely clear. Hereby, we investigated the function and prognostic value of Fam198b in gastric cancer and further validated the results in gastric cancer through a series of in vitro experiments. We used R software and online bioinformatics analysis tools-GEPIA2, TIMER2, Kaplan-Meier plotter, cBioPortal, TISIDB COSMIC, and STRING to study the characteristics and functions of Fam198b in GC, such as aberrant expression, prognostic value, genomic alterations, immune microenvironment, anticancer drug sensitivity, and related signaling pathways. In addition, in vitro experiments such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), cell function experiments, and signaling pathway experiments were performed to validate the key conclusions. Fam198b is obviously highly expressed in gastric cancer, and its expression is intensively correlated with tumor prognosis. The etiology of abnormal Fam198b expression was superficially investigated and validated by associating genomic alterations and the immune microenvironment. Furthermore, Fam198b is intensively correlated with the sensitivity of multiple antitumor drugs. It was demonstrated by functional enrichment analysis that Fam198b was linked to myogenesis, angiogenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transition and cytokine binding. It was observed in vitro experiments that knockdown Fam198b could significantly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and migration. These results were reversed when Fam198b was overexpressed. It was validated by signaling pathway experiments that Fam198b promoted gastric cancer progression by up-regulating the PI3K/AKT/BCL-2 signaling pathway. As a novel biomarker to predict GC prognosis and tumor progression, Fam198b is a promising therapeutic target to reverse tumor progression.",

Patients aged \u226570\u00a0years, with a Geriatric-8 score of \u226414, initiating palliative oncological treatment were enrolled in an open label randomized controlled trial and randomized 1:1 to receive either CGA-guided interventions in addition to oncological standard care or oncological care alone. Baseline characteristics, physical performance measures, and QoL questionnaires were retrieved before group allocation. CGA was performed using a fixed set of domains and validated tests by a geriatrician-led team. The primary endpoint, physical performance, was measured by the 30-s chair stand test (30s-CST) at three months. Additional outcomes included 30s-CST at six months, handgrip strength test, and QoL. Outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed regression models. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.org (NCT04686851). From November 1, 2020 to May 31, 2022, 181 patients were included; 88 in the interventional arm and 93 in the control arm. Median age was 77 (interquartile range [IQR] 73-81) years, 69% were male, median Geriatric-8 score was 12 (IQR 10-13), 69% had a Performance Status of 0-1, and the median 30s-CST was 9 (IQR 5-11) repetitions.

Optimal implementation is crucial to improve pre-operative classification of ovarian tumors, which may lead to better patient referral to the appropriate level of care. In February 2021, an electronic questionnaire consisting of 37 questions was sent to all 72 hospitals in the Netherlands. One pre-selected gynaecologist per hospital was asked to respond on behalf of the department. The study had a response rate of 93% (67/72 hospitals). All respondents (100%) were familiar with the IOTA models with 94% using them in practice. The logistic regression 2 (LR2)-model, Simple ultrasound-based rules (SR) and Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model were used in respectively 40%, 67% and 73% of these hospitals. Respondents rated the models overall with an 8.2 (SD 1.8), 8.3 (SD 1.6) and 8.9 (SD 1.3) respectively for LR2, SR and ADNEX on a scale from 1 to 10. Moreover, 89% indicated to have confidence in the results of the IOTA models. The most important factors to improve further implementation are more training (43%), research on sensitivity, specificity and cost-effectiveness in the Dutch health care system (27%), easier usability (24%) and more consultation time (19%). The IOTA ultrasound models are adopted in the majority of Dutch hospitals with the ADNEX model being used the most. While Dutch gynecologists have a strong familiarity and confidence in the models, the uptake varies in reality.

Through whole exome sequencing of CCA cell lines, KKU-213A and KKU-100, we identified mutations in common driver genes and predicted corresponding HLA-restricted peptides. Peptides from KRAS, RNF43, and TP53 mutations exhibited strong binding affinity to HLA-A11, as validated through molecular docking and T2-cell binding assays. Dendritic cells (DCs) from healthy donors expressing HLA-A*\u00a011:01, pulsed with individual or pooled peptides, showed comparable levels of costimulatory molecules (CD11c, CD40, CD86, and HLA-DR) to conventional DCs but higher expression of maturation markers, CD80 and CD86. Autologous HLA-A*\u00a011:01-restricted T cells, activated by peptide-pulsed DCs, effectively lysed KKU-213A (HLA-A*11:01) cells, outperforming conventional tumor lysate-pulsed DCs.

This study investigated the underlying mechanisms of HP against CRC using network pharmacology analysis and in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results revealed nine bioactive compounds of HP. Furthermore, 3460 CRC-related targets of the identified active compounds were predicted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Furthermore, 65 common targets were identified through the intersection of two related targets. Moreover, ten hub genes, including CDK4, CDK2, CDK1, CCND1, CCNB1, CCNA2, MYC, E2F1, CHEK1, and CDKN1A were identified through the topological analysis. Meanwhile, the GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the core target genes were majorly enriched in the p53 and HIF-1 signaling pathways. Moreover, HP promoted apoptosis and suppressed cell proliferation by activating the p53 signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner, while a similar effect was observed for Isovitexin (the primary component of HP). Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of HP and its component Isovitexin against CRC, providing a theoretical foundation for additional experimental verification of its clinical application.",

In all subgroups, the AUCs of the KS (median\u00a0=\u00a00.91) were higher than those of the GS (median\u00a0=\u00a00.83). Except for \"premenopausal patients\" (p\u00a0=\u00a00.057), these differences were statistically significant (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). Kappa agreement was higher for the KS (0.922) than for the GS (0.358). Both the KS and the GS provided added value for the management of enhancing lesions on breast MRI. The KS was superior to the GS in terms of avoiding unnecessary biopsies and showed superior inter-reader agreement; therefore, it may be regarded as the clinical decision rule of choice.",

Nine patients with anterior disc displacement without reduction (ADDWoR, 15 sides) who underwent arthroscopic disc repositioning surgery were included. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the articular disc and the condyle in the closed-mouth position was performed using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Then, the CBCT and MRI images were fused and displayed together by multimodal image registration techniques. Morphological changes in the articular disc and condyle, as well as changes in their spatial relationship, were studied by comparing preoperative and 3-month postoperative CBCT-MRI fused images. The volume and superficial area of the articular disc, as well as the area of the articular disc surface in the subarticular cavity, were significantly increased compared to that before the surgical treatment\uff08P\u00a0<\u00a00.01\uff09. There was also a significant increase in the volume of the condyle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). All condyles showed bone remodeling after surgery that could be categorized as one of two types depending on the position of the articular disc, suggesting that the location of the articular disc was related to the new bone formation. The morphology of the articular disc and condyle were significantly changed after arthroscopic disc repositioning surgery. The 3D changes in the position of the articular disc after surgery tended to have an effect on condylar bone remodeling and the location of new bone formation.",

Sixty-one patients underwent radical hysterectomy (RH), and 95 patients underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Clinical and MR parameters of primary tumours were analysed. A 1:1 ratio propensity score matching (PSM) was performed for the RH group and CCRT group according to T stage. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the associations between imaging or clinical variables and PFS and OS. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 72.6% and 78.3%, respectively.

This study investigated the differences in background factors between ML and other malignancies that occur in RA patients and post-malignancy treatment. We identified 935 RA patients with new-onset malignancies among 110,571 person-years registered in the National Database of Rheumatic Disease in Japan from 2012 to 2018. Analysis cohorts 1 and 2 included 597 and 490 patients with available data for 1 year before and after the development of malignancies, respectively. Factors associated with the development of ML were longitudinally evaluated by multiple logistic regression analyses. Of the 935 patients (mean age 70.5, standard deviation 9.9), 15.5% had ML; this was comparable to the rate of lung cancer (14.3%). In cohort 1, methotrexate (MTX), biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used in 74.4%, 23.4%, and 56.7% of ML and in 56.8%, 25.4%, and 35.3% of other malignancies 1 year before the occurrence of malignancies. Clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and C-reactive protein were similar between the two groups. Multivariable analysis showed that MTX use (odds ratio [OR]: 2.22, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.32-3.73, p=0.003) and NSAID use (OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.58-3.98, p <0.001) were significantly associated with the development of ML versus other malignancies. However, this association was not observed with bDMARDs. In cohort 2, one year after the development of malignancies, MTX was used in none of ML and 41.8% of patients who developed other malignancies. In both malignancy groups, approximately 15% of patients received bDMARDs and 50% received glucocorticoids. IL-6 inhibitors were preferentially prescribed in patients with ML versus those with other malignancies. At year 1, CDAI remission was achieved in 37.3% and 31.1% of patients in the ML and other malignancy groups, respectively. Patients receiving long-term treatment with MTX and NSAIDs may be at a relatively high risk of developing ML. The treatment landscape after developing malignancies differed considerably between patients with ML and other malignancies, and different treatment strategies should be established.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of redo thoracoscopic resections for ipsilateral pulmonary malignancy. Data from patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery at the Unit of Thoracic Surgery of Padua were analyzed, comparing the results between the first and second ipsilateral surgery. The retrospective study included patients who underwent 2 thoracoscopic surgeries for oncological reasons between 2015 and 2022. The variables considered included patients' baseline characteristics, pre, intra, and postoperative data. The study enrolled 51 patients undergoing ipsilateral thoracoscopic re-operation.

In this report, we describe a case of MTS with severe occlusion of the left common iliac vein in the context of a previously undiagnosed pancreatic cancer. We detail the endovascular resolution of the iliac vein compression and show long-term patency. A 33-year-old woman on oral contraceptive pills presented with extensive thrombosis of the left common iliac vein extending cephalad into the lower IVC and inferiorly to the femoral vein. The thrombus was refractory to therapeutic heparin. Mechanical thrombectomy removed the occluding thrombus. Intravenous ultrasound identified severe compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. Angioplasty and stenting provided complete resolution of the lesion. Imaging and hematologic workup revealed a pancreatic malignancy and concomitant hypercoagulable state that likely precipitated the patient's presentation. Endovascular intervention provided complete resolution of severe iliac vein compression. Patency was maintained at 6-month follow-up. Research suggests that the anatomical lesion predisposing individuals to MTS is relatively common despite infrequent occurrence of the syndrome. This case highlights the importance of a high clinical suspicion for associated hypercoagulable states when MTS is discovered. There is limited research exploring the relationship between severity of iliac vein compression and endovascular treatment outcome. This case documents endovascular resolution of a severe lesion with maintained patency.",

However, the signaling pathways that play a role in HNSCC CSC maintenance and therapy response are not well-understood. In this study, we investigate the response of CSCs to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) modulation and its potential dependency on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. PTEN deficiency was stably induced using short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Downregulation of RPTOR/mTORC1 and RICTOR/mTORC2 was achieved using small interfering RNA (siRNA). CSCs were evaluated through tumorsphere formation and were classified into various subtypes: parasphere, merosphere, and holosphere. We investigated the effect of rapamycin on CSC properties in both control and PTEN-deficient HNSCC cells. PTEN deficiency led to an accumulation of CSCs and enhanced a favorable response to rapamycin treatment. The viability of HNSCC CSCs was dependent on mTOR signaling. Deficiencies in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 reduced the number of CSCs. However, CSCs with PTEN deficiency had a greater reliance on mTORC1 signaling. Interestingly, when considering CSC subtypes, a deficiency in mTORC2 led to an increased number of paraspheres in both the control and PTEN-deficient groups. Loss of PTEN signaling increased the HNSCC CSC population, which can be targeted by rapamycin. However, the mTORC2 deficiency can induce a problematic selection of paraspheres CSCs subtype.",

However, the exact actions and mechanisms of HP-\u03b2-CD on TNBC are not fully understood. To examine the influence of HP-\u03b2-CD on the proliferation and migration of TNBC cell lines, particularly 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, a range of assays, including MTT, scratch, cell cycle, and clonal formation assays, were performed. Furthermore, the effectiveness of HP-\u03b2-CD in the treatment of TNBC was assessed in vivo using a 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mouse model. We demonstrated the anti-proliferation and anti-migration effect of HP-\u03b2-CD on TNBC both in vitro and in vivo. High cholesterol diet can attenuate HP-\u03b2-CD-inhibited TNBC growth. Mechanistically, HP-\u03b2-CD reduced tumor cholesterol levels by increasing ABCA1 and ABCG1-mediated cholesterol reverse transport.

In our review, we critically discuss the advancements in understanding the roles of RCS-induced protein/DNA modifications in signaling switches to provide adaptive cell response under physiological and oxidative stress conditions. At non-toxic concentrations, RCS modify susceptible Cys residue in c-Src to activate MAPK signaling and Cys, Lys, and His residues in PTEN to cause its reversible inactivation, thereby stimulating PI3K/PKB(Akt) pathway. RCS toxic concentrations cause irreversible Cys modifications in Keap1 and IKK\u03b2 followed by stabilization of Nrf2 and activation of NF-\u03baB, respectively, for their nuclear translocation and antioxidant gene expression.

Histological parameters such as a solid or micropapillary growth pattern are well-described risk factors for recurrence. However, not every patient presenting with such a pattern will develop recurrence. Designing a model which can more accurately predict recurrence on small biopsy samples can aid the stratification of patients for surgery, (neo-)adjuvant therapy, and follow-up. In this study, a statistical model on biopsies fed with histological data from early and advanced-stage lung adenocarcinomas was developed to predict recurrence after surgical resection. Additionally, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based artificial intelligence (AI) classification model, named AI-based Lung Adenocarcinoma Recurrence Predictor (AILARP), was trained to predict recurrence, with an ImageNet pre-trained EfficientNet that was fine-tuned on lung adenocarcinoma biopsies using transfer learning. Both models were validated using the same biopsy dataset to ensure that an accurate comparison was demonstrated. The statistical model had an accuracy of 0.49 for all patients when using histology data only. The AI classification model yielded a test accuracy of 0.70 and 0.82 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74 and 0.87 on patch-wise and patient-wise hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs), respectively. AI classification outperformed the traditional clinical approach for recurrence prediction on biopsies by a fair margin.

A recent study by the authors that used sniffer dogs to detect differences in saliva from dogs diagnosed with various neoplastic processes compared with healthy control dogs is described. The concept of One Health is explored by the description of previous studies that have utilized sniffer dogs in the detection of human neoplasia (focusing on lung, prostate, and breast cancer) and veterinary neoplasia and demonstrating that further research in this arena can benefit multiple species. Future avenues of research and utilization of these findings are outlined. The companion Currents in One Health by Ungar et al, JAVMA, January 2024, addresses the use of sniffer dogs to detect human COVID-19 infections.",

        "AbstractText": "To investigate the feasibility of dose painting by numbers (DPBN) with respect to robustness for proton therapy for head and neck cancers (HNC), and to study the influence of variable RBE on the TCP and OAR dose burden. Data for 19 patients who have been scanned pretreatment with PET-FDG and subsequently treated with photon therapy were used in the study. A dose response model developed for photon therapy was implemented in a TPS, allowing DPBN plans to be created. Conventional homogeneous dose and DPBN plans were created for each patient, optimized with either fixed RBE\u00a0=\u00a01.1 or a variable RBE model. Robust optimization was used to create clinically acceptable plans. To estimate the maximum potential loss in TCP due to actual SUV variations from the pre-treatment imaging, we applied a test case with randomized SUV distribution. Regardless of the use of variable RBE for optimization or evaluation, a statistically significant increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in TCP was found for DPBN plans as compared to homogeneous dose plans. Randomizing the SUV distribution decreased the TCP for all plans. A correlation between TCP increase and variance of the SUV distribution and target volume was also found. DPBN for protons and HNC is feasible and could lead to a TCP gain. Risks associated with the temporal variation of SUV distributions could be mitigated by imposing minimum doses to targets. The correlation found between TCP increase and SUV variance and target volume may be used for patient selection.",

        "AbstractText": "Non-coding RNAs have shown key roles in cancer and among them, short RNA molecules are known as microRNAs (miRNAs). These molecules have length less than 25 nucleotides and suppress translation and expression. The functional miRNAs are produced in cytoplasm. Lung cancer is a devastating disease that its mortality and morbidity have undergone an increase in recent years. Aggressive behavior leads to undesirable prognosis and tumors demonstrate abnormal proliferation and invasion. In the present review, miRNA functions in lung cancer is described. miRNAs reduce/increase proliferation and metastasis. They modulate cell death and proliferation. Overexpression of oncogenic miRNAs facilitates drug resistance and radio-resistance in lung cancer. Tumor microenvironment components including macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts demonstrate interactions with miRNAs in lung cancer. Other factors such as HIF-1\u03b1, lncRNAs and circRNAs modulate miRNA expression. miRNAs have also value in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Understanding such interactions can pave the way for developing novel therapeutics in near future for lung cancer patients.",

Abnormal expression of VGSCs has been observed in various types of tumors, while they are either not expressed or expressed at a low level in the matching normal tissue. Hence, this abnormal expression suggests that VGSCs confer some advantage or viability on tumor cells, making them a valuable indicator for identifying tumor cells. In addition, overexpression of VGSCs increased the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and invade, as well as correlated with the metastatic behavior of different cancers. Therefore, blocking VGSCs presents a new strategy for the treatment of cancers. A portion of this review summarizes the structure and function of VGSCs and also describes the correlation between VGSCs and cancers. Most importantly, we provide an overview of current research on various subtype-selective VGSC inhibitors and updates on ongoing clinical studies.",

The recent, increased, numbers of individuals referred for counseling and multigene panel testing, and the remarkable expansion of approved PARPis, not restricted to BRCA1/BRCA2-Pathogenic Variants (PVs), produced a strong clinical need for non-BRCA biomarkers. Significant limitations of the current testing and assays exist. The different approaches that identify the causes of Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD), such as the germline and somatic Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) gene PVs, the testing showing its consequences, such as the genomic scars, or the novel functional assays such as the RAD51 foci testing, are not interchangeable, and should not be considered as substitutes for each other in clinical practice for guiding use of PARPi in non-BRCA, HRD-associated tumors. Today, the deeper knowledge on the significant relationship among all proteins involved in the HRR, not limited to BRCA, expands the possibility of a successful non-BRCA, HRD-PARPi synthetic lethality and, at the same time, reinforces the need for enhanced definition of HRD biomarkers predicting the magnitude of PARPi benefit.",

        "AbstractText": "Air pollution is a major threat to human health and ecosystems. Using 10-year (2013-2022) multi-source observations for the Beijing, China, we showed that clean-air actions have significantly reduced PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and SO2 pollution, with an increase in the surface maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8O3) concentrations during autumn and winter, leading to a rapid diminishment of the urban-suburban gap in air pollution. Secondary sources and vehicle emissions were enhanced in both urban and suburban areas in all seasons except summer from 2013 to 2022. By combining statistical analysis with the convergent cross-mapping model, the varying relationships between air pollution and meteorological conditions in the urban and suburban areas were delineated. The results suggested that boundary layer height and relative humidity exerted strong and stable influences on all air pollutants, except for MDA8O3, whose key meteorological driver was temperature. This study showed that increasing O3 trends in autumn and winter and aggravated O3 formation in summer in urban areas in Beijing became non-negligible from 2013 to 2022, despite the declining levels of air pollutants. Meteorological observations suggested that weather patterns in Beijing, characterized by higher temperatures, sunshine hours, and boundary layer height and lower relative humidity, have become more favorable for O3 formation in autumn and winter. Future mitigation efforts should focus on reducing VOC and NOx emissions to avoid further deterioration of O3 pollution under the frequent adverse meteorological conditions predicted under the background of global warming.",

        "AbstractText": "The pectoralis major (PM) is a broad muscle commonly divided into three regions, which contribute uniquely to shoulder stability and movement. The PM muscle regions likely respond differently to stretch, but this has never been shown in vivo. We used shear wave elastography to assess the stretch response of different PM muscle regions during shoulder abduction and external rotation in 20 healthy male participants. Participants' shoulder was passively rotated through their range of motion in 5.7\u00b0 increments and shear wave velocities (SWV) were obtained for each muscle region. A piece-wise model was fitted to the SWV-joint angle data, from which slack angle, slack stiffness and elasticity coefficient were determined. For shoulder abduction, we found that the sternocostal region had a significantly smaller slack angle (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) and greater slack stiffness (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) than the abdominal region, but there was no difference for elasticity coefficient (p\u00a0=\u00a00.074). For external rotation, only slack stiffness was greater for the sternocostal than the abdominal region (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with no differences found for slack angle (p\u00a0=\u00a00.18) and elasticity coefficient (p\u00a0=\u00a00.74). However, our data indicates that neither region was slack in this condition. These findings indicate that the sternocostal and abdominal regions respond differently to passive stretch, highlighting the PM's functional differentiation. This differentiation should be considered during treatment interventions such as PM muscle harvesting or treatments for breast cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Xanthones are among the most fundamental phytochemicals in nature. The anti-cancer activities of xanthones and their derivatives have been extensively studied. Recently, we found that garcinone E (GE), an effective anti-cancer phytochemical isolated from mangosteen (Garcinia mangostanal.), showed promising anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. However, little is known about its effects on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) activity. This study aimed to identify potent dual EGFR and VEGFR2 inhibitors from mangosteen-derived xanthones using structure-activity relationship analyses. The interaction of xanthones with EGFR and VEGFR2 was analyzed using molecular docking experiments. The kinase activities of EGFR and VEGFR2 were determined using bioluminescence assays. The rat aortic ring and Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays were used to evaluate blood vessel formation ex vivo and in vivo. A breast tumor-bearing nude mouse model was established to examine the anti-tumor effects of different xanthones. Molecular docking analysis showed that GE bound tightly to EGFR and VEGFR2, with binding energies of -9.73 and -9.56\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively. Kinase activity assessment showed that GE strongly inhibited both EGFR and VEGFR2 kinase activity, with IC50 values of 315.4 and 158.2\u00a0nM, respectively. Moreover, GE significantly abolished the EGF- and VEGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and VEGFR2, respectively. GE also showed strong inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth, endothelial cell migration, invasion, and tube formation. Ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis assays showed that GE dose-dependently suppressed blood vessel formation in the rat aorta, Matrigel plugs, and transgenic zebrafish embryos, with the lowest effective concentration of 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM. Furthermore, GE (2\u00a0mg/kg) strongly inhibited tumor growth and reduced tumor weight in MDA-MB-231 breast tumor-xenografted mice. GE significantly reduced microvessel density and downregulated the expression of VEGFR2, EGFR, and Ki67 in tumor tissues. The present study demonstrated that GE was the most potent dual inhibitor of EGFR and VEGFR2 among all xanthones tested. These findings may provide valuable information for the future development of novel and effective dual inhibitors of EGFR and VEGFR2.",

The air we exhale is a possible new source for biomarkers which can be tapped into by analysing the exhaled breath condensate (EBC). We analysed the EBC from patients with PE and controls to investigate if the EBC is a useful source for new diagnostic biomarkers of PE. We collected and analysed EBC samples from patients with suspected PE and controls matched on age and sex. Patients in whom PE was ruled out after diagnostic work-up were included in the control group to increase the sensitivity and generalizability of the identified markers. EBC samples were collected using an RTube\u2122. The protein composition of the EBCs were analysed using data dependent label-free quantitative nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. EBC samples from 28 patients with confirmed PE, and 49 controls were analysed. A total of 928 EBC proteins were identified in the 77 EBC samples. As expected, a low protein concentration was determined which resulted in many proteins with unmeasurable levels in several samples. The levels of HSPA5, PEBP1 and SFTPA2 were higher and levels of POF1B, EPPK1, PSMA4, ALDOA, and CFL1 were lower in PE compared with controls. In conclusion, the human EBC contained a variety of endogenous proteins and may be a source for new diagnostic markers of PE and other diseases.

        "AbstractText": "Ferroptosis-triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) is widely adopted to potentiate the body's antitumor immunity by catalyzing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy is greatly restricted by intracellular abundant glutathione (GSH) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a facile bottom-up method for solvent-free synthesis of ultrathin manganese (Mn)-based layered double hydroxide nanosheets with high loading efficiency for pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3/uMn-LDHs) is proposed to mutually reinforce the ferroptosis and systemic immunity. The introduction of manganese ions significantly contributes to GSH depletion and hydroxyl radical generation, which can be further enhanced by IFN\u03b3 delivery induced SLC7A11 downregulation. The ICD effect after cell ferroptosis cooperates with the intrinsic immunomodulatory property of IFN\u03b3/uMn-LDHs to facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the priming of T cells. IFN\u03b3 secretion from activated CD8+ T cells in turn involves cascade immunogenic ferroptosis, thus constructing a closed-loop therapy. Remarkably, potent abscopal effect is observed in the growth inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, the ultrathin Mn-based clay nanoplatform provides a simple approach for mutual regulation between ferroptosis and antitumor immune response, overcoming the obstacles of current cancer immunotherapy.

        "AbstractText": "Androgen signaling in prostate cancer cells involves multisite cysteine ADP-ribosylation of the androgen receptor (AR) by PARP7. The AR modification is read by ADP-ribosyl binding macrodomains in PARP9, but the reason that multiple cysteines are modified is unknown. Here, we use synthetic peptides to show that dual ADP-ribosylation of closely spaced cysteines mediates recognition by the DTX3L/PARP9 complex. Mono and dual ADP-ribosylated cysteine peptides were prepared using a novel solid-phase synthetic strategy utilizing a key, Boc-protected, ribofuranosylcysteine building block. This synthetic strategy allowed us to synthesize fluorescently labeled peptides containing a dual ADP-ribosylation motif. It was found that the DTX3L/PARP9 complex recognizes the dual ADP-ribosylated AR peptide (Kd = 80.5 nM) with significantly higher affinity than peptides with a single ADP-ribose. Moreover, oligomerization of the DTX3L/PARP9 complex proved crucial for ADP-ribosyl-peptide interaction since a deletion mutant of the complex that prevents its oligomer formation dramatically reduced peptide binding. Our data show that features of the substrate modification and the reader contribute to the efficiency of the interaction and imply that multivalent interactions are important for AR-DTX3L/PARP9 assembly.",

Individuals age 18-49 years racialized as non-Hispanic Black and White (self-identified) and newly diagnosed with CRC during 2004-2019 were selected from the National Cancer Database. Patients who received recommended care (staging, surgery, lymph node evaluation, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) were considered to have received guideline-concordant care.

(1) Location of care matters. There is survival benefit for AYAs treated either at a pediatric center or site with special status (eg, Children's Oncology Group, National Cancer Institute [NCI]-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center). (2) Socioeconomic status and insurance require further investigation. Medicaid expansion has had a moderate effect on AYA outcomes. The dependent care expansion benefit has come largely from improvements in coverage for younger populations whose parents have insurance, while some subgroups likely still face insurance gaps. (3) Clinical trial enrollment remains poor, but access may be improving. Numerous barriers and facilitators of clinical trial enrollment include those that are system level and patient level. NCI has established several initiatives over the past decade to improve enrollment, and newer collaboratives have recently brought together multidisciplinary US teams to increase clinical trial enrollment. (4) Effective AYA programs require provider and system flexibility and program reflection. With flexibility comes a need for metrics to assess program effectiveness in the context of the program model. Centers treating AYAs with cancer could submit a subset of metrics (appropriate to their program and/or services) to maintain their status; persistence would require an entity with staying power committed to overseeing the metrics and the system. Substantial clinical and biological advances are anticipated over the next 20 years that will benefit all patients with cancer. In parallel, it is crucial to prioritize research regarding access to health care and cancer care delivery; only with equitable access to care for AYAs can they, too, benefit from these advances.",

It can predict the clinical outcomes of PCa as early as the disease is diagnosed and then guide therapeutic schemes, such as active monitoring, standalone surgical intervention, or surgery supplemented with postoperative adjunctive therapy, thereby circumventing disease exacerbation and excessive treatment. Classifications based on clinicopathological features, such as prostate cancer-specific antigen, Gleason score, and TNM stage, are still the main risk stratification strategies and have played an essential role in standardized clinical decision-making. However, mounting evidence indicates that clinicopathological parameters in isolation fail to adequately capture the heterogeneity exhibited among distinct PCa patients, such as those sharing identical Gleason scores yet experiencing divergent prognoses. As a remedy, molecular classifications have been introduced. Currently, molecular studies have revealed the characteristic genomic alterations, epigenetic modulations, and tumour microenvironment associated with different types of PCa, which provide a chance for urologists to refine the PCa classification. In this context, numerous invaluable molecular classifications have been devised, employing disparate statistical methodologies and algorithmic approaches, encompassing self-organizing map clustering, unsupervised cluster analysis, and multifarious algorithms. Interestingly, the classifier PAM50 was used in a phase-2 multicentre open-label trial, NRG-GU-006, for further validation, which hints at the promise of molecular classification for clinical use. Consequently, this review examines the extant molecular classifications, delineates the prevailing panorama of clinically pertinent molecular signatures, and delves into eight emblematic molecular classifications, dissecting their methodological underpinnings and clinical utility.",

In patients with LARC who were treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy (NART), higher ZNF281 expression in malignant tissue was associated with a poorer prognosis and lesser degree of tumor regression. Cell and mouse experiments have shown that ZNF281 reduces the damage caused by X-rays to CRC cells and tumors grown in mice.

Circulating T8sen cells were characterized by a higher expression of SA-\u03b2gal and the transcription factor T-bet, confirming their senescent status. Using whole virome profiling, cytomegalovirus (CMV) was the only virus associated with T8sen. CMV was necessary but not sufficient to explain high accumulation of T8sen (T8senhigh status). In CMV+ patients, the proportion of T8sen cells increased with cancer progression. Last, CMV-induced T8senhigh phenotype but not CMV seropositivity itself was associated with worse progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy but not with chemotherapy. Overall, CMV is the unique viral driver of T8sen-driven resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies in patients with aNSCLC.",

        "AbstractText": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients (NDMM) has shown recurrent structural variant (SV) involvement in distinct regions of the genome (i.e. hotspots) and causing recurrent copy number alterations. Together with canonical immunoglobulin translocations, these SVs are recognized as \"recurrent SVs\". More than half SVs were not involved in recurrent events. The significance of these \"rare SVs\" has not been previously examined. In this study, we utilize 752 WGS and 591 RNA-seq data from NDMM patients to determine the role of rare SVs in myeloma pathogenesis. 94% of patients harbored at least one rare SV event. Rare SVs showed an SV-class specific enrichment within genes and superenhancers associated with outlier gene expression. Furthermore, known myeloma driver genes recurrently impacted by point mutations were dysregulated by rare SVs. Overall, we demonstrate the association of rare SVs with aberrant gene expression supporting a potential driver role in myeloma pathogenesis.",

This study utilized the data from a previous randomized controlled trial (FUGES-012 study) investigating ICG-guided laparoscopic radical gastrectomy performed between November 2018 and July 2019. The Objective Structured Assessments of Technical Skills (OSATS) scoring system was used to grade videos from the ICG and non-ICG groups. Patients with an OSATS score >29 were classified as the high-OSATS population, while those with an OSATS score \u226429 were classified as the low-OSATS population. A total of 258 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis: 129 in the ICG group and 129 in the non-ICG group. The OSATS score of the ICG group was higher than that of the non-ICG group (29.6 \u00b1 2.6 vs. 26.6 \u00b1 3.6; P<0.001). The ICG group underwent a significantly higher mean total number of lymph node dissections than the non-ICG group (50.5 \u00b1 15.9 vs. 42.0 \u00b1 10.3; adjusted P<0.001). The group assigned to ICG use, better OSATS (high-OSATS) scores were observed, which correlated with greater D2 lymph node retrieval (54.1\u00b115.0 vs. 47.2\u00b18.7; adjusted P=0.039). Finally, the ICG group had a lower rate of lymph node non-compliance than that of the non-ICG group (31.8% vs. 57.4%; P<0.001). By applying ICG fluorescence navigation technique, better OSATS scores were observed, which correlated with greater lymph node retrieval and lower lymph node non-compliance rate, as recommended for individualized laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.",

Understanding the association of intrinsic subtypes with survival outcomes could potentially guide treatment decisions. Here, we evaluated the association of intrinsic subtypes with OS in MONALEESA-2, -3, -7. Tumor samples from MONALEESA-2, -3, -7 underwent PAM50-based subtyping. The relationship between subtypes and OS was assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Multivariable models were adjusted for clinical prognostic factors. Overall, 990 tumors (among 2066 patients) from ribociclib (n=580) and placebo (n=410) arms were profiled. Subtype distribution was luminal A, 54.5%; luminal B, 28.0%; HER2E, 14.6%; basal-like, 2.8%; and was consistent across treatment arms. The luminal A subtype had the best OS outcomes in both arms, while basal-like had the worst. Patients with HER2E (HR, 0.60; P=.018), luminal B (HR, 0.69; P=.023), and luminal A (HR, 0.75; P=.021) subtypes derived OS benefit with ribociclib. Patients with basal-like subtype did not derive benefit from ribociclib (HR, 1.92; P=.137); however, patient numbers were small (n=28). The prognostic value of intrinsic subtypes for OS was confirmed in this pooled analysis of the MONALEESA trials (largest data set in HR+/HER2- ABC). While basal-like subtype did not benefit, a consistent OS benefit was observed with ribociclib added to ET across luminal and HER2E subtypes.",

        "AbstractText": "Although immunotherapy is the mainstay of therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), robust biomarkers of clinical response are lacking. The heterogeneity of clinical responses together with the limited value of radiographic response assessments to timely and accurately predict therapeutic effect -especially in the setting of stable disease- call for the development of molecularly-informed real-time minimally invasive approaches. In addition to capturing tumor regression, liquid biopsies may be informative in capturing immune-related adverse events (irAEs). We investigated longitudinal changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with metastatic NSCLC who received immunotherapy-based regimens. Using ctDNA targeted error-correction sequencing together with matched sequencing of white blood cells and tumor tissue, we tracked serial changes in cell-free tumor load (cfTL) and determined molecular response. Peripheral T-cell repertoire dynamics were serially assessed and evaluated together with plasma protein expression profiles. Molecular response, defined as complete clearance of cfTL, was significantly associated with progression-free (log-rank p=0.0003) and overall survival (log-rank p=0.01) and was particularly informative in capturing differential survival outcomes among patients with radiographically stable disease. For patients who developed irAEs, on-treatment peripheral blood T-cell repertoire reshaping, assessed by significant TCR clonotypic expansions and regressions, was identified on average 5 months prior to clinical diagnosis of an immune-related adverse event. Molecular responses assist with interpretation of heterogeneous clinical responses especially for patients with stable disease. Our complementary assessment of the peripheral tumor and immune compartments provides an approach for monitoring of clinical benefit and irAEs during immunotherapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Ecological interactions are fundamental at the cellular scale, addressing the possibility of a description of cellular systems that uses language and principles of ecology. In this work, we use a minimal ecological approach that encompasses growth, adaptation and survival of cell populations to model cell metabolisms and competition under energetic constraints. As a proof-of-concept, we apply this general formulation to study the dynamics of the onset of a specific blood cancer-called Multiple Myeloma. We show that a minimal model describing antagonist cell populations competing for limited resources, as regulated by microenvironmental factors and internal cellular structures, reproduces patterns of Multiple Myeloma evolution, due to the uncontrolled proliferation of cancerous plasma cells within the bone marrow. The model is characterized by a class of regime shifts to more dissipative states for selectively advantaged malignant plasma cells, reflecting a breakdown of self-regulation in the bone marrow. The transition times obtained from the simulations range from years to decades consistently with clinical observations of survival times of patients. This irreversible dynamical behavior represents a possible description of the incurable nature of myelomas based on the ecological interactions between plasma cells and the microenvironment, embedded in a larger complex system. The use of ATP equivalent energy units in defining stocks and flows is a key to constructing an ecological model which reproduces the onset of myelomas as transitions between states of a system which reflects the energetics of plasma cells. This work provides a basis to construct more complex models representing myelomas, which can be compared with model ecosystems.",

        "AbstractText": "Evidence suggests that MAPK pathway activation, as measured by ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK), predicts overall survival (OS) in recurrent glioblastoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. We aimed to validate these findings in independent cohorts. In a 24-patient clinical trial on recurrent glioblastoma and high-grade gliomas, we examined the link between p-ERK levels and overall survival (OS). Patients received intravenous nivolumab, followed by maximal safe resection and an intracerebral injection of either ipilimumab alone or combined with nivolumab. Bi-weekly adjuvant nivolumab was then administered up to five times (NCT03233152). Using REMARK criteria, we conducted independent analyses for p-ERK quantification and statistical evaluations. Additional comparative analysis included prior cohorts, totaling 65 patients. Cox proportional hazards models and meta-analysis were employed to assess p-ERK as a predictive biomarker post-immunotherapy. Lower median p-ERK+ cell density was observed compared to prior studies, likely due to tissue handling variances. Nonetheless, high p-ERK was associated with prolonged OS, particularly in IDH wild-type glioblastomas (P=0.036). Median OS for high and low p-ERK patients were 55.6 and 30 weeks, respectively. Multivariable analysis reinforced p-ERK's significance in survival prediction (P=0.011). Meta-analysis across three cohorts (n=65) supported the survival benefit of elevated tumor p-ERK levels (P=0.0424). This study strengthens the role of p-ERK as a predictive biomarker for OS in glioblastoma patients on immune checkpoint blockade.

We prospectively collected lymph samples from neck drains of 106 HPV (+) OPSCC patients, along with 67 matched plasma samples, 24 hours after surgery. PCR and next-generation sequencing were used to quantify cancer-associated cell-free HPV (cf-HPV) and tumor-informed variants in lymph and plasma. Next, lymph cf-HPV and variants were compared to TMN stage, extranodal extension (ENE), and composite definitions of high-risk pathology. We then created a machine learning model, informed by lymph MRD and clinicopathological features, to compare with progression-free survival (PFS). Postoperative lymph was enriched with cf-HPV compared to plasma (P < 0.0001) and correlated with pN2 stage (P = 0.003), ENE (P < 0.0001), and trial-defined pathological risk criteria (mean AUC = 0.78). Additionally, the lymph mutation number and variant allele frequency (VAF) were higher in pN2 ENE (+) necks than in pN1 ENE (+) (P = 0.03, P = 0.02) or pN0-N1 ENE (-) (P = 0.04, P = 0.03, respectively). The lymph MRD-informed risk model demonstrated inferior PFS in high-risk patients (AUC = 0.96, P < 0.0001).

Here we describe the crystal structure of yeast PUS1 bound to an RNA target that we identified as being a hot spot for PUS1-interaction within a model mRNA at 2.4 \u00c5 resolution. The enzyme recognizes and binds both strands in a helical RNA duplex, and thus guides the RNA containing the target uridine to the active site for subsequent modification of the transcript.

Moreover, we observed increased IR-Crizotinib localization to orthotopic mouse xenograft GBM tumors, which resulted in impaired tumor growth in vivo.

We present a case of a surgeon who demonstrated long-term survival after overcoming repeated surgical challenges for multiple pulmonary metastases from PC. CASE REPORT Twenty-six years ago, a 62-year-old man initially reported discomfort during urination. A prostate examination revealed mildly elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Six months later, PC was diagnosed, and a radical prostatectomy was performed, revealing moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma but no vessel infiltration. At 9 years after the operation, three 10-mm nodules were detected in the right lung. Then, surgical biopsy by wedge pulmonary resection revealed metastatic PC, and therefore, right lower lobectomy including all nodules was planned. Although postoperative maintenance with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists kept the low PSA levels for 3 years, other newly limited metastases were observed in the opposite left lung, necessitating more surgeries of partial left lung resection. Six years later, a third lung metastasis was detected, as well as mild increases in the tumor size and PSA level, and the patient died 26 years after the initial PC intervention because of malnutrition for 1 year after sustaining bone compression fractures due to a fall, and not due to PC progression. CONCLUSIONS Repeated surgical resections for slow-growing metastatic pulmonary PC was an alternative treatment that facilitated favorable survival and a good quality of life for 26 years in the present case.",

These effects can have a detrimental impact on patients' quality of life and ability to perform everyday tasks. This study aimed to explore the experience of living with CIPN prior to and while participating in a randomised study of acupuncture versus a control wait group. The study was nested within a randomised trial (n=120) with participants randomised to acupuncture or to control (wait list for acupuncture). Participants (n=23) volunteered to be interviewed either by telephone (n=20) or face to face (n=3). The audiotapes produced were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic approach. Four themes developed; these included daily life with CIPN, signs and symptoms, interacting with others and management of CIPN. Patients reported compromised dexterity and ability to safely carry out activities. They were often reliant on help and sought out information from others living with the condition. There were also concerns about the lack of effectiveness and the side-effects of medication prescribed. Participants were self-selecting volunteers across different cancer groups, but the information gathered could influence future study designs and increase understanding of the impact of CIPN on patients' lives.",

        "AbstractText": "PRMT1 plays a vital role in breast tumorigenesis; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Herein, we show that PRMT1 plays a critical role in RNA alternative splicing, with a preference for exon inclusion. PRMT1 methylome profiling identifies that PRMT1 methylates the splicing factor SRSF1, which is critical for SRSF1 phosphorylation, SRSF1 binding with RNA, and exon inclusion. In breast tumors, PRMT1 overexpression is associated with increased SRSF1 arginine methylation and aberrant exon inclusion, which are critical for breast cancer cell growth. In addition, we identify a selective PRMT1 inhibitor, iPRMT1, which potently inhibits PRMT1-mediated SRSF1 methylation, exon inclusion, and breast cancer cell growth. Combination treatment with iPRMT1 and inhibitors targeting SRSF1 phosphorylation exhibits an additive effect of suppressing breast cancer cell growth. In conclusion, our study dissects a mechanism underlying PRMT1-mediated RNA alternative splicing. Thus, PRMT1 has great potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain malignancy. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) have attracted interest for their potential as treatment targets. Here, we show that CD97 (ADGRE5) is the most promising aGPCR target in GBM, by virtue of its de novo expression compared to healthy brain tissue. CD97 knockdown or knockout significantly reduces the tumor initiation capacity of patient-derived GBM cultures (PDGCs) in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. We find that CD97 promotes glycolytic metabolism via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which depends on phosphorylation of its C terminus and recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin. We also demonstrate that THY1/CD90 is a likely CD97 ligand in GBM. Lastly, we show that an anti-CD97 antibody-drug conjugate selectively kills tumor cells in\u00a0vitro. Our studies identify CD97 as a regulator of tumor metabolism, elucidate mechanisms of receptor activation and signaling, and provide strong scientific rationale for developing biologics to target it therapeutically in GBM.",

We identify 56 senescence-associated modules, many enriched in CAD GWAS genes and correlated with cardiometabolic traits-which supports universality of senescence gene programs across tissues and in CAD. Cross-tissue network analyses reveal 86 candidate senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, including COL6A3. Experimental knockdown of COL6A3 induces transcriptional changes that overlap the majority of the experimental senescence models, with cell-cycle arrest linked to modulation of DREAM complex-targeted genes. We provide a transcriptomic resource for cellular senescence and identify candidate biomarkers, SASP factors, and potential drivers of senescence in human tissues.",

However, the underlying mechanism of high FGL1 protein level in cancers is not well defined. Here, we report that FBXO38 interacts with and ubiquitylates FGL1 to negatively regulate its stability and to mediate cancer immune response. Depletion of FBXO38 markedly augments FGL1 abundance, not only suppressing CD8+ T\u00a0cell infiltration and enhancing immune evasion of tumor but also increasing inflammation in mice. Importantly, we observe a negative correlation of FBXO38 with FGL1 and IL-6 in non-small cell lung cancer specimens. FGL1 and IL-6 levels positively correlate with TNM (tumor, lymph node, metastasis) stages, while FBXO38 and the infiltrating CD8+ T\u00a0cells negatively correlate with TNM stages.

HRadNet fuses multilayer features with the metadata of images to take advantage of conventional radiomics methods and general convolutional neural networks. A two-stage training mechanism is adopted to improve the generalization capability of the network for multicenter breast cancer data. The ablation study shows the effectiveness of each component of HRadNet. Furthermore, the influence of features from different layers and metadata fusion are also analyzed. It reveals that selecting certain layers of features for a specified domain can make further performance improvements. Experimental results on three data sets from different devices demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network.

Rosacea and cancer are thought to be linked by the commonality of inflammatory and immune response dysfunction. Studies that have looked into this possible association have reported mixed results. Given the conflicting literature on this topic, our study sought to evaluate the overall association between rosacea and several cancers commonly investigated in the literature. A systematic review was conducted using the Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, and Ovid databases. Studies were screened independently for inclusion of rosacea and glioma and breast, thyroid, hepatic, or skin cancers. Using information from the articles, rosacea and each cancer were categorized as having a positive, negative, or unclear association. Our systematic review included 39 full-text studies that investigated the association between rosacea and various malignancies. Among the malignancies of concern, 41% (16/39) of the studies reported an association with basal cell carcinoma, with 2 cohorts revealing an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 1.50 (95% CI 1.35-1.67) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.56-0.93). In total, 33% (13/39) of the studies reported an association with squamous cell carcinoma, with 2 cohorts revealing an adjusted RR of 1.4 (95% CI 1.02-1.93) and 1.30 (95% CI 0.90-1.88). A total of 8% (3/39) of the studies reported an association between breast cancer and melanoma, with breast cancer cohorts revealing an adjusted RR of 8.453 (95% CI 1.638-43.606), 1.03 (95% CI 0.89-1.20), and 1.36 (95% CI 1.18-1.58) and melanoma cohorts revealing an adjusted RR of 1.10 (95% CI 0.95-1.27), 0.63 (95% CI 0.47-0.85), and 0.96 (95% CI 0.57-1.62).

Only 1 cohort reported an association with glioma, revealing an adjusted RR of 1.36 (95% CI 1.18-1.58). According to our review, patients with rosacea were statistically more likely to have nonmelanoma skin cancers, breast cancer, and glioma. Rosacea was not found to be substantially associated with melanoma. The associations between rosacea and hepatic and thyroid cancers were unclear because of conflicting results. The current literature shows that rosacea is significantly associated with increased odds of nonmelanoma skin cancers, glioma, and breast cancer.

However, information on premenopausal patients remains insufficient. To examine long-term survival outcomes of ILC and IDC in premenopausal patients using national databases. This cohort study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), Korean Breast Cancer Registry (KBCR), and Asan Medical Center Research (AMCR) databases to identify premenopausal patients with stage I to III ILC or IDC between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2015. The median follow-up time was 90 (IQR, 40-151) months in the SEER database, 94 (IQR, 65-131) months in the KBCR database, and 120 (IQR, 86-164) months in the AMCR database. Data were analyzed from January 1 to May 31, 2023. The primary outcome was breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), which was analyzed according to histological type, and the annual hazard rate was evaluated. Survival rates were analyzed using a log-rank test and a Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-varying coefficients. Multivariable analysis was performed by adjusting for tumor characteristics and treatment factors. A total of 225\u202f938 women diagnosed with IDC or ILC and younger than 50 years were identified. Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 42.7\u2009(5.3) years in the SEER database, 41.8\u2009(5.5) years in the KBCR database, and 41.8\u2009(5.5) years in the AMCR database. In terms of race (available for the SEER database only), 12.4% of patients were Black, 76.1% were White, 11.0% were of other race (including American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander), and 0.5% were of unknown race). Patients with ILC had better BCSS in the first 10 years after diagnosis than those with IDC (hazard ratios [HRs], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.68-0.78] in the SEER database, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.91-1.58] in the KBCR database, and 0.50 [95% CI, 0.29-0.86] in the AMCR database), although BCSS was worse after year 10 (HRs, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.59-2.02] in the SEER database, 2.79 [95% CI, 1.32-5.88] in the KBCR database, and 2.23 [95% CI, 1.04-4.79] in the AMCR database). Similar trends were observed for hormone receptor-positive tumors (HRs, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.37-1.75] in the SEER database, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.01-5.10] in the KBCR database, and 2.12 [95% CI, 0.98-4.60] in the AMCR database). Considering the annual hazard model of BCSS, IDC events tended to decline steadily after peaking 5 years before diagnosis. However, the annual peak event of BCSS was observed 5 years after diagnosis for ILC, which subsequently remained constant. These findings suggest that premenopausal women with ILC have worse BCSS estimates than those with IDC, which can be attributed to a higher late recurrence rate of ILC than that of IDC. Histological subtypes should be considered when determining the type and duration of endocrine therapy in premenopausal women.",

To examine the association between CHIP and CVD in patients with MM and to describe modifiers of CVD risk among those with CHIP. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with MM who underwent HCT between 2010 and 2016 at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California, and had pre-HCT mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) products cryopreserved and accessible for CHIP analyses. The study team performed targeted panel DNA sequencing to detect the presence of CHIP (variant allele frequency 2% or more). The primary end point was the 5-year cumulative incidence and risk for developing de novo CVD (heart failure, coronary artery disease, or stroke) after HCT. Of 1036 consecutive patients with MM (580 male [56%]; median age, 60.0 years) who underwent a first autologous HCT, 201 patients had at least 1 CHIP variant (19.4%) and 35 patients had 2 or more variants (3.4%). The 5-year incidence of CVD was significantly higher in patients with CHIP (21.1% vs 8.4%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with those without CHIP; the 5-year incidence among those with 2 or more variants was 25.6%. In the multivariable model, CHIP was associated with increased risk of CVD (hazard ratio [HR], 2.72; 95% CI, 1.70-4.39), as well as of individual outcomes of interest, including heart failure (HR, 4.02; 95% CI, 2.32-6.98), coronary artery disease (HR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.06-4.63), and stroke (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.07-8.52). Patients who had both CHIP and preexisting hypertension or dyslipidemia were at nearly 7-fold and 4-fold increased risk of CVD, respectively (reference: no CHIP, no hypertension, or dyslipidemia). CHIP was significantly and independently associated with risk of CVD in patients with MM undergoing HCT and may serve as a novel biologically plausible biomarker for CVD in this cohort. Patients with MM and both CHIP and cardiovascular risk factors had an exceptionally high risk of CVD.

Cox regression analysis was conducted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the incidence of biliary cancer, with adjustments made for confounding factors. A restricted cubic spline model was employed to examine the dose-response relationship. Additionally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate potential interactions and test the model's robustness. During 8.9 years and 872,645.3 person-years of follow-up, 95 cases of biliary cancer were observed. The incidence rate of biliary cancer in this study was 11 cases per 100,000 person-years.

Recently, the clinically vital but also highly renal-toxic small-molecule natural product amphotericin B was instead found to kill fungi primarily by forming extramembraneous sponge-like aggregates that extract ergosterol from lipid bilayers2-6. Here we show that rapid and selective extraction of fungal ergosterol can yield potent and renal-sparing polyene antifungals. Cholesterol extraction was found to drive the toxicity of amphotericin B to human renal cells. Our examination of high-resolution structures of amphotericin\u2009B sponges in sterol-free and sterol-bound states guided us to a promising structural derivative that does not bind cholesterol and is thus renal sparing. This derivative was also less potent because it extracts ergosterol more slowly. Selective acceleration of ergosterol extraction with a second structural modification yielded a new polyene, AM-2-19, that is renal sparing in mice and primary human renal cells, potent against hundreds of pathogenic fungal strains, resistance evasive following serial passage in vitro and highly efficacious in animal models of invasive fungal infections. Thus, rational tuning of the dynamics of interactions between small molecules may lead to better treatments for fungal infections that still kill millions of people annually7,8 and potentially other resistance-evasive antimicrobials, including those that have recently been shown to operate through supramolecular structures that target specific lipids9.",

In patients with autosomal-dominant NF-\u03baB2 deficiency, these autoantibodies are found only in individuals who are heterozygous for variants associated with both transcription (p52 activity) loss of function (LOF) due to impaired p100 processing to generate p52, and regulatory (I\u03baB\u03b4 activity) gain of function (GOF) due to the accumulation of unprocessed p100, therefore increasing the inhibitory activity of I\u03baB\u03b4 (hereafter, p52LOF/I\u03baB\u03b4GOF).

Human inborn errors of the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway impair the development of AIRE-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells, thereby underlying the production of autoantibodies against type I IFNs and predisposition to viral diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "In eukaryotes, repetitive DNA sequences are transcriptionally silenced through histone H3 lysine\u20099 trimethylation (H3K9me3). Loss of silencing of the repeat elements leads to genome instability and human diseases, including cancer and ageing1-3. Although the role of H3K9me3 in the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin silencing has been extensively studied4-6, the pattern and mechanism that underlie the partitioning of parental H3K9me3 at replicating DNA strands are unknown. Here we report that H3K9me3 is preferentially transferred onto the leading strands of replication forks, which occurs predominantly at long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) retrotransposons (also known as LINE-1s or L1s) that are theoretically transcribed in the head-on direction with replication fork movement. Mechanistically, the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex interacts with the leading-strand DNA polymerase Pol\u2009\u03b5 and contributes to the asymmetric segregation of H3K9me3. Cells deficient in Pol\u2009\u03b5 subunits (POLE3 and POLE4) or the HUSH complex (MPP8 and TASOR) show compromised H3K9me3 asymmetry and increased LINE expression. Similar results were obtained in cells expressing a MPP8 mutant defective in H3K9me3 binding and in TASOR mutants with reduced interactions with Pol\u2009\u03b5. These results reveal an unexpected mechanism whereby the HUSH complex functions with Pol\u2009\u03b5 to promote asymmetric H3K9me3 distribution at head-on LINEs to suppress their expression in S\u2009phase.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Targeting of intracellular oncoproteins with peptide-centric CARs.",
        "AbstractText": "The majority of oncogenic drivers are intracellular proteins, constraining their immunotherapeutic targeting to mutated peptides (neoantigens) presented by individual human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allotypes1. However, most cancers have a modest mutational burden that is insufficient for generating responses using neoantigen-based therapies2,3. Neuroblastoma is a paediatric cancer that harbours few mutations and is instead driven by epigenetically deregulated transcriptional networks4. Here we show that the neuroblastoma immunopeptidome is enriched with peptides derived from proteins essential for tumorigenesis. We focused on targeting the unmutated peptide QYNPIRTTF discovered on HLA-A*24:02, which is derived from the neuroblastoma-dependency gene and master transcriptional regulator PHOX2B. To target QYNPIRTTF, we developed peptide-centric chimeric antigen receptors (PC-CARs) through a counter panning strategy using predicted potentially cross-reactive peptides. We further proposed that PC-CARs can recognize peptides on additional HLA allotypes when presenting a similar overall molecular surface. Informed by our computational modelling results, we show that PHOX2B PC-CARs also recognize QYNPIRTTF presented by HLA-A*23:01, the most common non-A2 allele in people with African ancestry. Finally, we demonstrate potent and specific killing of neuroblastoma cells expressing these HLAs in vitro and complete tumour regression in mice. These data suggest that PC-CARs have the potential to expand the pool of immunotherapeutic targets to include non-immunogenic intracellular oncoproteins and allow targeting through additional HLA allotypes in a clinical setting.",

        "AbstractText": "Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine\u20099 (H3K9me3) is crucial for the regulation of gene repression and heterochromatin formation, cell-fate determination and organismal development1. H3K9me3 also provides an essential mechanism for silencing transposable elements1-4. However, previous studies have shown that canonical H3K9me3 readers (for example, HP1 (refs. 5-9) and MPP8 (refs. 10-12)) have limited roles in silencing endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), one of the main transposable element classes in the mammalian genome13. Here we report that trinucleotide-repeat-containing\u200918 (TNRC18), a poorly understood chromatin regulator, recognizes H3K9me3 to mediate the silencing of ERV class\u2009I (ERV1) elements such as LTR12 (ref. 14). Biochemical, biophysical and structural studies identified the carboxy-terminal bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain of TNRC18 (TNRC18(BAH)) as an H3K9me3-specific reader. Moreover, the amino-terminal segment of TNRC18 is a platform for the direct recruitment of co-repressors such as HDAC-Sin3-NCoR complexes, thus enforcing optimal repression of the H3K9me3-demarcated ERVs. Point mutagenesis that disrupts the TNRC18(BAH)-mediated H3K9me3 engagement caused neonatal death in mice and, in multiple mammalian cell models, led to derepressed expression of ERVs, which affected the landscape of cis-regulatory elements and, therefore, gene-expression programmes. Collectively, we describe a new H3K9me3-sensing and regulatory pathway that operates to epigenetically silence evolutionarily young ERVs and exert substantial effects on host genome integrity, transcriptomic regulation, immunity and development.",

        "AbstractText": "Complex chromosome rearrangements, known as chromoanagenesis, are widespread in cancer. Based on large-scale DNA sequencing of human tumours, the most frequent type of complex chromosome rearrangement is chromothripsis, a massive, localized and clustered rearrangement of one (or a few) chromosomes seemingly acquired in a single event. Chromothripsis can be initiated by mitotic errors that produce a micronucleus encapsulating a single chromosome or chromosomal fragment. Rupture of the unstable micronuclear envelope exposes its chromatin to cytosolic nucleases and induces chromothriptic shattering. Found in up to half of tumours included in pan-cancer genomic analyses, chromothriptic rearrangements can contribute to tumorigenesis through inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, activation of proto-oncogenes, or gene amplification through the production of self-propagating extrachromosomal circular DNAs encoding oncogenes or genes conferring anticancer drug resistance.

Mitochondria segregate during cell division and differentiation, with vertical inheritance of mitochondria and the mitochondrial DNA genome from parent to daughter cells.

In this Review, we describe the mechanisms by which mitochondria are transferred between cells and discuss how intercellular mitochondria transfer regulates the physiology and function of various organ systems in health and disease. In particular, we discuss the role of mitochondria transfer in regulating cellular metabolism, cancer, the immune system, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, mitochondrial quality control, wound healing and adipose tissue function.

Smart nanocarriers respond to their environment and can release their cargo in a controlled manner under the action of internal or external stimuli. In this work, we report on the development of an aerosol-assisted method for the synthesis of curcumin-loaded chitosan/alginate-based polymeric nanocarrier (CurNCs). A custom-fabricated multi-nebulizer system was utilized for the synthesis of CurNCs. The developed system comprises three main parts a sprayer, an electric heater tunnel, and a collector. Curcumin and chitosan solutions were sprayed using a pneumatic multinebulizer into the electric heater tunnel to form chitosan-curcumin assemblies. Then, the aerosol was guided into the collector solution containing sodium alginate and tri-poly phosphate aqueous solution for further cross-linkage. The synthesized CurNCs were characterized using TEM, DLS, and FTIR techniques. The TEM size of the nanoparticles was 8.62\u2009\u00b1\u20092.25\u00a0nm. The release experiments revealed that the nanocarrier is sensitive to the environment pH as more curcumin is released at acidic pH values (as is the case for cancerous tissues) compared to physiological pH. The curcumin content of the nanocarrier was 77.27\u00a0mg\u00a0g-1 with a drug loading efficiency of 62%. The in-vitro cytotoxicity of the synthesized nanocarrier was evaluated against the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. The IC50 concentrations for CurNCs and curcumin were obtained as 14.86 and 16.45\u00a0mg\u00a0mL-1, respectively. The results showed that while the empty nanocarrier shows non-significant cytotoxicity, the CurNCs impact the cell culture and cause prolonged cell deaths. Overall, pH-responsive curcumin polymeric nanocarrier was synthesized using a custom fabricated aerosol-based method.

Its encoded protein kinase ATM plays a fundamental role in DNA repair of double strand breaks (DSBs). Impaired function of this kinase leads to a multisystemic disorder including immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar degeneration, radiation sensitivity, dilated blood vessels, premature aging and a predisposition to cancer. Since allogenic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation improved disease outcome, gene therapy based on autologous HSCs is an alternative promising concept. However, due to the large cDNA of ATM (9.2\u00a0kb), efficient packaging of retroviral particles and sufficient transduction of HSCs remains challenging.We generated lentiviral, gammaretroviral and foamy viral vectors with a GFP.F2A.Atm fusion or a GFP transgene and systematically compared transduction efficiencies. Vector titers dropped with increasing transgene size, but despite their described limited packaging capacity, we were able to produce lentiviral and gammaretroviral particles. The reduction in titers could not be explained by impaired packaging of the viral genomes, but the main differences occurred after transduction. Finally, after transduction of Atm-deficient (ATM-KO) murine fibroblasts with the lentiviral vector expressing Atm, we could show the expression of ATM protein which phosphorylated its downstream substrates (pKap1 and p-p53).",

Several studies showed that the dysregulation of DDIT4 is involved in different malignancies with paradoxical expressions and roles.

The expression of DDIT4 and long non-coding RNA (TPTEP1) in mRNA level was examined in 27 fresh PT samples using Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Moreover, 200 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PT tissues, as well as 27 adjacent normal tissues, were collected to evaluate the clinical significance, prognostic, and diagnosis value of DDIT4 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays (TMA) slides. The results of RT-qPCR showed that the expression of DDIT4 in tumor samples was higher than in normal samples which was associated with high tumor grade (P\u2009=\u20090.015) and lymphovascular invasion (P\u2009=\u20090.048). Similar to this, IHC findings for nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane localization showed higher expression of DDIT4 protein in PT samples rather than in nearby normal tissues. A statistically significant association was detected between a high level of nuclear expression of DDIT4 protein, and lymphovascular invasion (P\u2009=\u20090.025), as well as advanced TNM stage (P\u2009=\u20090.034) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET), respectively.

This static approach means we lack information about the genomic and epigenomic changes that occur during the majority of tumor progression. One particularly understudied phase of tumor progression is metastatic colonization, during which cells must adapt to the new microenvironment of the secondary organ. Through temporal profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in vivo, we identify dynamic changes in the epigenome that occur as osteosarcoma tumors form and grow within the lung microenvironment. Furthermore, we show through paired in vivo and in vitro CRISPR drop-out screens and pharmacological validation that the upstream transcription factors represent a class of metastasis-specific dependency genes. While current models depict lung colonization as a discrete step within the metastatic cascade, our study shows it is a defined trajectory through multiple epigenetic states, revealing new therapeutic opportunities undetectable with standard approaches.",

        "AbstractText": "Allogeneic V\u03b39V\u03b42 (V\u03b42) T cells have emerged as attractive candidates for developing cancer therapy due to their established safety in allogeneic contexts and inherent tumor-fighting capabilities. Nonetheless, the limited clinical success of V\u03b42 T cell-based treatments may be attributed to donor variability, short-lived persistence, and tumor immune evasion. To address these constraints, we engineer V\u03b42 T cells with enhanced attributes. By employing CD16 as a donor selection biomarker, we harness V\u03b42 T cells characterized by heightened cytotoxicity and potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) functionality. RNA sequencing analysis supports the augmented effector potential of V\u03b42 T cells derived from CD16 high (CD16Hi) donors. Substantial enhancements are further achieved through CAR and IL-15 engineering methodologies. Preclinical investigations in two ovarian cancer models substantiate the effectiveness and safety of engineered CD16Hi V\u03b42 T cells. These cells target tumors through multiple mechanisms, exhibit sustained in vivo persistence, and do not elicit graft-versus-host disease. These findings underscore the promise of engineered CD16Hi V\u03b42 T cells as a viable therapeutic option for cancer treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Artificial RNA translation modulation usually relies on multiple components, such as RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or microRNAs (miRNAs) for off-switches and double-inverter cascades for on-switches. Recently, translational circular RNAs (circRNAs) were developed as promising alternatives for linear messenger RNAs (mRNAs). However, circRNAs still lack straightforward and programmable translation control strategies. Here, we rationally design a programmable miRNA-responsive internal ribosome entry site (IRES) translation activation and repression (PROMITAR) platform capable of implementing miRNA-based translation upregulation and downregulation in a single RNA construct. Based on the PROMITAR platform, we construct logic gates and cell-type classifier circRNAs and successfully identify desired mammalian cell types. We also demonstrate the potential therapeutic application of our platform for targeted cancer cell killing by encoding a cytotoxic protein in our engineered circRNAs. We expect our platform to expand the toolbox for RNA synthetic biology and provide an approach for potential biomedical applications in the future.",

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor SHARP1 (Split and Hairy-related Protein 1) has been identified as a suppressor of the metastatic behavior of TNBC. SHARP1 blocks the invasive phenotype of TNBC by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factors and its loss correlates with poor survival of breast cancer patients. Here, we show that SHARP1 is an unstable protein that is targeted for proteasomal degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF\u03b2TrCP. SHARP1 recruits \u03b2TrCP via a phosphodegron encompassing Ser240 and Glu245 which are required for SHARP1 ubiquitylation and degradation. Furthermore, mice injected with TNBC cells expressing the non-degradable SHARP1(S240A/E245A) mutant display reduced tumor growth and increased tumor-free survival. Our study suggests that targeting the \u03b2TrCP-dependent degradation of SHARP1 represents a therapeutic strategy in TNBC.",

Here, we analyze the transcriptomic and immune-metabolic profiles of Dendritic Cells (DCs) from 35 subjects enrolled in a trial of DC vaccines in late-stage melanoma (NCT01622933). Multiple platforms identify metabolism as an important biomarker of DC function and patient overall survival (OS). We demonstrate multiple immune and metabolic gene expression pathway alterations, a functional decrease in OCR/OXPHOS and increase in ECAR/glycolysis in patient vaccines. To dissect molecular mechanisms, we utilize single cell SCENITH functional profiling and show patient clinical outcomes (OS) correlate with DC metabolic profile, and that metabolism is linked to immune phenotype. With single cell metabolic regulome profiling, we show that MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter-1), a lactate transporter, is increased in patient DCs, as is glucose uptake and lactate secretion. Importantly, pre-vaccination circulating myeloid cells in patients used as precursors for DC vaccine generation are significantly skewed metabolically as are several DC subsets. Together, we demonstrate that the metabolic profile of DC is tightly associated with the immunostimulatory potential of DC vaccines from cancer patients. We link phenotypic and functional metabolic changes to immune signatures that correspond to suppressed DC differentiation.",

However, the intravital heterogeneity of EVs remains unclear, and the general limitation for analyzing EVs is the need for a certain volume of biofluids. Here, we present cellulose nanofiber (CNF) sheets to resolve these issues. We show that CNF sheets capture and preserve EVs from ~10\u2009\u03bcL of biofluid and enable the analysis of bioactive molecules inside EVs. By attaching CNF sheets to moistened organs, we collect EVs in trace amounts of ascites, which is sufficient to perform small RNA sequence analyses. In an ovarian cancer mouse model, we demonstrate that CNF sheets enable the detection of cancer-associated miRNAs from the very early phase when mice did not have apparent ascites, and that EVs from different locations have unique miRNA profiles. By performing CNF sheet analyses in patients, we identify further location-based differences in EV miRNA profiles, with profiles reflecting disease conditions. We conduct spatial exosome analyses using CNF sheets to reveal that ascites EVs from cancer patients exhibit location-dependent heterogeneity. This technique could provide insights into EV biology and suggests a clinical strategy contributing to cancer diagnosis, staging evaluation, and therapy planning.",

        "AbstractText": "Post-translational modification of proteins with polyubiquitin chains is a critical cellular signaling mechanism in eukaryotes with implications in various cellular states and processes. Unregulated ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation can be detrimental to cellular homeostasis, causing numerous diseases including cancers. Recently, macrocyclic peptides were developed that selectively target long Lysine-48-linked polyubiquitin chains (tetra-ubiquitin) to inhibit ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to attenuation of tumor growth in vivo. However, structural determinants of the chain length and linkage selectivity by these cyclic peptides remained unclear. Here, we uncover the mechanism underlying cyclic peptide's affinity and binding selectivity by combining X-ray crystallography, solution NMR, and biochemical studies. We found that the peptide engages three consecutive ubiquitins that form a ring around the peptide and determined requirements for preferential selection of a specific trimer moiety in longer polyubiquitin chains. The structural insights gained from this work will guide the development of next-generation cyclic peptides with enhanced anti-cancer activity.",

        "AbstractText": "Skin Cancer (SC) is one of the most dangerous types of cancer and if not treated in time, it can threaten the patient's life. With early diagnosis of this disease, treatment methods can be used more effectively and the progression of the disease can be prevented. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be utilized as a useful and efficient tool for SCD. So far, various methods for automatic SCD based on ML techniques have been presented; However, this research field still requires the application of optimal and efficient models to increase the accuracy of SCD. Therefore, in this article, a new method for SCD using a combination of optimization techniques and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is presented. The proposed method includes four steps: pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Image segmentation for identifying the lesion region is performed using a Kohonen neural network, where the identified region of interest (ROI) is enhanced using the Greedy Search Algorithm (GSA). The proposed method, uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting features from ROIs. Also, to classify features, an ANN is used, and by the Improved Gray Wolf Optimization (IGWO) algorithm, the number of neurons and weight vector are adjusted. In this method, a probabilistic model is used to improve the convergence speed of the GWO algorithm. Based on the evaluation results, using the IGWO model to optimize the structure and weight vector of the ANN can be effective in increasing the diagnosis accuracy by at least 5%. The results of implementing the proposed method and comparing its performance with previous methods also show that this method can diagnose SC in the ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2017 databases with an average accuracy of 97.09 and 95.17%, respectively; which improves accuracy by at least 0.5% compared to other methods.",

The latter is in large part mediated by cancer-associated fibroblasts which mediate tumour progression and poor prognosis. However, understanding of the crosstalk between cancer cells and fibroblasts in this disease is mostly lacking. Here, using co-cultures of patient-derived mesothelioma cell lines and lung fibroblasts, we demonstrate that fibroblast activation is a self-propagated process producing a fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) and triggering drug resistance in mesothelioma cells. Following characterisation of mesothelioma cells/fibroblasts signalling crosstalk, we identify several FDA-approved targeted therapies as far more potent than standard-of-care Cisplatin/Pemetrexed in ECM-embedded co-culture spheroid models. In particular, the SRC family kinase inhibitor, Saracatinib, extends overall survival well beyond standard-of-care in a mesothelioma genetically-engineered mouse model. In short, we lay the foundation for the rational design of novel therapeutic strategies targeting mesothelioma/fibroblast communication for the treatment of mesothelioma patients.",

The HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) T-DXd has shown broad activity across cancer types, with current indications for patients with biomarker-selected breast, gastric, and non-small-cell lung cancer and relevant activity observed in multiple histology-specific trials. Moreover, two recently reported phase 2 trials (DESTINY-Pantumor02 and HERALD) have supported the potential for a pan-cancer utilization of this ADC in patients with advanced cancers expressing HER2 or with HER2 amplifications. By improving the delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy, ADCs have allowed for meaningful clinical advantages in broad populations of cancer patients, often leading to survival advantages over conventional chemotherapy. Notably, the broad spectrum of activity of certain ADCs has led to the hypothesis of a histology-agnostic utilization based on detecting specific biomarkers, similar to what is already established for certain targeted treatments and immunotherapy. To date, T-DXd has shown the broadest activity across cancer types, with current approvals in breast, gastric, and lung cancer, and relevant antitumor activity observed in a multiplicity of additional cancer types. The optimization of the drug dose, identification of predictive biomarkers, and clarification of mechanisms of resistance will be critical steps in view of a pan-histological expansion in the use of T-DXd.",

The stability of pooled hazard ratios (HRs) was examined by sensitivity analysis. Six retrospective studies with a total of 4565 NSCLC patients who received 4L-LND or did not receive 4L-LND were considered. The 4L-LND group had significantly better OS (HR\u2009=\u20090.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.91, P\u2009=\u20090.004) and DFS (HR\u2009=\u20090.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.88, P\u2009=\u20090.0002) than the non-4L-LND group, especially in the subgroup analysis of propensity score matching studies.

Traditional image quality instruments, fencepost and contrast phantoms, were utilized both in software and experimentally in a lab environment to investigate noise reduction techniques and to test the spatial and dose resolution of the system. Absolute dose uncertainty was assessed by measurements in a clinical 6 MV Flattening Filter Free (FFF) photon beam with dose rates in the range 0.2-6\u00a0Gy/s achieved via changing the distance from the source.\u00a0Design improvements included: equalizing the pathlengths of the interferometer, isolating the system from external vibrations and controlling the system's internal temperature as well as application of mathematical noise reduction techniques. Simulations showed that these improvements should increase the spatial resolution from 22 to 35 lp/mm and achieve a minimum detectable dose of 0.2\u00a0Gy, which was confirmed experimentally. In the FFF beam, the absolute dose uncertainty was dose rate dependent and decreased from 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 to 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u00a0Gy for dose rates of 0.2 and 6\u00a0Gy/s, respectively.\u00a0A radiation dosimeter utilizing the principles of OC was developed and constructed.

        "AbstractText": "COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), which can lead to pneumonia, cytokine storms, and lymphopenia. Patients with cancer are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 due to immunosuppression. Recent studies have indicated that NRP1 (Neuropilin 1) may act as a novel mediator of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell. As no systematic review has been performed investigating the characteristics of NRP1 in pan-carcinoma, we comprehensively analyzed NRP1 in patients with pan-cancer. Using a bioinformatics approach, we aimed to systematically examine NRP1 expression profiles in both pan-carcinoma and healthy tissues. We found that lung and genitourinary cancers have a relatively higher NRP-1 expression than other cancer patients, suggesting that these patients may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis further revealed that NRP1 expression was downregulated in Vero E6 cells, whole blood, lung organoids, testis tissue, and alveolospheres infected with SARS-CoV-2. Notably, NRP1 was associated with immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, and immune-related genes in most patients with cancer. These findings suggest that, in patients with specific types of cancer, especially lung and genitourinary, high expression of NRP1 contributes to greater susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and an increased risk of damage due to cytokine storms. Overall, NRP1 appears to play a critical role in regulating immunological properties and metabolism in many tumor types. Specific inhibitors of the NRP1 antigen (pegaptanib, EG00229, or MNRP1685A) combined with other anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies may aid in treating patients with lung and genitourinary cancers following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Several factors, including advancing age, nulliparity, reduced lactation rates, decreased use of oral contraceptive pills, genetic mutations in BRCA (breast cancer) genes, and the use of assisted reproductive technology, may increase the risk of OCS. Poor prognostic factors include an advanced stage at diagnosis, older age, lymph node metastasis, suboptimal surgical cytoreduction, the presence of heterologous features on histopathology, and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumour protein p53, and p53 alongside Wilms tumour 1 (WT1).

        "ArticleTitle": "JAK-STAT signaling in inflammation and stress-related diseases: implications for therapeutic interventions.",
        "AbstractText": "The Janus kinase-signal transducer and transcription activator pathway (JAK-STAT) serves as a cornerstone in cellular signaling, regulating physiological and pathological processes such as inflammation and stress. Dysregulation in this pathway can lead to severe immunodeficiencies and malignancies, and its role extends to neurotransduction and pro-inflammatory signaling mechanisms. Although JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs) have successfully treated immunological and inflammatory disorders, their application has generally been limited to diseases with similar pathogenic features. Despite the modest expression of JAK-STAT in the CNS, it is crucial for functions in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, making it relevant in conditions like Parkinson's disease and other neuroinflammatory disorders. Furthermore, the influence of the pathway on serotonin receptors and phospholipase C has implications for stress and mood disorders. This review expands the understanding of JAK-STAT, moving beyond traditional immunological contexts to explore its role in stress-related disorders and CNS function. Recent findings, such as the effectiveness of Jakinibs in chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, expand their therapeutic applicability. Advances in isoform-specific inhibitors, including filgotinib and upadacitinib, promise greater specificity with fewer off-target effects. Combination therapies, involving Jakinibs and monoclonal antibodies, aiming to enhance therapeutic specificity and efficacy also give great hope. Overall, this review bridges the gap between basic science and clinical application, elucidating the complex influence of the JAK-STAT pathway on human health and guiding future interventions.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) remains a significant post-surgical complication of breast cancer treatment. Immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) at the time of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has shown promise in preventing BCRL. While the primary literature supporting ILR comes from academic institutions, the majority of breast cancer care in the USA occurs in the community setting. This study evaluated a preventative lymphedema program performing ILR at a community health system. A prospective database including all patients who underwent ALND with concurrently attempted ILR from 2019 to 2021 was retrospectively reviewed. The historical benchmark lymphedema rate was calculated through retrospective review of electronic medical records for all patients who underwent ALND without ILR from 2011 to 2021. Ninety patients underwent ALND with ILR, of which ILR was successful in 69 (76.7%). ILR was more likely to be aborted in smokers (p < 0.05) and those with fewer lymphatic channels (p < 0.05) or a higher body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.08). Patients with successful versus aborted ILR had lower lymphedema rates (10.9% versus 66.7%, p < 0.01) and improved Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores (8.7 versus 19.8, p = 0.25), and lower lymphedema rates than the historical benchmark (10.9% versus 50.2%, p < 0.01). Among patients with successful ILR, older patients were more likely to develop lymphedema (p < 0.05). Successful ILR after ALND significantly reduced the lymphedema rate when compared with patients with aborted ILR and our institution's historical benchmark. Our experience supports the efficacy of ILR and highlights the feasibility of ILR within a community health system.",

        "AbstractText": "Medical image registration is a critical preprocessing step in medical image analysis. While traditional medical image registration techniques have matured, their registration speed and accuracy still fall short of clinical requirements. In this paper, we propose an improved VoxelMorph network incorporating ResNet modules and CBAM (RCV-Net), for 3D multimodal unsupervised registration. Unlike popular convolution-based U-shaped registration networks like VoxelMorph, RCV-Net incorporates the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) during the convolution process. This inclusion enhances the feature map information extraction capabilities during training and effectively prevents information loss. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight and residual network module at the network's base, which enhances learning ability without significantly increasing training parameters. To evaluate the superiority of our registration model, we utilize evaluation metrics such as structural similarity (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and mean square error (MSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed network structure outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, yielding better performance in multimodal registration tasks. Furthermore, generalization testing on databases outside of the training set has confirmed the optimal registration effectiveness of our model.",

Records of all performed CT and MRI of the brain during two time periods were retrospectively reviewed in search of patients with presumed incidental meningioma. These patients were further analyzed using medical health records, with the purpose to study clinical handling and outcome during a 3 year follow up. An identical number of unique patients underwent brain imaging during the two time periods (n\u2009=\u200922 259 vs. 22 013). In 2018-2019, 25% more incidental meningiomas were diagnosed compared to 2008-2009 (n\u2009=\u2009161 vs. 129, p\u2009=\u20090.052). MRI was used more often in 2018-2019 (26.1 vs. 12.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.004), and the use of contrast enhancement, irrespective of modality, also increased (26.8 vs. 12.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In the most recent cohort, patients were older (median 79 years vs. 73 years, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Indications showed a significant increase of cancer without known metastases among scanned patients. 29.5 and 35.4% of patients in the cohorts were deceased 3 years after diagnosis for causes unrelated to their meningioma. Despite the same number of unique patients undergoing brain scans in the time periods, there was a trend towards more patients diagnosed with an incidental asymptomatic meningioma in the more recent years. This difference may be attributed to more contrast enhanced scans and more scans among the elderly but needs to be further studied. Patients in the cohort from 2018 to 2019 more often had non-metastatic cancer, with their cause of scan screening for metastases. There was no significant difference in management decision at diagnosis, but within 3 years of follow up significantly more patients in the latter cohort had been re-scanned. Almost a third of all patients were deceased within 3 years after diagnosis, due to causes other than their meningioma.",

Physical function was measured using questionnaire. The prevalence of reduced function was compared to siblings using generalized estimating equations, overall and stratified by treatment decade.

However, its potential application in ovarian cancer (OC) has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we sought to investigate the efficacy of CUDC-907 in treating OC, both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we examined the correlation between PI3K or HDAC expression and the prognosis of OC patients using the GEPIA database. RNA-Seq analysis was performed on OC cells treated with CUDC-907.To assess various cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and cell cycle, we performed a series of assays, including the CCK8, EDU, wound healing, cell invasion, and flow cytometry assays. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting were performed to measure the expressions of target genes. Additionally, we utilized the SKOV3 xenograft tumor model to investigate the inhibitory effects of CUDC-907 on tumor growth in vivo. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that up-regulated HDAC and PI3K were significantly correlated with patients' poor survival in OC. In vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that CUDC-907 could inhibit the proliferation of OC cells by inhibiting the PI3K and HDAC pathways to down-regulate the expression of c-Myc, and induce cell apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 pathway, and up-regulate p21 to induce G2 /M phase arrest. Our results showed that CUDC-907 had powerful anti-tumor effects on OC, which could provide a theoretical and experimental basis for the application of CUDC-907 in the therapy of OC.",

Each report was processed by GPT-4, resulting in the generation of a corresponding AI-generated report. Quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques were utilized to assess similarities and differences between the two sets of reports. The AI-generated reports showed comparable quality to radiologist-generated reports in most categories. Significant differences were observed in clarity (p\u2009=\u20090.027), ease of understanding (p\u2009=\u20090.023), and structure (p\u2009=\u20090.050), favoring the AI-generated reports. AI-generated reports were more concise, with 34.53 fewer words and 174.22 fewer characters on average, but had greater variability in sentence length. Content similarity was high, with an average Cosine Similarity of 0.85, Sequence Matcher Similarity of 0.52, BLEU Score of 0.5008, and BERTScore F1 of 0.8775. The results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that GPT-4 can be a reliable tool for generating standardized radiology reports, offering potential benefits such as improved efficiency, better communication, and simplified data extraction and analysis. However, limitations and ethical implications must be addressed to ensure the safe and effective implementation of this technology in clinical practice. The findings of this study suggest that GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4), an advanced AI model, has the potential to significantly contribute to the standardization and optimization of radiology reporting, offering improved efficiency and communication in clinical practice. \u2022 Large language model-generated radiology reports exhibited high content similarity and moderate structural resemblance to radiologist-generated reports. \u2022 Performance metrics highlighted the strong matching of word selection and order, as well as high semantic similarity between AI and radiologist-generated reports. \u2022 Large language model demonstrated potential for generating standardized radiology reports, improving efficiency and communication in clinical settings.",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines have been developed to optimize pre-, intra-, and postoperative care of surgical oncology patients. The aim of this study was to compare management outcome of patients undergoing head and neck cancer (HNC) surgery with free flap reconstruction at our institution before and after the implementation of the ERAS guidelines. This retrospective study comprised 283 patients undergoing HNC surgery with free flap reconstruction between 2013 and 2020. Patients operated before and after the implementation of the ERAS protocol in October 2017 formed the pre-ERAS group (n\u2009=\u2009169), and ERAS group (n\u2009=\u2009114), respectively. In the pre-ERAS group the mean length of stay (LOS) and intensive care unit length of the stay (ICU-LOS) were 20\u00a0days (range 7-79) and 6\u00a0days (range 1-32), and in the ERAS group 13\u00a0days (range 3-70) and 5\u00a0days (range 1-24), respectively. Both LOS (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and ICU-LOS (p\u2009=\u20090.042) were significantly reduced in the ERAS group compared to the pre-ERAS group. There were significantly fewer medical complications in the ERAS group (p\u2009<\u20090.003). No difference was found between the study groups in the surgical complication rate or in the 30-day or 6-month mortality rate after surgery. We found reduced LOS, ICU-LOS, and medical complication rate, but no effect on the surgical complication rate after implementation of the ERAS guidelines, which supports their use in major HNC surgery.",

        "AbstractText": "While the incidence and type of blood malignancies are well documented amid primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients (pSS), data focusing on solid neoplasms are more conflicting. We aimed to describe clinical, pathological, and immunological characteristics of pSS patients with cancers, along with the chronological interplay between the two conditions. Outcomes concerning both pSS and cancer were retrospectively collected from Montpellier University Hospital (tertiary center) between 2019 and 2020. pSS characteristics were compared to a control group of pSS patients without cancer. A total of 165 patients with pSS were included: 55 patients with cancer (52 female, mean age 58.4\u2009\u00b1\u200910.4\u00a0years at pSS diagnosis; mean follow-up 10.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1\u00a0years, 12 patients had multiple cancers) and 110 controls without cancer. Characteristics of pSS patients with cancers were different from controls mostly for lymphoma prognosis factors. Among the 70 cancers, we recorded 55 solid neoplasms (whom 27 breast cancers and 8 lung cancers, and 82% of adenocarcinomas), with no evidence of disease at the end of follow-up in 85% of them. Among the 15 recorded blood malignancies, ten were lymphomas with an excellent prognosis. Regarding chronological interplay between cancer and pSS, most cancers (43%) were diagnosed close (\u00b1\u20095\u00a0years) to pSS diagnosis. Breast cancers were diagnosed before or close to pSS diagnosis (mean delay\u2009-\u20091.8\u2009\u00b1\u200913.0\u00a0years), at an early stage, with only two relapses (no cancer-related death), while lung cancers were diagnosed late after. The tight chronological interplay between breast cancer and pSS and the intriguing pathological and immunological pattern of pSS in these patients suggest a hypothesis of immune control of cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "This study examined the composition of the immune microenvironment at different sites within resected pancreas specimens from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Therefore, single-cell suspensions were made from fresh tumor and non-tumorous tissue. Fourteen patients were included from whom twelve PDAC and five non-tumorous samples were obtained. These samples were analyzed with a nineteen marker panel on the Aurora spectral flow cytometer. Furthermore, slides from formalin-fixed paraffine PDACs of eight additional patients were stained with eight markers and analyzed by multispectral imaging. These corresponded to central tumor, periphery of the tumor, i.e., invasive front and resected lymph node and were divided into tumor and adjacent tissue. In the single-cell suspension, a decreased ratio between lymphoid and myeloid cells and between M1 and M2 macrophages was observed in the tumor tissue compared to non-tumorous tissue. Furthermore, an increase in CD169\u2009+\u2009macrophages in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy was found. Using immunofluorescence, more macrophages compared to T cells were observed, as well as a lower ratio of CD8 to M2 macrophage, a higher ratio of CD4-CD8 T cells and a higher ratio of immune-suppressive cells to pro-inflammatory cells in the PDAC area compared to the adjacent non-tumorous tissue. Finally, there were more immune-suppressive cells in the central tumor area compared to the invasive front. In conclusion, we show a gradient in the immune-suppressive environment in PDAC from most suppressive in the central tumor to least suppressive in distant non-tumorous tissue.",

        "AbstractText": "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) stands as a rare and locally aggressive soft tissue tumor, characterized by intricated molecular alterations. The imperative to unravel the complexities of intratumor heterogeneity underscores effective clinical management. Herein, we harnessed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to conduct a comprehensive analysis encompassing samples from primary sites, satellite foci, and lymph node metastases. Rigorous preprocessing of raw scRNA-seq data ensued, and employing t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) analysis, we unveiled seven major cell populations and fifteen distinct subpopulations. Malignant cell subpopulations were delineated using infercnv for copy number variation calculations. Functional and metabolic variations of diverse malignant cell populations across samples were deciphered utilizing GSVA and the scMetabolism R packages. Additionally, the exploration of differentiation trajectories within diverse fibroblast subpopulations was orchestrated through pseudotime trajectory analyses employing CytoTRACE and Monocle2, and further bolstered by GO analyses to elucidate the functional disparities across distinct differentiation states. In parallel, we segmented the cellular components of the immune microenvironment and verified the presence of SPP1+ macrophage, which constituted the major constituent in lymph node metastases. Remarkably, the CellChat facilitated a comprehensive intercellular communication analysis. This study culminates in an all-encompassing single-cell transcriptome atlas, propounding novel insights into the multifaceted nature of intratumor heterogeneity and fundamental molecular mechanisms propelling metastatic DFSP.",

A systematic search of online electronic databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus Web of Science, PsycINFO, and EMBASE was performed using keywords extracted from Medical Subject Headings such as \"Benson Relaxation Technique,\" \"Cancer Patients,\" \"Malignancy,\" and \"Neoplasia\" from the beginning to April 27, 2023. A total of 810 publications were assessed for relevance by title and abstract. The remaining 31 articles were examined using inclusion criteria for all Persian and English-language publications that evaluate the effectiveness of the Benson relaxation technique on cancer patients. We did not have gray literature in our review. The methodological quality of the included studies was appraised using specific checklists. Finally, nine studies were included in this systematic review. Studies on breast cancer patients showed improvement in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pain, shortness of breath, insomnia, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, treatment side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, worry about hair loss, and scores of hope. Two studies were conducted among cervical cancer patients that showed a decrease in anxiety scores and an improvement in the quality of sleep. Another study on gastric cancer patients showed decreased Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching scores. Overall, this systematic review showed that the Benson relaxation method could improve sleep quality, appetite, anxiety, and quality of life.

This is a prospective single-centre study with the primary objective of characterising resistance mechanisms to osimertinib in advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients treated both in first- and in second-line. Next-Generation Sequencing analysis was conducted on paired tissue biopsies and plasma samples. A concordance analysis between tissue and plasma was performed. Sixty-five advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib in first- (n\u2009=\u200956) or in second-line (n\u2009=\u20099) were included. We managed to perform tissue and liquid biopsies in 65.5% and 89.7% of patients who experienced osimertinib progression, respectively. Acquired resistance mechanisms were identified in 80% of 25 patients with post-progression samples, with MET amplification (n\u2009=\u20098), EGFR C797S (n\u2009=\u20093), and SCLC transformation (n\u2009=\u20092) the most frequently identified. The mean concordance rates between tissue and plasma for the EGFR activating mutation and for the molecular resistance mechanisms were 87.5% and 22.7%, respectively. Resistance to osimertinib demonstrated to be highly heterogeneous, with MET amplification the main mechanism.

Transgenic models suggest that there is a stringent affinity-based barrier to PC development. Whether a similar high-affinity barrier regulates PC development under physiologic circumstances and the nature of the PC fate decision has not been defined precisely. Here, we use a fate-mapping approach to examine the relationship between GC B cells selected to undergo additional rounds of affinity maturation, GC pre-PC, and PC. The data show that initial PC selection overlaps with GC B cell selection, but that the PC compartment accumulates a less diverse and higher affinity collection of antibodies over time. Thus, whereas the GC continues to diversify over time, affinity-based pre-PC selection sieves the GC to enable the accumulation of a more restricted group of high-affinity antibody-secreting PC.",

Three cases (2F,1\u00a0M) with histologically documented metastases (lymph node, skull, and liver) were retrieved and extensively investigated by immunohistochemistry, FISH, and next-generation sequencing. Tumors were composed of eosinophilic cells with prominent nucleoli (G3 by ISUP/WHO) arranged in solid to nested architecture. Additionally, there were larger cells with perinuclear cytoplasmic shrinkage and sparse basophilic Nissl-like granules, superficially resembling the so-called spider cells of cardiac rhabdomyomas. The renal tumors, including the skull and liver metastases, showed immunoexpression PAX8, CK8-18, and cathepsin-K, and negativity for vimentin. NGS identified mTOR genetic alterations in the three cases, including the skull and liver metastases. One patient was then treated with Everolimus (mTOR inhibitors) with clinical response (metastatic tumor shrinkage).

In this disease, E-cadherin-defective cells are detected invading the adjacent stroma since very early stages. Although E-cadherin loss is well established as a triggering event, other determinants of the invasive process persist largely unknown. Herein, we develop an experimental strategy that comprises in vitro extrusion assays using E-cadherin mutants associated to HDGC, as well as mathematical models epitomising epithelial dynamics and its interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM). In vitro, we verify that E-cadherin dysfunctional cells detach from the epithelial monolayer and extrude basally into the ECM. Through phase-field modelling we demonstrate that, aside from loss of cell-cell adhesion, increased ECM attachment further raises basal extrusion efficiency. Importantly, by combining phase-field and vertex model simulations, we show that the cylindrical structure of gastric glands strongly promotes the cell's invasive ability. Moreover, we validate our findings using a dissipative particle dynamics simulation of epithelial extrusion. Overall, we provide the first evidence that cancer cell invasion is the outcome of defective cell-cell linkages, abnormal interplay with the ECM, and a favourable 3D tissue structure.",

        "AbstractText": "Tankyrase 1 and 2 are ADP-ribosyltransferases that catalyze formation of polyADP-Ribose (PAR) onto themselves and their binding partners. Tankyrase protein levels are regulated by the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146, which promotes K48-linked polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of tankyrase and its partners. We identified a novel interaction between tankyrase and a distinct class of E3 ligases: the RING-UIM (Ubiquitin-Interacting Motif) family. We show that RNF114 and RNF166 bind and stabilize monoubiquitylated tankyrase and promote K11-linked diubiquitylation. This action competes with RNF146-mediated degradation, leading to stabilization of tankyrase and its binding partner, Angiomotin, a cancer cell signaling protein. Moreover, we identify multiple PAR-binding E3 ligases that promote ubiquitylation of tankyrase and induce stabilization or degradation. Discovery of K11 ubiquitylation that opposes degradation, along with identification of multiple PAR-binding E3 ligases that ubiquitylate tankyrase, provide insights into mechanisms of tankyrase regulation and may offer additional uses for tankyrase inhibitors in cancer therapy.",

Ataxin 3 (ATXN3) has been proven to play a cancer-promoting role in several tumors and is upregulated in the patients with renal cell carcinoma. Thus, the objective of this research is to examine the biological roles and underlying mechanisms of ATXN3 in ccRCC. Bioinformatics analysis was carried out to analyze ATXN3 expression in ccRCC tissues and patient survival. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were applied to explore the effect of ATXN3 on ccRCC cell malignant behavior in vitro. The effect of ATXN3 on the NF-\u03baB pathway was assessed by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The binding between ATXN3 and S100A8 and the effect of ATXN3 on S100A8 ubiquitination were verified using coimmunoprecipitation. ATXN3 was upregulated in ccRCC tissues and correlated with adverse patient outcome. ATXN3 overexpression facilitated the proliferation, stemness, invasion and migratory capacity of ccRCC cells, whereas silencing had the opposite effect. ATXN3 enhanced the activity of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Silencing ATXN3 facilitated S100A8 ubiquitination. Rescue experiments demonstrated that S100A8 downregulation reversed the promoting effect of ATXN3 on malignant behavior and NF-\u03baB pathway activation in ccRCC cells. ATXN3 exerts a cancer-promoting effect in ccRCC by regulating S100A8 ubiquitination. Therefore, targeting the ATXN3/S100A8/NF-\u03baB axis may provide a novel underlying therapeutic strategy for ccRCC.",

Comprehensive searches were conducted in multiple databases to identify relevant studies up until March 2023. Inclusion criteria required the intervention to involve walking combined with elastic band training, with a clear exercise protocol description. The primary outcome was CRF, and secondary outcomes included walking steps, distance, mood distress, and quality of life. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Ten trials were included. The intervention group showed significant improvements in CRF (SMD, -0.40; 95% CI, -0.60 to -0.20), mood distress (SMD, -0.30; 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.07), and daily walking steps (SMD, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.07-0.96) compared with the control group.

        "AbstractText": "Retromer prevents the destruction of numerous receptors by recycling them from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network or plasma membrane. This enables retromer to fine-tune the activity of many signaling pathways in parallel. However, the mechanism(s) by which retromer function adapts to environmental fluctuations such as nutrient withdrawal and how this affects the fate of its cargoes remains incompletely understood. Here, we reveal that macroautophagy/autophagy inhibition by MTORC1 controls the abundance of retromer+ endosomes under nutrient-replete conditions. Autophagy activation by chemical inhibition of MTOR or nutrient withdrawal does not affect retromer assembly or its interaction with the RAB7 GAP protein TBC1D5, but rather targets these endosomes for bulk destruction following their capture by phagophores. This process appears to be distinct from amphisome formation. TBC1D5 and its ability to bind to retromer, but not its C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) or nutrient-regulated dephosphorylation, is critical for retromer to be captured by autophagosomes following MTOR inhibition. Consequently, endosomal recycling of its cargoes to the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network is impaired, leading to their lysosomal turnover. These findings demonstrate a mechanistic link connecting nutrient abundance to receptor homeostasis.",

NSCLC-re-lated targets were collected from GeneCards and DisGeNET. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified GEO database, UCSC Xena, and limma. GO and KEGG analyses were performed using clusterProfiler. Autophagy-related genes and transcriptional factors were collected from HADb and KnockTF, respectively. STRING and Cytoscape were used for PPI network analysis. Immune cell infiltration in NSCLC was assessed using CIBERSORT, and its correlation with autophagy-related targets was evaluated. Molecular docking was conducted using PyMOL and AutoDock. qRT-PCR and CCK-8 assay was used for in vitro verification. Thirty intersecting targets of berberine-related targets, NSCLC-related targets, and DEGs were obtained. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that the intersecting targets were mainly implicated in oxidative stress, focal adhesion, and cell-substrate junction, as well as AGE-RAGE, relaxin, FoxO, and estrogen signaling pathways. Significantly, CAPN1, IKBKB, and SIRT2 were identified as the foremost autophagy-related targets, and 21 corresponding transcriptional factors were obtained. PPI network analysis showed that CAPN1, IKBKB, and SIRT2 interacted with 50 other genes. Fifty immune cell types, such as B cells naive, T cells CD8, T cells CD4 naive, T cells follicular helper, and monocytes, were implicated in NSCLC pathogenesis, and CAPN1, IKBKB, and SIRT2 were related to immune cells. Molecular docking revealed the favorable binding activity of berberine with CAPN1, IKBKB, and SIRT2.

        "AbstractText": "In this paper, we review a number of in vitro and in vivo studies regarding the efficacy of supercharged NK (sNK) cell therapy in elimination or treatment of cancer. We have performed studies using six different types of cancer models of oral, pancreatic, glioblastoma, melanoma, hepatic and ovarian cancers using hu-BLT mice. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that primary NK cells preferentially target cancer stem-like cells (CSCs)/poorly differentiated tumors whereas sNK cells target both CSCs/poorly-differentiated and well-differentiated tumors significantly higher than primary activated NK cells. Our in vivo studies in humanized-BLT mice showed that sNK cells alone or in combination with other cancer therapeutics prevented tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, sNK cells were able to increase IFN-\u03b3 secretion and cytotoxic function by the immune cells in bone marrow, spleen, gingiva, pancreas and peripheral blood. Furthermore, sNK cells were able to increase the expansion and function of CD8+ T cells both in in vitro and in vivo studies. Overall, our studies demonstrated that sNK cells alone or in combination with other cancer therapeutics were not only effective against eliminating aggressive cancers, but were also able to increase the expansion and function of CD8+ T cells to further target cancer cells, providing a successful approach to eradicate and cure cancer.",

        "ArticleTitle": "CSNK2 suppresses autophagy by activating FLN-NHL-containing TRIM proteins.",
        "AbstractText": "Macroautophagy/autophagy is a tightly regulated cellular process integral to homeostasis and innate immunity. As such, dysregulation of autophagy is associated with cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. While numerous factors that promote autophagy have been characterized, the key mechanisms that prevent excessive autophagy are less well understood. Here, we identify CSNK2/CK2 (casein kinase 2) as a negative regulator of autophagy. Pharmacological inhibition of CSNK2 activity or siRNA-mediated depletion of CSNK2 increased basal autophagic flux in cell lines and primary human lung cells. Vice versa, ectopic expression of CSNK2 reduced autophagic flux. Mechanistically, CSNK2 interacted with the FLN (filamin)-NHL domain-containing tripartite motif (TRIM) family members TRIM2, TRIM3 and TRIM71. Our data show that recruitment of CSNK2 to the C-terminal NHL domain of TRIM3 lead to its robust phosphorylation at serine 661 by CSNK2. A phosphorylation-defective mutant of TRIM3 was unable to reduce autophagosome numbers indicating that phosphorylation by CSNK2 is required for TRIM-mediated autophagy inhibition. All three TRIMs facilitated inactivation of the ULK1-BECN1 autophagy initiation complex by facilitating ULK1 serine 757 phosphorylation. Inhibition of CSNK2 promoted autophagy upon influenza A virus (IAV) and measles virus (MeV) infection. In line with this, targeting of CSNK2 or depletion of TRIM2, TRIM3 or TRIM71 enhanced autophagy-dependent restriction of IAV, MeV and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Thus, our results identify the CSNK2-TRIM2, -TRIM3, -TRIM71 axis as a key regulatory pathway that limits autophagy. Targeting this axis may allow for therapeutic induction of autophagy against viral infections and in diseases associated with dysregulated autophagy.",

        "AbstractText": "CD45.1/CD45.2 congenic markers have been used to track hematopoietic lineage differentiation following hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation. However, several studies suggest that a bias exists in CD45.1 versus CD45.2 hematopoietic cell reconstitution from HSPCs. Meanwhile, no definitive comparison has been reported for mature immune cells as to whether the CD45.1/CD45.2 disparity can skew the immune cell response. In this study, using lymphocytopenia Rag1-/- CD45.2 mice as hosts, we assessed the reconstitution potential of CD45.1 versus CD45.2 lymphocytes following adoptive transfer of mature T and B cells. We have found a selective bias for CD8+ T cells in that CD45.1 cells showed significantly higher reconstitution compared with CD45.2 cells, whereas CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells showed equivalent reconstitution. These results suggest that CD45.1/CD45.2 markers may induce an alloreactive response or a survival bias specific to CD8+ T cells, and they therefore call for caution for using them as congenic markers in immunologic models.",

        "AbstractText": "Obesity has been identified as a serious and debilitating disease that threatens human health, but the current treatment strategies still have some shortcomings. Exercise and dieting are difficult for many people to adhere to, and a series of surgical risks and pain brought about by volume reduction have made it difficult for the current weight loss effect to meet human expectations. In this study, we first found that mice with overexpression of the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 14 (KLF14) in subcutaneous adipose tissue gained weight more slowly while consuming a high-fat diet than did control mice, and these mice also showed reduced insulin resistance and liver lipid deposition abnormalities. Mechanistically, the browning of white adipose tissue was promoted in adipose tissue with KLF14 overexpression; therefore, we preliminarily concluded that KLF14 can improve obesity by promoting the browning of white adipose tissue and energy consumption, thus amelioratingobesity and related metabolic disturbances. In summary, our results revealed that KLF14 may promote white adipose tissue browning, thus ameliorating high-fat diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis, as well as serum lipid levels and insulin resistance, thereby achieving a positive effect on metabolism.",

We hypothesized that a positive p16 IHC may help to distinguish p53 inactivation in IHC negative cases. We investigated p53 and p16 immunostaining on 2710 urothelial bladder carcinomas in a tissue microarray format to understand their impact in relation to clinicopathological parameters of disease progression and patient outcome. p16 immunostaining was absent in normal urothelium but occurred in 63.5% (30.4% strong) of cancers. p16 strongly positive cases increased from pTaG2 low-grade (9.6%) to pTaG3 high-grade tumors (46.5%, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) but decreased from pTaG3 to pT4 (33.3%; p\u00a0=\u00a0.0030). Among pT2-4 carcinomas, p16 positivity was linked to high-grade (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0005) but unrelated to overall survival. p53 staining was negative in 8.4%, very weak in 15.4%, weak in 55.3%, strong in 4.7%, and very strong in 16.2% cancers. p53 negative (potentially p53 null phenotype), strong, and very strong p53 positivity increased from pTaG2 low-grade to pTaG3 high-grade tumors (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and from pTaG3 to pT2-4 cancers (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0007). p53 staining was largely unrelated to histopathological parameters or patient prognosis among pT2-4 carcinomas, except of p53 strong/very strong immunostaining. p16 expression predominated in tumors with very strong, strong, and negative p53 staining and the combination of p53 negative/p16 strongly positive cancers was linked to features of tumor aggressiveness. Aberrant p53 and p16 immunostaining increases during grade and stage progression although p53 negative and p16 positive immunostaining lack prognostic significance in pT2-4 carcinomas. Potential diagnostic features are that high level p16 expression is limited to neoplastic urothelium and p53 null phenotype to aggressive cancers (grade 3 and invasive).",

It remains unclear whether SMI exerts cardioprotective effect by regulating autophagy and apoptosis via miR-30a. This study evaluates the effects of SMI on ameliorating doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury. The level of LDH and CK, and the expression of miR-30a was detected. mCherry-EGFP-LC3B double fluorescence was used to observe autophagy flow. Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V/PI staining. Western Blot was used to estimate the expression of autophagy related proteins and apoptosis-related proteins. Compared with the control group, there were evidently decreased cell viability, elevated level of LDH and CK, down-regulated expression of miR-30a in the model group. Data from Western blot and fluorescence indicated that doxorubicin contributed to the elevated autophagy and apoptosis. Compared with the model group, there were increased cell viability, decreased level of LDH and CK, and up-regulated expression of miR-30a in the Shenmai group and the Shenmai + miR-30a inhibitor group. Meanwhile, the results manifested that there were suppressed autophagy flow accompanied by the down-regulated expression of Beclin-1, LC3-II, LC3-II/LC3-I and up-regulated expression of p62 protein, and declined apoptosis rate accompanied by the up-regulated Bcl2 expression and the down-regulated expression of Bax, Cleaved Caspase-9, Cleaved Caspase-9/Caspase-9, Cleaved Caspase-3, Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 in the Shenmai group and the Shenmai + miR-30a inhibitor group.

        "AbstractText": "Evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment (TME) affects the tumor active response to immunotherapy. Tumor angiogenesis is closely related to the TME. Nonetheless, the effects of angiogenesis on the TME of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unknown. We comprehensively assessed the angiogenesis patterns in CRC based on 36 angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs). Subsequently, we evaluated the prognostic values and therapeutic sensitivities of angiogenesis patterns using multiple methods. We then performed the machine learning algorithm and functional experiments to identify the prognostic key ARGs. Ultimately, the regulation of gut microbiota on the expression of ARGs was further investigated by using whole genome sequencing. Two angiogenesis clusters were identified and angiogenesis cluster B was characterized by increased stromal and immunity activation with unfavorable odds of survival. Further, an ARG_score including 9 ARGs to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) was established and its predominant predictive ability was confirmed. The low ARG_score patients were characterized by a high mutation burden, high microsatellite instability, and immune activation with better prognosis. Moreover, patients with high KLK10 expression were associated with a hot tumor immune microenvironment, poorer immune checkpoint blocking treatment, and shorter survival. The in vitro experiments also indicated that Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n) infection significantly induced KLK10 expression in CRC. The quantification of angiogenesis patterns could contribute to predict TME characteristics, prognosis, and individualized immunotherapy strategies. Furthermore, our findings suggest that F.n may influence CRC progression through ARGs, which could serve as a clinical biomarker and therapeutic target for F.n-infected CRC patients.",

This study compared the effectiveness of amivantamab to real-world systemic anti-cancer therapies in Japan. External control patients were selected by applying CHRYSALIS eligibility to Japanese patients from LC-SCRUM-Asia. External control patients were included for every qualifying line of therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy. Propensity score weighting was applied to external control patients to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. Outcomes were compared between external control patients, and all and Asian-only CHRYSALIS patients using weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models for progression-free survival (PFS), time to next therapy (TTNT), and overall survival (OS), and generalized estimating equations with repeated measurements for overall response rate (ORR). One hundred fifteen CHRYSALIS and 94 external control patients were identified. Compared to external control patients, amivantamab-treated patients had significantly longer OS (median OS 19.88 vs 14.09\u2009months, HR [95% CI] 0.59 [0.40-0.88]), PFS (median PFS 6.74 vs 4.73\u2009months, HR 0.59 [0.45-0.78]), TTNT (median TTNT 12.16 vs 5.09\u2009months, HR 0.39 [0.29-0.53]), and significantly higher ORR (41.7% vs 14.1%).

To further extend their biomedical practices, the development of collaborative MOF systems with good biocompatibility and synergistic efficacy is essential. Herein, the near-infrared and pH dual-response collaborative zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) platform SOR@ZIF-8@PDA (SZP) was constructed, in which the chemotherapeutic drug sorafenib (SOR) was encapsulated in ZIF-8 and via polydopamine (PDA) coating on ZIF-8 by hierarchical self-assembly. PDA coating serves as a photothermal agent for PPT while reducing the toxicity of ZIF-8. SZP achieves intelligent release of therapeutic drugs by responding to the lower pH of the tumor microenvironment and thermal stimulation generated by near-infrared light irradiation. In addition, under light irradiation, SZP could effectively realize treatment of cancer cells through synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy, as evidenced by the enhanced cell apoptosis, inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration.

        "AbstractText": "Since emerging in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has repeatedly crossed the species barrier with natural infections reported in various domestic and wild animal species. The emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) has expanded the range of susceptible host species. Previous experimental infection studies in cattle using Wuhan-like SARS-CoV-2 isolates suggested that cattle were not likely amplifying hosts for SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 sero- and RNA-positive cattle have since been identified in Europe, India, and Africa. Here, we investigated the susceptibility and transmission of the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in cattle. Eight Holstein calves were co-infected orally and intranasally with a mixed inoculum of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs Delta and Omicron BA.2. Twenty-four hours post-challenge, two sentinel calves were introduced to evaluate virus transmission. The co-infection resulted in a high proportion of calves shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 1- and 2-days post-challenge (DPC). Extensive tissue distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed at 3 and 7 DPC and infectious virus was recovered from two calves at 3 DPC. Next-generation sequencing revealed that only the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant was detected in clinical samples or tissues. Similar to previous experimental infection studies in cattle, we observed only limited seroconversion and no clear evidence of transmission to sentinel calves. Together, our findings suggest that cattle are more permissive to infection with SARS-CoV-2 Delta than Omicron BA.2 and Wuhan-like isolates but, in the absence of horizontal transmission, are not likely to be reservoir hosts for currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

Here, we systematically revealed the correlations of CRs with immunological features and the survival in LUAD patients based on a cohort of gene expression datasets from the public TCGA and GEO databases and real RNA-seq data by an integrative analysis using a comprehensive bioinformatics method. Totals of 160 differentially expressed CRs (DECRs) were identified between LUAD and normal lung tissues, and two molecular prognostic subtypes (MPSs) were constructed and evaluated based on 27 prognostic DECRs using five independent datasets (p =0.016, <0.0001, =0.008, =0.00038 and =0.00055, respectively). Six differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (CENPK, ANGPTL4, CCL20, CPS1, GJB3, TPSB2) between two MPSs had the most important prognostic feature and a six-gene prognostic model was established.

Six-gene prognostic signature had the highest concordance index of 0.673 compared with 19 reported prognostic signatures. The risk score was significantly correlated with immunological features and activities of oncogenic signaling pathways.

        "AbstractText": "Chronic ankle instability is a common sports injury that often presents with increased plantarflexion and restricted dorsiflexion. The cumulative effect of peripheral injuries may induce neuroplasticity in the central nervous system. However, the relationship between dorsiflexion or plantarflexion and the central nervous system in patients with chronic ankle instability remains unknown. (1) Is there a difference in region and voxel (volume pixel) of cortical activation during plantarflexion and dorsiflexion between patients with chronic ankle instability and a control group with normal ankle function? (2) Is there a correlation between activation of sensorimotor-related brain regions and three clinical measurement scales of ankle function and disease severity in patients with chronic ankle instability? Between December 2020 and May 2022, we treated 400 patients who had chronic ankle instability. Ten percent (40 patients; mean \u00b1 standard deviation age 29 \u00b1 7 years; 17 male patients) were randomly selected to participate in this study. We recruited 42 volunteers with normal ankle function (mean age 28 \u00b1 5 years; 21 male participants) matched by age and education level. A total of 2.5% (1 of 40) of patients with bilateral chronic ankle instability and 30% (12 of 40) with left-sided chronic ankle injury did not meet our inclusion criteria and were excluded from the study. The control group underwent MRI with good image quality. Finally, 27 patients with chronic ankle instability (mean age 26 \u00b1 5 years; 10 male patients) and 42 participants with normal ankle function were enrolled. Ankle function and disease severity were assessed using three clinical scales: the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool, Karlsson-Peterson Ankle Function Score, and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score. A uniplanar and nonweightbearing ankle dorsiflexion-plantarflexion paradigm (a recognized model or pattern) was performed using a short-block design during the functional MRI scan. This experimental design included a series of on-off periods consisting of movement and a rest period. From 15\u00b0 of plantarflexion to 15\u00b0 of dorsiflexion, the manipulator allowed 30\u00b0 of ankle rotation. The cerebral excitability patterns between patients with chronic ankle instability and controls were analyzed using t-tests. We retained voxels with p values less than 0.05 in a voxel-level family-wise error correction. Clusters with voxel numbers greater than 10 were retained. The Cohen d coefficient was used to calculate between-group effect sizes. Spearman analysis was performed to explore the correlation between activation regions and the three clinical assessment scales. In the patient group, cortical activation was greater during plantarflexion than during dorsiflexion, which was different from that in the control group. The between-group comparison showed that patients with chronic ankle instability had reduced activation in the ipsilateral precuneus (cluster size = 35 voxels [95% CI -0.23 to 0.07]; p < 0.001) during dorsiflexion, whereas during plantarflexion, chronic ankle instability caused increased activation in the ipsilateral superior temporal gyrus (cluster size = 90 voxels [95% CI -0.73 to -0.13]; p < 0.001), precuneus (cluster size = 18 voxels [95% CI -0.56 to -0.19]; p < 0.001), supplementary motor area (cluster size = 57 voxels [95% CI -0.31 to 0.00]; p < 0.001), superior frontal gyrus (cluster size = 43 voxels [95% CI -0.82 to -0.29]; p < 0.001), medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (cluster size = 39 voxels [95% CI 0.41 to 0.78]; p < 0.001), and contralateral postcentral gyrus (cluster size = 100 voxels [95% CI -0.32 to 0.02]; p < 0.001). Patients with chronic ankle instability showed a large effect size compared with controls (Cohen d > 0.8). During plantarflexion, the number of activated voxels in the supplementary motor area had a modest, positive correlation with the Karlsson-Peterson Ankle Function Score (r = 0.52; p = 0.01), and the number of activated voxels in the primary motor cortex (M1) and primary sensory cortex (S1) had a weak, positive correlation with the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score in patients with chronic ankle instability (M1: r = 0.45; p = 0.02, S1: r = 0.49; p = 0.01). Compared with volunteers with normal ankle function, patients with chronic ankle instability had increased cortical activation during plantarflexion and decreased cortical activation during dorsiflexion. We analyzed the central neural mechanisms of chronic ankle instability in patients with sports injuries and provided a theoretical basis for the development of new central and peripheral interventions in the future. Because there was a positive correlation between the neural activity in sensorimotor-related regions during plantarflexion and clinical severity, clinicians might one day be able to help patients who have chronic ankle instability with neuromuscular rehabilitation by applying electrical stimulation to specific targets (such as S1M1 and the supplementary motor area) or by increasing activation of sensorimotor neurons through ankle movement.",

The recent investigations in the epigenetics of breast cancer reveal several aberrations in the expression levels of various HDAC enzymes. Henceforth, the present work entails the formulation and characterization of a lipid polymer-based hybrid nanoparticulate (LPN) system for delivery of an epigenetic modulator drug, Belinostat, for its clinical application in breast cancer. The size of Belinostat nanoparticles prepared using a modified hot homogenization method was found to be 166.6 \u00b1 19.95 nm with an encapsulation efficiency of 94.5 \u00b1 5.1%. In vitro characterization for cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and protein expression in two different breast cancer cells, 4T1 and MCF 7, revealed the superiority of the formulation in comparison with the free drug in MCF 7 cells. Subsequently, the behaviour of the formulation in in vivo settings of healthy and breast cancer xenograft bearing animals was analyzed using pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies. The results revealed that the formulation demonstrated multi-fold improvement in the pharmacokinetic parameters in tumor bearing animals when compared with the free drug while no difference in pharmacokinetic behaviour was observed in healthy animals indicating the altered biodistribution and specificity of the formulation in breast tumor. This was confirmed by the biodistribution studies exhibiting 20-fold improved uptake and retention of the nanoparticulate formulation in tumor tissues of the animal model at the end of 4 h. Thus, the developed LPN system holds potential to act as a novel drug delivery system for Belinostat with several advantages over the free drug.",

Understanding the occurrence, metastasis and other processes of cervical cancer (CC) is of great significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of tumours. Here, this study applied the univariate Cox regression model to determine the prognostic association of immune and hypoxia signature genes in CC, and used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox method to build immune and hypoxia related risk score model to uncover the immune signature of the TIME of CC. Moreover, we used in\u00a0vitro experiment to validate the expression level of signature genes. Notably, we assessed the predictive effect of anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy using risk score model. Through the LASSO Cox regression model, we obtained 12 characteristic genes associated with the prognosis of CC, and also associated with immunity and hypoxia. Interestingly, the high-risk group had the properties of high hypoxia and low immunity, while the low-risk group had the properties of low hypoxia and high immunity. In the low-risk group, patients lived longer and had a significant therapeutic advantage of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Established risk scores model can help predict response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy of CC. The survival rate of cervical cancer (CC) is still low. A prognostic model for CC is urgently needed to improve the prognosis and survival. This study constructed a risk scoring models based on 12 characteristic gene related to hypoxia and immunity, including CX3CL1, CXCL3, GHSR, DLL4, FGFR2, PDF, KLRK1, MAP3K14, RETNLB, PRDX2, P4HA1 and PGK1, which can help predict the prognosis of PD-1 immunotherapy in CC patients. The high-risk group may have the properties of high hypoxia and low immunity, while the low-risk group patients live longer and have obvious therapeutic advantages in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Our findings suggest a potential link between hypoxia, immunity, prognosis, tumour immune microenvironment and response to immunotherapy in CC patients.",

Approximately 3 years after this treatment, a novel salivary duct carcinoma emerged within the left parotid gland, prompting a second round of surgical intervention, again followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Subsequently, a recurrent tumor was identified within the left Stensen duct, necessitating additional surgical intervention. While monitoring for recurrence or metastases remains an important aspect of post-treatment care for salivary gland cancer, it is also imperative to consider the potential for developing a second primary salivary gland cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCP), also known as protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II [DCP]) are biomarkers for HCC with limited diagnostic value when used in isolation. The novel GAAD algorithm is an in vitro diagnostic combining PIVKA-II (DCP) and AFP measurements, age, and gender (biological sex) to generate a semi-quantitative result. We conducted prospective studies to develop, implement, and clinically validate the GAAD algorithm for differentiating HCC (early and all-stage) and benign chronic liver disease (CLD), across disease stages and etiologies. Patients aged \u226518 years with HCC or CLD were prospectively enrolled internationally into algorithm development [n = 1084; 309 HCC cases (40.7% early-stage) and 736 controls] and clinical validation studies [n = 877; 366 HCC cases (47.6% early-stage) and 303 controls]. Serum samples were analyzed on a cobas\u00ae e 601 analyzer. Performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to calculate AUC. For algorithm development, AUC for differentiation between early-stage HCC and CLD was 90.7%, 84.4%, and 77.2% for GAAD, AFP, and PIVKA-II, respectively. The sensitivity of GAAD for the detection of early-stage HCC was 71.8% with 90.0% specificity. Similar results were shown in the clinical validation study; AUC for differentiation between early-stage HCC and CLD was 91.4% with 70.1% sensitivity and 93.7% specificity. GAAD also showed strong specificity, with a lower rate of false positives regardless of disease stage, etiology, or region. The GAAD algorithm significantly improves early-stage HCC detection for patients with CLD undergoing HCC surveillance. Further phase III and IV studies are warranted to assess the utility of incorporating the algorithm into clinical practice.",

        "AbstractText": "Precision medicine and customized therapeutics based on the features of each patient are important for maximizing therapeutic effects. Because most cases of HCC occur in the damaged liver through various etiologies, such as hepatitis virus infection, steatohepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis, there should be a rationale for the choice of therapeutic options based on these etiologies. Although cabozantinib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, has demonstrated clinical effectiveness in advanced HCC, subgroup analyses showed a lower HR for death in HBV-related HCC. This study aimed to determine the therapeutic effects of cabozantinib in HBV-related HCC. Using HBV infection models and gene knockout cells, we determined the crucial signaling axis responsible for the effects of cabozantinib on HBV. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to determine the interaction between the signaling molecules and HBV DNA. Agonists and inhibitors were used for confirmation. Cabozantinib inhibited HBV replication through the HGF-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (MET-STAT3) signaling axis. The importance of STAT3 in viral replication has been confirmed using gene-edited STAT3 knockout cells. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the binding levels of phosphorylated STAT3 to enhancer region 1 of HBV covalently closed circular DNA were significantly increased by HGF stimulation. Cabozantinib has favorable therapeutic effects on HBV-related HCC because it inhibits HCC not only directly but also indirectly by means of inhibitory effects on HBV.",

        "AbstractText": "Dermatomyositis (DM)/polymyositis (PM) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by proximal limb muscle with high morbidity and mortality and poor prognosis mediated by immune dysfunction; its etiology is unknown. DM/PM patients are at excessive risk of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and a higher risk of death. However, the role of circulating lymphocyte subsets, which play a pivotal role in occurrence and progression of DM/PM and ILD, respectively, remains unclear in DM/PM patients with ILD. Demographic characteristics, general data, and peripheral lymphocyte levels measured by flow cytometry were collected and analyzed in 47\u2009DM/PM patients with ILD, 65 patients without ILD, and 105 healthy controls (HCs). The most important first symptom of DM/PM patients is rash. Compared with non-ILD patients, the levels of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) were significantly higher and the levels of C reactive protein (CRP) were significantly lower in patients with ILD. Compared with HCs, DM/PM patients, with or without ILD, had decreased absolute counts of T, CD4\u2009+\u2009T, CD8\u2009+\u2009T, natural killer (NK), helper T (Th) 1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg)cells. The fewest Th1 and Treg cells and the the lowest CD8\u2009+\u2009T and Th1 cells percentages were seen in peripheral blood of patients with ILD. Longer duration, decreased lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR)levels and CD8\u2009+\u2009T and Th1 cells proportions, and fewer circulating Treg cells were independent risk factors for DM/PM with ILD. The identification of peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets, especially Treg cells, and blood count in DM/PM appears to be useful in the comprehensive assessment of clinical lung involvement.",

        "AbstractText": "In the United States, ambulatory surgeries account for up to 87% of all surgical procedures. (1) It was estimated that 19.2 million ambulatory surgeries were performed in 2018 (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb287-Ambulatory-Surgery-Overview-2019.pdf). Cataract procedures and musculoskeletal surgeries are the most common surgical interventions performed in ambulatory centers. However, more complex surgical interventions, such as sleeve gastrectomies, oncological, and spine surgeries, and even arthroplasties are routinely performed as day cases or in a model of an ambulatory extended recovery. (2-5) The ambulatory surgery centers industry has grown since 2017 by 1.1% per year and reached a market size of $31.2 billion. According to the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association, there is a potential to save $57.6 billion in Medicare costs over the next decade (https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/ambulatory-surgery-centers-united-states/). These data suggest an expected rise in the volume of ambulatory (same day) or extended ambulatory (23\u00a0h) surgeries in coming years. Similar increases are also observed in other countries. For example, 75% of elective surgeries are performed as same-day surgery in the United Kingdom. (6) To reduce costs and improve the quality of care after those more complex procedures, ambulatory surgery centers have started implementing patient-centered, high-quality, value-based practices. To achieve those goals, Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols have been implemented to reduce the length of stay, decrease costs, increase patients' satisfaction, and transform clinical practices. The ERAS fundamentals for ambulatory surgery are based on five pillars, including (1) preoperative patient counseling, education, and optimization; (2) multimodal and opioid-sparing analgesia; (3) nausea and vomiting, wound infection, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis; (4) maintenance of euvolemia; and (5) encouragement of early mobility. Those pillars rely on interdisciplinary teamwork led by anesthesiologists, surgery-specific workgroups, and safety culture. (2) Research shows that a team of ambulatory anesthesiologists is crucial in improving postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain control. (7) This review will summarize the current evidence on the elements and clinical importance of implementing ERAS protocol for ambulatory surgery.",

Imaging did not localize a mass. SVS implicated the right ovary as the source of hyperandrogenism. Following laparoscopic right oophorectomy, pathology excluded a neoplasm and confirmed PCOS. She subsequently had rapid and persistent improvement in her hyperandrogenism. Striking testosterone elevation can occur with adolescent PCOS. SVS is a tool for localizing the source of severe hyperandrogenism, yet unilaterality is not always diagnostic of a neoplasm.

Here, we identify bipotent liver stem cells as novel targets for HCV infection, and their erroneous differentiation as the potential cause of impaired liver regeneration and cancer development. We show 3D organoids generated from liver stem cells from actively HCV-infected individuals carry replicating virus and maintain low-grade infection over months. Organoids can be infected with a primary HCV isolate. Virus-inclusive single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered transcriptional reprogramming in HCV+ cells supporting hepatocytic differentiation, cancer stem cell development, and viral replication while stem cell proliferation and interferon signaling are disrupted. Our data add a new pathogenesis mechanism-infection of liver stem cells-to the biology of HCV infection that may explain progressive liver damage and enhanced cancer risk through an altered stem cell state.ImportanceThe hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes liver disease, affecting millions. Even though we have effective antivirals that cure HCV, they cannot stop terminal liver disease. We used an adult stem cell-derived liver organoid system to understand how HCV infection leads to the progression of terminal liver disease. Here, we show that HCV maintains low-grade infections in liver organoids for the first time. HCV infection in liver organoids leads to transcriptional reprogramming causing cancer cell development and altered immune response.

However, the technical challenges in rapid isolation and multiplexed molecular detection of EVs have limited their clinical practice. Herein, we developed a dynamic magnetic driving tandem chip to achieve streamlined rapid isolation and multiplexed profiling of surface protein biomarkers of EVs. Driven by magnetic force, the magnetic nanomixers not only act as tiny stir bars to promote mass transfer and enhance reaction efficiency of EVs, but also transport on communicating vessels of tandem chip continuously and expedite the assay workflow. We designed cyclic surface enhancement of Raman scattering (SERS) tags to bind with target EVs and then release them by exonuclease I, eliminating steric hindrance and amplifying the SERS signal of multiple protein biomarkers on EVs. Due to the excellent assay performance, six breast cancer biomarkers were detected simultaneously on EVs using only 10 \u03bcL plasma within 1.5 h. The unweighted SUM signature offers great accuracy in discriminating breast cancer patients from healthy donors.

We evaluated the utility of TD as a triage tool to allow high-risk lesions of concern to be seen more expeditiously. Methods: Patient sociodemographic factors and histological characteristics of 836 melanomas biopsied between March 2020 and November 2022 in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center health system were retrospectively evaluated, stratified by initial appointment type of TD versus in-person visit. Results: Patients first seeking care through teledermatology had shorter wait times to initial evaluation (p < 0.001) and eventual biopsy (p < 0.001), and these melanomas had higher Breslow thickness (p < 0.001), were more ulcerated (p\u2009=\u20090.002), invasive (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and of a more aggressive subtype (p\u2009=\u20090.007) than those initially evaluated in-person.

While the kinase activity of AKT has been extensively explored, its dephosphorylation have largely remained uncharted. Herein, we aimed to unravel the molecular mechanisms governing AKT dephosphorylation, with a specific emphasis on dual-specificity phosphatases DUSP22. Our investigation sought to shed light on the potential of DUSP22 as a potential therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To determine the expression level of DUSP22 in NSCLC cell lines, the gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) and Oncomine database were searched. Additionally, the effect of DUSP22 on patient survival was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier database. Antitumor effects of DUSP22 were tested in A549 and H1299 cell lines. Experiments are based on: (1) cell viability determined by the cell counting kit-8 assay and colony-formation assay; (2) cell migratory ability assessed through\u00a0the scratch assay and the transwell migration assay; (3) the mechanism behind the antitumor effects of DUSP22 dissected with co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and in vitro kinase assays. Our study revealed a significant downregulation of\u00a0DUSP22 in both NSCLC cell lines and tissues. Meanwhile, survival rate analysis results demonstrated\u00a0that reduced DUSP22 expression was correlated with poorer\u00a0overall survival in lung cancer patients. Moreover, DUSP22 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the cell viability and migratory capacity of A549 and H1299 cells. This inhibition was accompanied by the decrease in the phosphorylation of AKT and p38. Mechanistically, the phosphatase domain of DUSP22 interacted with AKT, resulting in the\u00a0inhibition\u00a0of AKT phosphorylation. This inhibitory effect was contingent upon the phosphatase activity of DUSP22. These findings provide compelling evidence that DUSP22 directly interacted with AKT, leading to the dephosphorylation of\u00a0AKT at S473 and T308 residues, ultimately curbing the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells. Additionally, our results also highlight a preclinical rationale for utilizing DUSP22 as a prognostic marker in NSCLC.",

Matrix factorization is a common technique used in integrative clustering for identifying latent subtype structure across multi-omics data. High dimensionality of the omics data and long computation time have been common challenges of clustering methods. In order to address the challenges, we propose randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) for integrative clustering using Non-negative Matrix Factorization: intNMF-rsvd. The method utilizes RSVD to reduce the dimensionality by projecting the data into eigen vector space with user specified lower rank. Then, clustering analysis is carried out by estimating common basis matrix across the projected multi-omics datasets. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using the simulated datasets and compared with six state-of-the-art integrative clustering methods using real-life datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas Study. intNMF-rsvd was found working efficiently and competitively as compared to standard intNMF and other multi-omics clustering methods. Most importantly, intNMF-rsvd can handle large number of features and significantly reduce the computation time.

We then conducted a cluster-randomized trial at six gas stations with convenience stores, randomly assigned to the intervention (messages displayed) or no message control condition. We conducted intercept surveys with repeated cross-sectional samples of 50 participants (ages 16-25) per store, at baseline and a four-week follow-up. Phase 1 included 1,636 participants in the online study.

Herein, we report an mRNA encoding a self-DNA reactive variant of the enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), known as cGAS\u2206N. cGAS\u2206N produces the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP upon binding intra-mitochondrial DNA. cGAMP binds the protein STING, which activates innate immune responses that stimulate T cells. We found that when delivered to DCs via LNPs, mRNA-encoded cGAS\u2206N induced the upregulation of chemokine receptors, T cell costimulatory molecules, major histocompatibility complex proteins, pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons from murine and human DCs. These activities exceeded the immunostimulatory activities of mRNA-encoded antigens delivered via LNPs. Co-immunization of mice with antigen-LNPs and cGAS\u2206N-LNPs led to the robust production of antigen-specific IFN\u03b3-producing T cells. These T cell responses were durable and circulated through the lymphatics, blood, and lungs. Immunizations with antigen-LNPs alone, akin to what are used in the clinic, stimulated weak and transient T cell responses. Antibody responses to antigen-LNPs were biased towards type I isotypes when co-injected with cGAS\u2206N-LNPs, as compared to immunizations with antigen-LNPs alone. These findings establish the enzyme cGAS\u2206N as a catalytic adjuvant, which may prove useful in enhancing the immunogenicity of nucleic acid-based vaccines. IMPORTANCE Nucleic acid-based vaccines hold promise in preventing infections and treating cancer. The most common use of this technology is to encode antigenic proteins on mRNAs that are delivered to cells via lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations. In this study, we discovered that immunostimulatory proteins can also be encoded on mRNAs in LNPs. We found that an active mutant of the enzyme cGAS, referred to as cGAS\u2206N, acts as a catalytic adjuvant in LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccines. The delivery of cGAS\u2206N mRNA via LNPs in combination with antigen mRNA-LNPs led to durable antigen-specific IFN\u03b3-producing T cells that exceeded the efficiency of antigen-LNPs similar to those currently used in the clinic. This strategy did not compromise B cell responses; rather it induced Th1-biased antibody isotypes. This work unveils new vaccine design strategies using mRNA-encoded catalytic adjuvants that could be ideal for generating CD8+ T cell and B cell responses for immunotherapies.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A mechanistic insight into sources of error of visual working memory in multiple sclerosis.",
        "AbstractText": "Working memory (WM) is one of the most affected cognitive domains in multiple sclerosis (MS), which is mainly studied by the previously established binary model for information storage (slot model). However, recent observations based on the continuous reproduction paradigms have shown that assuming dynamic allocation of WM resources (resource model) instead of the binary hypothesis will give more accurate predictions in WM assessment. Moreover, continuous reproduction paradigms allow for assessing the distribution of error in recalling information, providing new insights into the organization of the WM system. Hence, by utilizing two continuous reproduction paradigms, memory-guided localization (MGL) and analog recall task with sequential presentation, we investigated WM dysfunction in MS. Our results demonstrated an overall increase in recall error and decreased recall precision in MS. While sequential paradigms were better in distinguishing healthy control from relapsing-remitting MS, MGL were more accurate in discriminating MS subtypes (relapsing-remitting from secondary progressive), providing evidence about the underlying mechanisms of WM deficit in progressive states of the disease. Furthermore, computational modeling of the results from the sequential paradigm determined that imprecision in decoding information and swap error (mistakenly reporting the feature of other presented items) was responsible for WM dysfunction in MS. Overall, this study offered a sensitive measure for assessing WM deficit and provided new insight into the organization of the WM system in MS population. Working memory is a system that temporarily stores and manipulates information used in tasks like decision-making and reasoning. Patients with multiple sclerosis \u2013 a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord \u2013 often have impaired working memory, which can negatively affect their quality of life. Traditionally, working memory has been evaluated using tests that determine whether a patient can recall an item or not. In this approach, an incorrect response implies a complete absence of information regarding the specific item, resulting in a binary evaluation. More recently, researchers have shown that the precision of the memories people recall degrades gradually as they are asked to remember more things and that focusing on an item negatively affects recall precision for other items. This implies that working memory is reorganised flexibly between memorised items, a so-called \u2018resource model\u2019. Unlike previous research, which favoured a binary model, Motahharynia et al. used a resource model to study visual working memory impairment in multiple sclerosis. The study participants consisted of healthy volunteers and patients with two subtypes of multiple sclerosis. Each participant completed one of two different types of test. In one, they were shown targets for short periods of time and then asked to pinpoint their position after they disappeared. In the other, participants were asked to memorise the orientation and colour of consecutively presented bars. The findings confirmed that multiple sclerosis patients had worse memory recall than people without the disease. However, computer modelling provided insights into the sources of error in working memory dysfunction, showing that the memory deficiency was due to imprecision in recalling information and \u2018swap errors\u2019, the phenomenon of mistakenly reporting the property of other memorised items. This rise in swap errors is likely due to an increase in unwanted signals, or noise, in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients. Motahharynia et al. have presented a sensitive way of measuring working memory deficiency. Importantly, the measurements were able to distinguish between different stages of multiple sclerosis. This could help doctors detect disease progression earlier, allowing for more timely and effective treatment interventions. This method could also be useful in the development and testing of drugs for therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems on breast ultrasound (BUS) aim to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of breast screening, helping specialists to detect and classify breast lesions. CAD system development requires a set of annotated images, including lesion segmentation, biopsy results to specify benign and malignant cases, and BI-RADS categories to indicate the likelihood of malignancy. Besides, standardized partitions of training, validation, and test sets promote reproducibility and fair comparisons between different approaches. Thus, we present a publicly available BUS dataset whose novelty is the substantial increment of cases with the above-mentioned annotations and the inclusion of standardized partitions to objectively assess and compare CAD\u00a0systems. The BUS dataset comprises\u00a01875 anonymized images from\u00a01064 female patients acquired via four ultrasound scanners during systematic studies at the National Institute of Cancer (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The dataset includes biopsy-proven tumors divided into\u00a0722 benign and\u00a0342 malignant cases. Besides, a senior ultrasonographer performed a BI-RADS assessment in categories\u00a02 to\u00a05. Additionally, the ultrasonographer manually outlined the breast lesions to obtain ground truth segmentations. Furthermore, 5- and 10-fold cross-validation partitions are provided to standardize the training and test sets to evaluate and reproduce CAD systems. Finally, to validate the utility of the BUS dataset, an evaluation framework is implemented to assess the performance of deep neural networks for segmenting and classifying breast\u00a0lesions. The BUS dataset is publicly available for academic and research purposes through an open-access repository under the name BUS-BRA: A Breast Ultrasound Dataset for Assessing CAD Systems. BUS images and reference segmentations are saved in Portable Network Graphic (PNG) format files, and the dataset information is stored in separate Comma-Separated Value (CSV)\u00a0files. The BUS-BRA dataset can be used to develop and assess artificial intelligence-based lesion detection and segmentation methods, and the classification of BUS images into pathological classes and BI-RADS categories.

        "AbstractText": "Advances in surgical practices have decreased hospital length of stay (LOS) after surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of short-stay (\u226424-hour) left colectomy for colon cancer patients in the United States. Adult colon cancer patients who underwent elective left colectomies were identified using the ACS-NSQIP database (2012-2021). Patients were categorized into four LOS groups: LOS \u22641 day (\u226424-hour short-stay), 2-4 days, 5-6 days, and \u22657 days. Primary outcomes were 30-day postoperative overall and serious morbidity. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality and readmission. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to explore the association between LOS and overall and serious morbidity. A total of 15,745 patients who underwent left colectomies for colon cancer were identified with 294 patients (1.87%) undergoing short-stay. Short-stay patients were generally younger and healthier with lower 30-day overall morbidity rates (LOS \u22641 day: 3.74%, LOS 2-4: 7.38%, LOS 5-6: 16.12%, and LOS \u22657: 37.64%, p<0.001). Compared to patients with LOS 2-4 days, no differences in mortality and readmission rates were observed. On adjusted analysis, there was no statistical difference in the odds of overall (LOS 2-4 days OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.01-3.60, p=0.049) and serious morbidity (LOS 2-4 days OR 0.86, 95% CI 1.42-1.76, p=0.672) between the short-stay and LOS 2-4 days groups. Although currently performed at low rates in the U.S., short-stay left colectomy is safe for a select group of patients. Attention to patient selection, refinement of clinical pathways, and close follow-up may enable short-stay colectomies to become a more feasile reality.",

They are regarded as cost-effective, and their use in healthcare is prioritized by many countries. However, the constant evolution of these technologies has led to an abundance of related literature. Thus, we conducted an umbrella review to identify and characterize digital supportive care interventions for patients with cancer and their relatives. A preregistered umbrella review was conducted (PROSPERO registration number CRD42022333110). Five databases were searched (Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library). To be considered, studies had to be systematic reviews or meta-analyses, be performed on pediatric or adult patients with cancer or survivors or their relatives, report results on web-based or app-based supportive care interventions, and measure psychological, functional, or behavioral variables or quality of life related to cancer. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Twenty eligible studies were identified. Most of the included studies reported results from adult patients with cancer. Globally, digital interventions were shown to be effective for physical activity in patients with cancer but had mixed results regarding emotional outcomes and quality of life. Additionally, a lack of methodological quality was noted for most of the included reviews. Digital supportive care interventions could be an effective tool in cancer care for some outcomes. Recommendations have been formulated for further research in this field using adapted methodologies for the development of digital health interventions.",

However, due to the relatively small proportion of the pancreas in the abdomen and significant shape and size variations, pancreatic tumor segmentation poses considerable challenges. To construct a network model that combines a pyramid pooling module with Inception architecture and SE attention mechanism (PIS-Unet), and observe its effectiveness in pancreatic tumor images segmentation, thereby providing supportive recommendations for clinical practitioners. A total of 303 patients with histologically confirmed pancreatic cystic neoplasm (PCN), including serous cystic neoplasm (SCN) and mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), from Shanghai Changhai Hospital between March 2011 and November 2021 were included. A total of 1792 T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) slices were used to build a CNN model. The model employed a pyramid pooling Inception module with a fused attention mechanism. The attention mechanism enhanced the network's focus on local features, while the Inception module and pyramid pooling allowed the network to extract features at different scales and improve the utilization efficiency of global information, thereby effectively enhancing network performance. Using three-fold cross-validation, the model constructed by us achieved a dice score of 85.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.02 for SCN images segmentation, and a dice score of 87.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.19 for MCN images segmentation.

        "AbstractText": "The cellular stress and immunity cycle is a cornerstone of organismal homeostasis. Stress activates intracellular and intercellular communications within a tissue or organ to initiate adaptive responses aiming to resolve the origin of this stress. If such local measures are unable to ameliorate this stress, then intercellular communications expand toward immune activation with the aim of recruiting immune cells to effectively resolve the situation while executing tissue repair to ameliorate any damage and facilitate homeostasis. This cellular stress-immunity cycle is severely dysregulated in diseased contexts like cancer. On one hand, cancer cells dysregulate the normal cellular stress responses to reorient them toward upholding growth at all costs, even at the expense of organismal integrity and homeostasis. On the other hand, the tumors severely dysregulate or inhibit various components of organismal immunity, for example, by facilitating immunosuppressive tumor landscape, lowering antigenicity, and increasing T-cell dysfunction. In this review we aim to comprehensively discuss the basis behind tumoral dysregulation of cellular stress-immunity cycle. We also offer insights into current understanding of the regulators and deregulators of this cycle and how they can be targeted for conceptualizing successful cancer immunotherapy regimen.",

        "AbstractText": "As a key regulator of development, organ size, tissue homeostasis and cancer, the Hippo pathway is tightly regulated by various growth-related signaling events. Among them, energy stress activates the Hippo pathway to inhibit its downstream effector YAP1. Our recent work reported a YAP1-independent role of the Hippo pathway in promoting macroautophagy/autophagy and cell survival in response to energy stress, a process mediated by Hippo kinase MAP4K2. MAP4K2 interacts with and phosphorylates MAP1LC3A/LC3A at S87, which in turn drives autophagosome-lysosome fusion via the RAB3GAP-RAB18 axis. Energy stress activates MAP4K2 by reducing its association with the Hippo phosphatase complex STRIPAK component STRN4. Moreover, MAP4K2 is highly expressed in head and neck cancer, while MAP4K2 and its mediated autophagy are required for head and neck cancer development. Taken together, our study not only reveals a noncanonical role of the Hippo pathway in energy stress response, but also suggests Hippo kinase MAP4K2 as a potential therapeutic target for head and neck cancer treatment.",

Furthermore, a comprehensive characterization of the nanoparticles along with an exploration of their physicochemical attributes was conducted. The biological functionalities of the synthesized nanoparticles were investigated through a thorough examination of their interaction with calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) using diverse spectroscopic techniques encompassing ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and fluorescence spectroscopy at varying temperatures. Subsequently, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of the magnetic nanoparticles using a colorectal cancer cell model (HCT116 cells) and a tetrazolium colorimetric assay (MTT assay). The characterization of the ginger extract-coated magnetic nanoparticles (ginger-Sm-MNPs) revealed their superparamagnetic nature, nanocrystalline structure, spherical morphology, hydrodynamic size of 155\u2009nm, and uniform distribution. The outcomes from UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy affirmed the binding of ginger-Sm-MNPs with ctDNA. Additionally, the MTT assay demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of ginger-Sm-MNPs surpassed that of both magnetite nanoparticles and ginger extract. Notably, the inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the green-synthesized nanoparticles after 24 and 48\u2009h of incubation were determined as 198.1 and 135.8\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively.

We assessed the prevalence of coding and splice variants in genes on the ACMG Secondary Findings, version 3.0 (ACMG SF v3.0), list in the genomes of 57,933 Icelanders. We assigned pathogenicity to all reviewed variants using reported evidence in the ClinVar database, the frequency of variants, and their associations with disease to create a manually curated set of actionable genotypes (variants). We assessed the relationship between these genotypes and life span and further examined the specific causes of death among carriers. Through manual curation of 4405 sequence variants in the ACMG SF v3.0 genes, we identified 235 actionable genotypes in 53 genes. Of the 57,933 participants, 2306 (4.0%) carried at least one actionable genotype. We found shorter median survival among persons carrying actionable genotypes than among noncarriers. Specifically, we found that carrying an actionable genotype in a cancer gene was associated with survival that was 3 years shorter than that among noncarriers, with causes of death among carriers attributed primarily to cancer-related conditions. Furthermore, we found evidence of association between carrying an actionable genotype in certain genes in the cardiovascular disease group and a reduced life span. On the basis of the ACMG SF v3.0 guidelines, we found that approximately 1 in 25 Icelanders carried an actionable genotype and that carrying such a genotype was associated with a reduced life span.

They regulate gene expression by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone tails, leading to chromatin condensation. A hydrazide-based HDAC inhibitor, N-(4-(2-Propylhydrazine-1-carbonyl)benzyl)-1H-indole-2-carboxamide (11h), has been reported to exhibit significant in\u00a0vivo antitumor activity. In comparison to the lead compound N-(4-(2-Propylhydrazine-1-carbonyl)benzyl)cinnamamide (17), compound 11h demonstrates 2- to 5-fold higher HDAC inhibition and cell-based antitumor activity. However, the inhibitory mechanism of 11h remains insufficiently explored. In this study, we conducted 500\u2009ns Gaussian Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (GaMD) simulations on Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and two complex systems (HDAC3-17 and HDAC3-11h). Our findings revealed that upon inhibitor binding, the active pocket volume of HDAC3 undergone alterations, and the movement of the L6-loop toward the active site impeded substrate entry. Moreover, we observed a destabilization of the \u03b1-helix in the aa75-89 region of HDAC3 compared to the two complex systems, indicating partial unwinding. Notably, 11h exhibited a closer proximity of its carbonyl oxygen to the active pocket's Zn2+ metal compared to 17, increasing the likelihood of coordination with the Zn2+ metal. The analysis of protein-ligand interactions highlighted a greater number of hydrogen bonds and other interactions between 11h and the receptor protein when compared to 17, underscoring the stronger binding of 11h to HDAC3.

Data was collected on 40 patients from 14 institutions. Twenty-one patients (52.5%) had a positive COVID-19 test within 10\u2009days before surgery and 7\u2009days after surgery. The remaining patients had a positive test earlier than 10\u2009days before surgery. A positive test caused a delay in surgery for 16 patients (40.0%) with an average delay of 44.7\u2009days (9-198\u2009days). Two free flap complications (5.0%) occurred with no free flap deaths. Four patients (10.0%) had surgical complications and 10 patients had medical complications (25.0%). Five patients (12.5%) suffered from postoperative COVID-19 pneumonia. Three deaths were COVID-19-related and one from cancer recurrence during the study period. Despite the heightened risk of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients, head and neck free flap reconstructions in patients with COVID-19 are not at higher risk for free flap complications. However, these patients are at increased risk of medical complications. 4 Laryngoscope, 2023.",

        "AbstractText": "In older patients with cancer, comorbidities compete with cancer for cause of death. The objectives were to evaluate cancer mortality and factors associated, according to metastatic status. Between 2007 and 2014, patients with cancer aged \u226570 referred for pre-therapeutic geriatric assessment (GA) were included through the ELCAPA prospective cohort study. The underlying cause of death was defined according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The World Health Organisation definition was used to categorise the cause of death as cancer versus another disease (e.g. cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, etc.) Competing risk models were used. Mean (SD) age of the 1445 included patients was 80.2 (5.8) and 48% were women. Most common tumour sites were colorectal (19%), breast (17%) and urinary (15%); 773 patients (49%) had metastases. After a 34-month median follow-up, 706 cancer deaths were observed among 843 deaths. The 6-month and 3-year cancer mortality rates (95% CI) were 12% (9-15) and 34% (29-38) for non-metastatic patients and 43% (39-47) and 79% (75-82) for metastatic patients, respectively. Dependency in activities of daily living and comorbidities were associated with 6-month and 3-year cancer mortality in non-metastatic (adjusted subhazard ratio [aSHR]\u2009=\u20091.68 [0.99-2.85] and 1.69 [1.16-2.45]; and 1.98 [1.08-3.63] and 3.38 [1.47-7.76], respectively) and metastatic patients (aSHR\u2009=\u20092.81 [2.01-3.93] and 2.95 [2.14-4.07]; and 1.63 [1.18-2.25] and 2.06 [1.39-3.05], respectively). Impaired Timed-Get-Up-and-Go test was associated with 6-month and 3-year cancer mortality in metastatic patients (aSHR\u2009=\u20091.5 [1.06-2.12] and 1.38 [1.06-1.81], respectively). Obesity was negatively associated with 3-year cancer death in non-metastatic (aSHR\u2009=\u20090.53 [0.29-0.97]) and metastatic patients (aSHR\u2009=\u20090.71 [0.51-1.00]). The majority of older adults with cancer referred for pre-therapeutic GA die from cancer. Geriatric parameters are independently associated with cancer mortality and should be considered for prognosis assessment, decision-making and care.",

This study aimed to identify antecedents contributing to caregivers' decisions to vaccinate CCS aged 5-17\u2009years against COVID-19 by applying the Theory of Planned Behavior. Participants in this cross-sectional study completed an online survey assessing caregiver attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intention to vaccinate CCS, CCS vaccination status, COVID-19 health literacy, and frequency of COVID-19 information-seeking. Surveys were completed between May and June 2022 following approval for the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines among children aged \u22655\u2009years in the U.S. Data were analyzed using unadjusted linear regressions and structural equation modeling. Participants were caregivers (n\u2009=\u2009160, 87.5% biological mothers, 75.6% white/non-Hispanic) of CCS (n\u2009=\u2009160, 44.4% female, mean (M)\u2009=\u200912.5\u2009years old, M\u2009=\u20098.0\u2009years off treatment). 70.0% (n\u2009=\u2009112) of caregivers and 53.8% (n\u2009=\u200986) of CCS received a COVID-19 vaccine.

        "AbstractText": "Sarcoids are common mesenchymal neoplasms of horses. Although there are few studies in which sarcoids have been followed over a long period of time, sarcoids are considered locally invasive and have been reported to frequently recur following surgical excision. Currently, no histological features have been identified to predict which sarcoids will recur after excision. The present study comprised 49 sarcoids for which histology sections were available and in which the recurrence status of the case was known. Each sarcoid was excised from a different horse. Overall, 12 of the 49 (24%) sarcoids recurred after surgical excision. Mitotic count (MC), cellularity, necrosis, nuclear pleomorphism, and inflammation of the sarcoids were evaluated histologically. Of these, MC correlated with recurrence. Four of 5 (80%) sarcoids with an MC \u2265 20 in 2.37 mm2 recurred, which was a significantly higher recurrence rate than that of sarcoids with an MC < 20, 8 of 44 cases recurred (18%), P = .0051. Clinical type was also found to correlate with recurrence. Three of 4 (75%) fibroblastic types recurred, which was a significantly higher recurrence rate than that of sarcoids with other clinical types, 9 of 45 cases (18%), P < .001. In addition, univariate Cox regression analysis confirmed fibroblastic type and MC \u2265 20 as significant predictors for recurrence (P = .016 and P = .005, respectively). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first large study examining recurrence rates in sarcoids, and the first time that histological features have been correlated with recurrence.",

        "AbstractText": "As an important biomarker, microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in gene expression, and their detection has attracted increasing attention. In this study, a DNAzyme walker that could provide power to perform autonomous movement was designed. Based on the continuous mechanical motion characteristics of DNAzyme walker, a miRNA detection strategy for the self-assembly of AuNPs induced by the hairpin probe-guided DNAzyme walker \"enzyme cleavage and walk\" was established. In this strategy, DNAzyme walker continuously cleaved and walked on the hairpin probe on the surface of AuNPs to induce the continuous shedding of some segments of the hairpin probe. The remaining hairpin sequences on the surface of the AuNP pair with each other, causing the nanoparticles to self-assemble. This strategy uses the autonomous movement mechanism of DNAzyme walker to improve reaction efficiency and avoid the problem of using expensive and easily degradable proteases. Secondly, using dynamic light scattering technology as the signal output system, ultra-sensitive detection with a detection limit of 3.6 fM is achieved. In addition, this strategy has been successfully used to analyze target miRNAs in cancer cell samples.",

        "AbstractText": "The transcription of the mitochondrial genome is pivotal for maintenance of mitochondrial functions, and the deregulated mitochondrial transcriptome contributes to various pathological changes. Despite substantial progress having been achieved in uncovering the transcriptional complexity of the nuclear transcriptome, many unknowns and controversies remain for the mitochondrial transcriptome, partially owing to the lack of a highly efficient mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) sequencing and analysis approach. Here, we first comprehensively evaluated the influence of essential experimental protocols, including strand-specific library construction, two RNA enrichment strategies, and optimal rRNA depletion, on accurately profiling mitochondrial transcriptome in whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS) data. Based on these insights, we developed a highly efficient approach specifically suitable for targeted sequencing of whole mitochondrial transcriptome, termed capture-based mtRNA seq (CAP), in which strand-specific library construction and optimal rRNA depletion were applied. Compared with WTS, CAP has a great decrease of required data volume without affecting the sensitivity and accuracy of detection. In addition, CAP also characterized the unannotated mt-tRNA transcripts whose expression levels are below the detection limits of conventional WTS. As a proof-of-concept characterization of mtRNAs, the transcription initiation sites and mtRNA cleavage ratio were accurately identified in CAP data. Moreover, CAP had very reliable performance in plasma and single-cell samples, highlighting its wide application. Altogether, the present study has established a highly efficient pipeline for targeted sequencing of mtRNAs, which may pave the way toward functional annotation of mtRNAs and mtRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in various diseases.",

Principal component analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, and uniform manifold approximation and projection are commonly used for data visualization. However, these methods can be challenging for students without a strong mathematical background. In this study, intuitive examples were created using COVID-19 data to help students understand the core concepts behind these techniques. In a 4-h practical session, we used these examples to demonstrate dimensionality reduction techniques to 15 postgraduate students from biomedical backgrounds. Using Python and Jupyter notebooks, our goal was to demystify these methods, typically treated as \"black boxes\", and empower students to generate and interpret their own results. To assess the impact of our approach, we conducted an anonymous survey. The majority of the students agreed that using computers enriched their learning experience (67%) and that Jupyter notebooks were a valuable part of the class (66%). Additionally, 60% of the students reported increased interest in Python, and 40% gained both interest and a better understanding of dimensionality reduction methods. Despite the short duration of the course, 40% of the students reported acquiring research skills necessary in the field. While further analysis of the learning impacts of this approach is needed, we believe that sharing the examples we generated can provide valuable resources for others to use in interactive teaching environments. These examples highlight advantages and limitations of the major dimensionality reduction methods used in modern bioinformatics analysis in an easy-to-understand way.",

A prospective observational study was conducted under the STROBE guidelines. Data were collected from June to September 2022. Statistical analyses were performed to compare each reason for care calls, by shifts and pre and post-inpatient bed modernization. Two thousand five hundred and fifty-nine care request calls were analysed during the 202 observed shifts. The most frequent reason was related to the requests for positions. Technological modernization of the beds has not led to effective-positive-changes; on the contrary, it seems at first glance to show an upward trend in calls above all in the short period after the changes. What problem did the study address? By analysing the principal causes of care calls and comparing the differences before and after inpatient beds' technological modernization, this study evaluates if inpatient gear or device modernization can impact care call requests. What were the main findings? The results show that the most frequent reasons for care calls were position, possession and other. These findings seem not superimposable; the hypothesis supported by the international literature in which the causes relating to potty and pain were found among the main reasons. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? These results could impact the care organizational area in nursing care and could improve care quality, patient satisfaction and safety.

        "AbstractText": "Glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is extremely challenging due to the high complexity of the tumor. It is one of the tumors in which a subpopulation of highly resistant glioma initiating cells (GICs) has been clearly identified. Thus, understanding the differences between GICs and tumor bulk cells is therefore essential to move to less conventional but more efficient approaches. It was found that, unlike their differentiated progeny, GICs survival and maintenance of stem cell properties depend on mitochondrial metabolism. GICs present higher glucose uptake and mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced lactate dehydrogenase activity, being more sensitive to mitochondrial inhibition than their differentiated counterparts. Calcium flux to the mitochondria appears to play an essential role in the maintenance of this distinct metabolic phenotype with a decrease in the expression of voltage\u2011dependent anionic channel (VDAC) and Grp75, two of the proteins of the IP3R\u2011Grp75\u2011VDAC complex that transfers calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the mitochondria. Disruption of ER homeostasis using ER stress inducers or inhibition of ER\u2011mitochondrial contact sites using the Grp75 inhibitor MKT\u2011077 resulted in cytotoxicity of GICs and loss of stemness. Moreover, MKT\u2011077 also potentiates the effect of temozolomide, current treatment for glioblastoma. In summary, the present data indicated that ER\u2011mitochondrial homeostasis is essential for regulation of GICs glucose metabolism and survival.",

Here, we demonstrate that the simultaneous inhibition of LOXL2 and BRD4 synergistically limits TNBC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LOXL2 interacts in the nucleus with the short isoform of BRD4 (BRD4S), MED1, and the cell cycle transcriptional regulator B-MyB. These interactions sustain the formation of BRD4 and MED1 nuclear transcriptional foci and control cell cycle progression at the gene expression level. The pharmacological co-inhibition of LOXL2 and BRD4 reduces BRD4 nuclear foci, BRD4-MED1 colocalization, and the transcription of cell cycle genes, thus suppressing TNBC cell proliferation.

Recent studies have highlighted that the Grb2\u2011associated binder 2 (Gab2) is a critical gene involved in the development of various types of tumor, including CRC. However, the precise role of Gab2 in mediating TAM polarization remains incompletely elucidated. In the present study, it was discovered that Gab2 was highly expressed within CRC tissue TAMs, and was associated with a poor prognosis of patients with CRC. Functionally, it was identified that the tumor\u2011conditioned medium (TCM) induced Gab2 expression, facilitating the TAMs towards an M2\u2011like phenotype polarization. Of note, the suppression of Gab2 expression using shRNA markedly inhibited the TCM\u2011induced expression of M2\u2011associated molecules, without affecting M1\u2011type markers. Furthermore, the xenotransplantation model demonstrated that Gab2 deficiency in TAMs inhibited tumor growth in the mouse model of CRC. Mechanistically, Gab2 induced the M2 polarization of TAMs by regulating\u00a0the AKT and ERK signaling pathways, promoting CRC growth and metastasis. In summary, the present study study elucidates that decreasing Gab2 expression hinders the transition of TAMs towards the M2 phenotype, thereby suppressing the growth of CRC. The exploration of the regulatory mechanisms of Gab2 in TAM polarization may enhance the current understanding of the core molecular pathways of CRC development and may thus provide a foundation for the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies targeted against TAMs.",

        "AbstractText": "Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is a major complication after lung transplantation that results from a complex interplay of innate inflammatory and alloimmune factors, culminating in parenchymal and/or obliterative airway fibrosis. Excessive IL-17A signaling and chronic inflammation have been recognized as key factors in these pathological processes. Herein, we developed a model of repeated airway inflammation in mouse minor alloantigen-mismatched single-lung transplantation. Repeated intratracheal LPS instillations augmented pulmonary IL-17A expression. LPS also increased acute rejection, airway epithelial damage, and obliterative airway fibrosis, similar to human explanted lung allografts with antecedent episodes of airway infection. We then investigated the role of donor and recipient IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) in this context. Donor IL-17RA deficiency significantly attenuated acute rejection and CLAD features, whereas recipient IL-17RA deficiency only slightly reduced airway obliteration in LPS allografts. IL-17RA immunofluorescence positive staining was greater in human CLAD lungs compared with control human lung specimens, with localization to fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, which was also seen in mouse LPS allografts. Taken together, repeated airway inflammation after lung transplantation caused local airway epithelial damage, with persistent elevation of IL-17A and IL-17RA expression and particular involvement of IL-17RA on donor structural cells in development of fibrosis.",

However, the precise mechanism by which Gln metabolism reprogramming promotes and coordinates KRAS-mutant CRC progression remains to be fully investigated. Here, we discovered that solute carrier 25 member 21 (SLC25A21) expression was downregulated in KRAS-mutant CRC, and that SLC25A21 downregulation was correlated with poor survival of KRAS-mutant CRC patients. SLC25A21 depletion selectively accelerated the growth, invasion, migration, and metastasis of KRAS-mutant CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, and inhibited Gln-derived \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) efflux from mitochondria, thereby potentiating Gln replenishment, accompanied by increased GTP availability for persistent KRAS activation in KRAS-mutant CRC. The restoration of SLC25A21 expression impaired the KRAS-mutation-mediated resistance to cetuximab in KRAS-mutant CRC. Moreover, the arrested \u03b1-KG efflux that occurred in response to SLC25A21 depletion inhibited the activity of \u03b1-KG-dependent DNA demethylases, resulting in a further decrease in SLC25A21 expression. Our studies demonstrate that SLC25A21 plays a significant role as a tumor suppressor in KRAS-mutant CRC by antagonizing Gln-dependent anaplerosis to limit GTP availability for KRAS activation, which suggests potential alternative therapeutic strategies for KRAS-mutant CRC.",

However, the therapeutic efficacy of PARPis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is still unknown. We explored the effect of a mutated retinoblastoma gene (RB1) on PARPi sensitivity in LUAD. Bioinformatic screening was performed to identify PARPi-sensitive biomarkers. Here, we showed that viability of LUAD cell lines with mutated RB1 was significantly decreased by PARPis (niraparib, rucaparib, and olaparib). RB1 deficiency induced genomic instability, prompted cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) formation, activated the cGAS/STING pathway, and upregulated downstream chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10, triggering immune cell infiltration. Xenograft experiments indicated that PARPi treatment reduced tumorigenesis in RB1-KO mice. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed that malignant cells with downregulated expression of RB1 had more communications with other cell types, exhibiting activation of specific signaling such as GAS, IFN response, and antigen-presenting and cytokine activities. Our findings suggest that RB1 mutation mediates the sensitivity to PARPis through a synthetic lethal effect by triggering the cGAS/STING pathway and upregulation of immune infiltration in LUAD, which may be a potential therapeutic strategy.",

Pretreatment with DFO induced antioxidant activity and alleviated lipid peroxidation\u2011mediated HHIBD. In addition, PC12 cells treated with ferric ammonium citrate showed shrinking mitochondria, high mitochondrial membrane density, and increased lipid reactive oxygen species and intracellular ferrous iron, which were antagonized by pretreatment with ferrostatin\u20111 or DFO, which was reversed by pretreatment with ferrostatin\u20111 or DFO. The present study demonstrated that ferroptosis is involved in HHIBD and provided novel insights into candidate proteins that are potentially involved in ferroptosis in the brain during hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia.",

        "AbstractText": "Kr\u00fcppel\u2011like factor 4 (KLF4) is a transcription factor which functions as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene in numerous types of solid tumors. However, its expression levels and function in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA) have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, in order to investigate its roles in pCCA, reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR (RT\u2011qPCR), western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to detect KLF4 expression in pCCA. The Chi\u2011squared test was used to analyze the associations between KLF4 and the clinicopathological features of patients with pCCA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were subsequently used to analyze the prognostic significance of KLF4. The tumor suppression of KLF4 was investigated for the purposes of illustrating its biological function both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Furthermore, the association between KLF4 and growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was determined using pCCA tissue microarray (TMA) analysis and RT\u2011qPCR. The underlying molecular mechanisms between KLF4 and GDF15 were subsequently investigated in\u00a0vitro. In pCCA tissues, KLF4 was found to be downregulated, and this was negatively associated with the histological grade and tumor size. The knockdown of KLF4 was also found to be a prognostic indicator of the poorer survival of patients with pCCA. Based on in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo analyses, KLF4 was found to suppress tumor progression and induce cell apoptosis. Furthermore, it was found that KLF4 executed its tumor suppressive effects via the regulation of the GDF15/AKT signaling pathway. Taken together, the findings of the present study demonstrate that KLF4 may be considered as an independent biomarker of a favorable prognosis of patients with pCCA, and the KLF4/GDF15/AKT signaling pathway may potentially be a novel molecular therapeutic target for patients with pCCA.",

        "AbstractText": "Numerous successful gene-targeted therapies are arising for the treatment of a variety of rare diseases. At the same time, current treatment options for neurofibromatosis 1 and schwannomatosis are limited and do not directly address loss of gene/protein function. In addition, treatments have mostly focused on symptomatic tumors, but have failed to address multisystem involvement in these conditions. Gene-targeted therapies hold promise to address these limitations. However, despite intense interest over decades, multiple preclinical and clinical issues need to be resolved before they become a reality. The optimal approaches to gene-, mRNA-, or protein restoration and to delivery to the appropriate cell types remain elusive. Preclinical models that recapitulate manifestations of neurofibromatosis 1 and schwannomatosis need to be refined. The development of validated assays for measuring neurofibromin and merlin activity in animal and human tissues will be critical for early-stage trials, as will the selection of appropriate patients, based on their individual genotypes and risk/benefit balance. Once the safety of gene-targeted therapy for symptomatic tumors has been established, the possibility of addressing a wide range of symptoms, including non-tumor manifestations, should be explored. As preclinical efforts are underway, it will be essential to educate both clinicians and those affected by neurofibromatosis 1/schwannomatosis about the risks and benefits of gene-targeted therapy for these conditions.",

In some clinical trials, such as pain management studies, the efficacy endpoint of interest is measured longitudinally. We propose a Bayesian phase II design for such clinical trials. We model the longitudinal measurement process using Bayesian hierarchical model, where subject-specific trajectory shrinks toward the population trajectory to borrow information across subjects. The Bayesian penalized spline is used to model subject-specific and population trajectories without making strong parametric assumption on their shapes. We use the area under the curve of the trajectory as the summary of the treatment effect over time. The design takes a group sequential approach and takes into account both statistical significance and clinical relevance. Bayesian criteria is proposed to make interim and final decisions based on the evidence of statistical significance and clinical relevance. The proposed design is highly flexible and can accommodate trials with one or multiple longitudinal endpoints, as well as a longitudinal primary endpoint with a secondary endpoint. Simulation study shows that the proposed design is robust with desirable operating characteristics.",

Single-center retrospective cohort study that included patients treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4, including nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or the combination ipilimumab-nivolumab in metastatic neoplastic disease. The clinical effectiveness of ICI, measured in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), was compared between the PPI-use versus PPI-no-use group. PPI-use group was associated with lower PFS [hazard ratio (HR):1.89 (1.38-2.59), P<0.001] and OS [HR: 2.02 (1.45-2.82), P<0.001] versus PPI-no-use group.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, and numerous methods have been tested and used to figure out an optimum way of treatment. Besides targeted therapy, immunotherapy has proven to be effective by controlling certain immune cells. Traditional cancer therapy is met with the consequences of adverse side effects that have been a major issue for treatment; hence, a leap towards naturally occurring immunomodulators was taken to develop safer methods of treatment. One of the major immune cells responsible for the growth of tumors is regulatory T cells (Tregs). To maintain immunological homeostasis, Treg dampens abnormal immune responses to self and non-self-antigens. The transcription factor FoxP3 is responsible for their lineage specification and takes part in the production of immunosuppressive cytokines like IL10, IL35, and TGFb. This helps cancer cells to proliferate without the restriction of different immune cells like CD8+T cells, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, B cells, and natural killer cells. Hence, targeting Tregs to provide unhindered immunosurveillance has proven to be a breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy. This review mainly focuses on some common naturally occurring immunomodulators derived from plant products that have earned their place as immunotherapeutic agents, along with some of their ability to suppress Tregs that can be used as an effective way to treat cancer.",

Cancer patients are at greater risk of serious complications and death because of COVID-19 infection. The purpose of the present study was to determine cancer patients' attitudes toward the anti-COVID-19 vaccine. We examined several constructs that potentially influenced cancer patients' perceptions of the vaccine: health status, knowledge of COVID-19 and vaccination, cancer patients' perceptions of vulnerability, and attitudes toward general vaccines. We conducted a collective case study with 200 cancer patients undergoing treatment, and divided the sample into two groups: patients who \"expected to heal\" (Group A) and patients who \"expected to chronicize\" (Group B). Data were collected through a purpose-built questionnaire consisting of 22 questions and a study of medical records. Data analysis showed that both groups, Group A (M= 3.89 SD= 0.64) and Group B (M= 3.98 SD= 0.64), had a favorable attitude toward the anti-COVID-19 vaccine. This favorable attitude toward the anti-COVID-19 vaccine depended on several factors: perception of vulnerability to COVID-19, perception of the severity of their oncological situation, and communication with oncologists.

This study was, therefore, carried out to analyse the oncogene expressions in the lung tissue of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)-induced mice and compare between free ATRA and cationic liposome nanoformulation (lipo- ATRA) treatments. This study was designed to analyse the changes in the expression levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and B-Raf in the lung tissues of B[a]P-induced mice during the cancer development stage itself and to find the suppressive effect of free ATRA and lipo-ATRA. Lung cancer was induced in mice by oral ingestion of 50mg/kg body weight B[a]P weekly twice for four consecutive weeks. Then, the mice were treated with free and lipo-ATRA (0.60mg/kg) for 30 days via i.v injection. The EGFR and B-Raf gene expressions were analyzed in lung cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The RT-PCR gene band density and the relative quantity (RQ) values from qPCR revealed both EGFR and B-Raf genes to be significantly overexpressed in B[a]P control mice while having very low or no expression in normal mice. This indicates that they function as oncogenes in B[a]P-induced lung carcinogenesis. The lipo-ATRA treatment has shown a highly significant increase in RQ values for both EGFR and BRaf when compared to the free ATRA treatment. The study results have revealed the cationic lipo-ATRA treatment to have enhanced the bioavailability of ATRA in lung tissue due to its significant suppression action on EGFR-mediated oncogenes' expressions. Furthermore, the EGFR and BRaf could be the molecular targets of ATRA action in lung carcinogenesis.",

Globally, gastric cancer (GC) is third most common cause of cancer-related mortality and the fourth most common kind of cancer. Persistent infection of VacA-positive Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) modulates cellular physiology and leads to GC. About \u223c70% of H. pylori are positive for vacuolating cytotoxin-A (VacA), and it infects \u223c80-90% of world populations. Herein, for first time, we repurposed FDA-approved gram-negative antibiotics, which are feasible alternatives to existing regimens and may be used in combinatorial treatment against VacA-positive H. pylori. Out of 110 FDA-approved antibiotics, we retrieved 92 structures, which were screened against the VacA protein. Moreover, we determined that the top eight hit antibiotics viz; cefpiramide, cefiderocol, eravacycline, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, enoxacin, tedizolid, and cefamandole show binding free energies of -9.1, -8.9, -8.1, -8.0, -7.9, -7.8, -7.8 and -7.8\u2009Kcal/mol, respectively, with VacA protein. Finally, we performed 100\u2009ns duplicate MD simulations on the top eight selected antibiotics showing strong VacA binding. Subsequently, five antibiotics, including cefiderocol, cefpiramide, doxycycline, enoxacin, and tedizolid show stable ligand protein distance and good binding affinity revealed by the MM-PBSA scheme. Among the five antibiotics cefiderocol act as the most potent inhibitor (-28.33\u2009kcal/mol). Furthermore, we also identified the hotspot residue like Asn-506, Tyr-529, and Phe-483 which control the interaction.

A reduced percentage of monocytes with the CD14 + TLR4 + immunophenotype was correlated with a lower MFI level of CD18 and CD11b in the entire group of patients and after division only in the mild hypertension group. Reduced surface expression of TLR4 in hypertensive patients correlated with a lower number of CECs. This relationship was not observed in the resistant hypertension group; instead, an independent effect of reduced CD11b/CD18 expression on the reduction of CEC number was demonstrated. Our preliminary study showed for the first time that hypertension of varying severity is accompanied by phenotypic changes in monocytes, manifested by reduced surface expression of both TLR4 and CD11b/CD18. These phenotypic changes were associated with a reduced degree of endothelial injury. Our study opens a new, unexplored area of research on the protective features of peripheral monocytes in hypertension.",

        "AbstractText": "Since the inception of the interferon-free direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, guidelines as to who should receive this potentially curative treatment have evolved. Treatment with DAAs is now considered for all patients except for those considered moribund. To determine the DAA treatment rate for patients with HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This was a retrospective study from January 2015 to March 2021 of a national sample of privately insured patients with HCV-related HCC using Optum's Clinformatics\u00ae Data Mart (CDM) Database - a large, de-identified, adjudicated claims database. We identified 3922 patients with HCV-related HCC: 922 (23.5%) received DAA. Compared to untreated patients, DAA-treated patients were younger (65.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5 vs. 66.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5\u2009years, p\u2009<\u20090.001), more frequently saw a gastroenterology/infectious disease (GI/ID) physician (41.2% vs. 34.2%), and had decompensated cirrhosis (56% vs. 53%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). In multivariable analysis, younger age (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99, p\u2009<\u20090.001), GI/ID care (HR: 3.06, 95% CI: 2.13-4.51, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and having cirrhosis (compensated: HR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.18-2.21, p\u2009=\u20090.003; decompensated: HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.07-1.98, p\u2009=\u20090.02) were associated with receiving DAA treatment, but not sex, race, or ethnicity. DAA-treated patients had significantly higher 5-year survival than untreated patients (47.2% vs. 35.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Following adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and HCC treatment, receiving DAA treatment was associated with lower mortality (aHR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.53-0.69, p\u2009<\u20090.001). DAA treatment remains underutilised in insured patients with HCV-related HCC; fewer than one in four patients received treatment. Seeing a specialist and having decompensated cirrhosis were predictors for DAA treatment; additional efforts are needed to increase awareness of HCV treatment.",

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in patients with advanced PPGL, based on a single-institution experience and provide a comprehensive review of the literature. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with advanced pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma who received PRRT at a single institution from April 2012 to March 2022. Clinical characteristics, treatment response, adverse events, and survival outcomes were assessed. A systematic literature review was also performed. A total of 15 patients with advanced PPGL were included, the majority of whom had both metastatic and functional disease. Most patients received four infusions of 177Lu-DOTATATE (73%). The median therapeutic 177Lu-DOTATATE radioactivity for each infusion was 7.4\u2009GBq. Only one patient was treated with one infusion of 90Y-DOTATATE (4.2\u2009GBq) in addition to three infusions of Lu-177 DOTATATE. Overall, PRRT suggests a promising efficacy with disease control rate of 63.6% by RECIST v1.1. The median overall survival (OS) was not reached and the median progression free survival (PFS) was 25.9\u2009months. In terms of safety, PRRT was well tolerated. Review of the literature revealed consistent findings, supporting the efficacy and safety of PRRT in PPGL. This study suggests that PRRT is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with PPGL. Our findings align with the existing literature, providing additional evidence to support the use of PRRT in this challenging patient population.",

Patients & methods: In this case-control study, patients undergoing breast surgery with 'enhanced recovery after surgery' pathways were divided into group 1 (57 patients) in whom PECS was performed before general anesthesia, and group 2 (57 patients) in whom only general anesthesia was effected. Results: Postoperative opioid consumption (p\u00a0<\u00a00.002), pain at 32 h after surgery (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) and the length of stay (p\u00a0<\u00a00.003) were significantly lower in group 1. Conclusion: Reducing opioid consumption and pain after surgery, PECS could favor a faster recovery with a reduction in length of stay, ensuring a higher turnover of patients undergoing breast surgery. \u2018Enhanced recovery after surgery\u2019 (ERAS) protocols have been recently applied in breast cancer patients in order to improve the postoperative course. However, the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain after breast surgery is frequent and a multimodal approach is recommended. In this view, the interfascial plane blocks are advocated as a valid alternative to both paravertebral and epidural blockade. In this study, we evaluated the effects of these blocks on the postoperative course in patients undergoing breast surgery with ERAS protocols. We compared two patient groups: in the first, pectoral blocks were performed before general anesthesia, while in the second no block was carried out. We found that in the patient group receiving the blocks, postoperative opioid consumption (with essentially the same pain after surgery) and length of stay were significantly lower. Therefore, although more robust studies are needed to confirm our findings, these emerging locoregional techniques could favor a faster recovery in the context of ERAS in breast surgery. These results could have important clinical implications in terms of not only reducing healthcare costs but also ensuring a higher turnover of patients undergoing breast surgery.",

Materials and methods: Data were collected for patients treated with anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) monotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab; n\u00a0=\u00a0147) or nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n\u00a0=\u00a081) from 2015-2017 and followed for \u22653\u00a0years. Results: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus anti-PD-1 monotherapy was associated with a nonsignificantly lower risk of death (adjusted HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.54-1.28; p\u00a0=\u00a00.41), higher disease control rate (72\u00a0vs 56%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), and stable quality of life, but more grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (54\u00a0vs 26%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Conclusion: These results support the use of immuno-oncology therapy in advanced melanoma. Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, which are pigment cells that give the skin, hair, and other tissues their color. At advanced stages of spread, melanoma can be life-threatening. However, immunotherapy, a type of therapy that helps the body's immune system to destroy cancer cells, allows some patients with advanced melanoma to live longer. The OPTIMIzE study looked at how well patients with advanced melanoma did when treated with different immunotherapies. These patients were treated in a real-world setting, such as a doctor's office, and were not participating in a clinical trial. Compared with clinical trials, real-world studies like the OPTIMIzE study may include a more varied group of patients because of the less selective study enrollment requirements. In the OPTIMIzE study, patients were treated with either a single immunotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab alone) or a combination of two immunotherapies (nivolumab plus ipilimumab). Both single and combination immunotherapies were effective and tolerable. Patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab had greater tumor shrinkage than patients receiving nivolumab or pembrolizumab alone, but with more side effects from their treatment. Despite the occurrence of side effects with both single and combination immunotherapies, patients reported that their quality of life remained stable while being treated. The OPTIMIzE study shows that immunotherapy is effective and tolerable for patients with advanced melanoma in the real-world setting. This information may help doctors with selecting treatments for their patients with advanced melanoma. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT02780089 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

Furthermore, the prognosis and survival rate of GBM are still poor after surgical removal via conventional combination therapy. Owing to the existence of the formidable blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the aggressive, infiltrating nature of GBM growth, the diagnosis and treatment of GBM are quite challenging. Recently, liposomes and their derivatives have emerged as super cargos for the delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs for the treatment of glioblastoma because of their advantages, such as biocompatibility, long circulation, and ease of physical and chemical modification, which facilitate the capability of targeting specific sites, circumvention of BBB transport restrictions, and amplification of the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we provide a timely update on the burgeoning liposome-based drug delivery systems and potential challenges in these fields for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Furthermore, we focus on the most recent liposome-based drug delivery cargos, including pH-sensitive, temperature-sensitive, and biomimetic liposomes, to enhance the multimodality in imaging and therapeutics of glioblastoma. Furthermore, we highlight the future difficulties and directions for the research and clinical translation of liposome-based drug delivery. Hopefully, this review will trigger the interest of researchers to expedite the development of liposome cargos and even their clinical translation for improving the prognosis of glioblastoma.",

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 parents of Japanese CCSs aged 16-25\u2009years. The data were then qualitatively analyzed using the modified grounded theory approach. Three \"categories\" and 20 \"concepts\" were generated. The connections among these categories and concepts revealed the parental involvement process regarding CCSs' independence while balancing their health management and social lives. The first phase in this process is to \"support careful behaviors,\" mainly during CCSs' treatment in the outpatient clinic or shortly after discharge. As CCSs recover after cancer treatment, parents \"watch over, but feel conflicted,\" with \"conflicts between protecting their sons/daughters and giving them independence.\" Then, parents reach a phase in which they \"acknowledge and entrust,\" which includes \"acknowledgment of development and efforts\" of their sons/daughters, and develop an \"attitude to entrust medical checkups to their sons/daughters, along with their preparation.\" The influencing factors of the three phases include \"ongoing anxieties about the late effects of therapy and recurrence\" and an \"expectation for their sons/daughters to acquire abilities for living independently.\" These findings suggest that nurses need to accept parents' feelings and thoughts regarding conflicts with CCSs, recognition of CCSs' development, and values.

It seems that several regulatory genes and signaling pathways are associated with the emergence of the chemo-resistant phenotype. Here, a meta-analysis approach was adopted to assess deregulated genes involved in relapse after the first line of chemotherapy (cisplatin). To do so, six ovarian cancer libraries were gathered from GEO repository. Batch effect removal and quality assessment, and boxplots and PCA were performed using SVA and ggplot2 packages in R, respectively. Cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive ovarian cancer groups were compared with find genes with significant expression changes using linear regression models in the LIMMA R package. The significance threshold for DEGs was taken as adj p-value <\u2009.05 and\u2009-\u20091\u2009>\u2009logFC\u2009>\u20091. A total of 261 genes were identified to have significant differential expression levels in the cisplatin-resistant versus cisplatin-sensitive group. Among the 10 top up-regulated and down-regulated genes, PITX2, SNCA, and EPHA7 (up), as well as TMEM98 (down) are indirect upstream regulators of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, contributing greatly to the development of chemo-resistance in cancer via promoting cell proliferation, survival, and cell cycle progression as well as inhibiting apoptosis. Moreover, a comprehensive assessment of DEGs revealed the dysregulation of not only membrane ion channels KCa1.1, Kv4, and CACNB4, affecting cell excitability, proliferation, and apoptosis but also cell adhesion proteins COL4A6, EPHA3, and CD9, affecting the attachment of normal cells to ECM and apoptosis, introducing good options to reverse cisplatin resistance. Our results predict and suggest that upstream regulators of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, ion channels, and cell adhesion proteins play important roles in cisplatin resistance development in ovarian cancer.",

The most effective individualized chemotherapy regimens were ifosfamide + pirarubicin + etoposide + carboplatin (54.84%), followed by pirubicin + cyclophosphamide + cisplatin (16.13%), ifosfamide + carboplatin + etoposide (12.90%), cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil + vincristine + adriamycin (12.90%), and vincristine + irinotecan + cyclophosphamide + cisplatin (3.23%). Using the MiniPDX model to screen individualized chemotherapy regimens for pediatric hepatoblastoma can significantly improve the CR rate.",

        "AbstractText": "The diverse bacterial populations within the symbiotic microbiota play a pivotal role in both health and disease. Microbiota modulates critical aspects of tumor biology including cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. This regulation occurs through mechanisms like enhancing genomic damage, hindering gene repair, activating aberrant cell signaling pathways, influencing tumor cell metabolism, promoting revascularization, and remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment. These microbiota-mediated effects significantly impact overall survival and the recurrence of tumors after surgery by affecting the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy. Moreover, leveraging the microbiota for the development of biovectors, probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, in addition to utilizing antibiotics, dietary adjustments, defensins, oncolytic virotherapy, and fecal microbiota transplantation, offers promising alternatives for cancer treatment. Nonetheless, due to the extensive and diverse nature of the microbiota, along with tumor heterogeneity, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of microbiota in cancer remain a subject of intense debate. In this context, we refocus on various cancers, delving into the molecular signaling pathways associated with the microbiota and its derivatives, the reshaping of the tumor microenvironmental matrix, and the impact on tolerance to tumor treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This exploration aims to shed light on novel perspectives and potential applications in the field.",

        "AbstractText": "Metformin has been used to treat cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and mounting studies have shown that metformin can act alone or in synergy with other anticancer agents to achieve anti-cancer efficacies on various types of tumors. However, the role of metformin in either inducing autophagy and cisplatin-resistance of human gastric cancer (GC) cells has never been examined. The study has established a cisplatin-resistant GC cell line and investigated the effects of metformin on inducing autophagy on it. The results demonstrated that treatment with metformin can concentration-dependently suppress the cell viability and cell confluence of cisplatin-resistant GC cells, while having no effects on human primary stomach epithelial cells (HPSEC). For the first time, we found that metformin can significantly increase the acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) level and decrease the acridine orange (AO) level spontaneously in the cisplatin-resistant GC cells. Thus, we further checked the other markers, Atg5, Atg12 and LC3-II, which showed that metformin indeed induced autophagy in the cisplatin-resistant GC cells. In addition, treatment of 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) can significantly rescue the metformin-induced autophagy. At the same time, metformin can induce the alterations of apoptosis-associated signal molecules, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities. Overall, the pilot study provided evidence for metformin induced autophagy in addition to apoptosis, making it as an effective anticancer drug for the therapy of cisplatin-resistant GC. Killing the cisplatin-resistant GC cells with non-toxic metformin via both autophagy and apoptosis might extend its usefulness in our fighting with chemo-resistance of gastric cancer cells.",

Brain tumors are difficult to treat and lead to poor prognosis and survival in patients. Gliomas are categorized into four different grades among which GBM is the worst grade primary brain tumor with a survival of less than a year. The genomic heterogeneity of the brain tumor results in different profiles for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma. Precision medicine focuses on this specific tumor type and suggests specialized treatment for better prognosis and overall survival (OS). With the recent advancements in Genome-Wide Studies (GWS) and various characterizations of brain tumors based on genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and metabolomics, this review discusses the advancements and opportunities of precision medicine therapeutics, drugs, and diagnosis methods based on the different profiles of glioblastoma. This review has exhaustively surveyed several pieces of works from various literature databases. It is evident that most primary brain tumors including glioblastoma require specific and precision therapeutics for better prognosis and OS.

However, more convenient methods are always encouraged. Radial arterial waves that are used to detect cardiovascular changes can be used to assist in confirming cardiovascular changes. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the frequency and time domains of the radial artery pulse wave in patients with breast cancer to understand its effectiveness in identifying cardiovascular changes. Patients with breast cancer were screened from the pulse examination records in Changhua Christian Hospital and divided into the treatment and remission groups. After unlinking the data, the pulse data were analyzed for the breast cancer treatment and remission group, including the average value of the parameters of four consecutive pulse diagnosis records in four consecutive months to test the difference in pulse waves due to breast cancer treatment between the two groups. Additionally, the pulse wave stability of the two groups was compared using the coefficient of variation. The comparison of the pulse wave data between 19 patients in the treatment group and 40 patients in the remission group revealed 45 parameters in time and 50 in frequency domains. D3, ND3, NA1, and NT1 are the four parameters with significant differences (p < 0.05), which are all related to heart function, and mainly related to cardiac output and peripheral resistance, indicating that patients in the treatment period have poor heart function. No difference was found in the degree of data dispersion between the two groups. Cardiovascular side effects caused by breast cancer treatment can mainly be shown in the pulse wave time domain.",

        "AbstractText": "Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is used in interventional radiology (IR) for identification of complex vascular anatomy, difficult to visualize in 2D fluoroscopy. However, long acquisition time makes CBCT susceptible to soft-tissue deformable motion that degrades visibility of fine vessels. We propose a targeted framework to compensate for deformable intra-scan motion via learned full-sequence models for identification of vascular anatomy coupled to an autofocus function specifically tailored to vascular imaging. The vessel-targeted autofocus acts in two stages: (i) identification of vascular and catheter targets in the projection domain; and, (ii) autofocus optimization for a 4D vector field through an objective function that quantifies vascular visibility. Target identification is based on a deep learning model that operates on the complete sequence of projections, via a transformer encoder-decoder architecture that uses spatial-temporal self-attention modules to infer long-range feature correlations, enabling identification of vascular anatomy with highly variable conspicuity. The vascular autofocus function is derived through eigenvalues of the local image Hessian, which quantify the local image structure for identification of bright tubular structures. Motion compensation was achieved via spatial transformer operators that impart time dependent deformations to NPAR = 90 partial angle reconstructions, allowing for efficient minimization via gradient backpropagation. The framework was trained and evaluated in synthetic abdominal CBCTs obtained from liver MDCT volumes and including realistic models of contrast-enhanced vascularity with 15 to 30 end branches, 1 - 3.5 mm vessel diameter, and 1400 HU contrast. The targeted autofocus resulted in qualitative and quantitative improvement in vascular visibility in both simulated and clinical intra-procedural CBCT. The transformer-based target identification module resulted in superior detection of target vascularity and a lower number of false positives, compared to a baseline U-Net model acting on individual projection views, reflected as a 1.97x improvement in intersection-over-union values. Motion compensation in simulated data yielded improved conspicuity of vascular anatomy, and reduced streak artifacts and blurring around vessels, as well as recovery of shape distortion. These improvements amounted to an average 147% improvement in cross correlation computed against the motion-free ground truth, relative to the un-compensated reconstruction. Targeted autofocus yielded improved visibility of vascular anatomy in abdominal CBCT, providing better potential for intra-procedural tracking of fine vascular anatomy in 3D images. The proposed method poses an efficient solution to motion compensation in task-specific imaging, with future application to a wider range of imaging scenarios.",

        "AbstractText": "To improve segmentation accuracy in head and neck cancer (HNC) radiotherapy treatment planning for the 1.5T hybrid magnetic resonance imaging/linear accelerator (MR-Linac), three-dimensional (3D), T2-weighted, fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging sequences were developed and optimized. After initial testing, spectral attenuated inversion recovery (SPAIR) was chosen as the fat suppression technique. Five candidate SPAIR sequences and a nonsuppressed, T2-weighted sequence were acquired for five HNC patients using a 1.5T MR-Linac. MR physicists identified persistent artifacts in two of the SPAIR sequences, so the remaining three SPAIR sequences were further analyzed. The gross primary tumor volume, metastatic lymph nodes, parotid glands, and pterygoid muscles were delineated using five segmentors. A robust image quality analysis platform was developed to objectively score the SPAIR sequences on the basis of qualitative and quantitative metrics. Sequences were analyzed for the signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio and compared with fat and muscle, conspicuity, pairwise distance metrics, and segmentor assessments. In this analysis, the nonsuppressed sequence was inferior to each of the SPAIR sequences for the primary tumor, lymph nodes, and parotid glands, but it was superior for the pterygoid muscles. The SPAIR sequence that received the highest combined score among the analysis categories was recommended to Unity MR-Linac users for HNC radiotherapy treatment planning. Our study led to two developments: an optimized, 3D, T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence that can be disseminated to Unity MR-Linac users and a robust image quality analysis pathway that can be used to objectively score SPAIR sequences and can be customized and generalized to any image quality optimization protocol. Improved segmentation accuracy with the proposed SPAIR sequence will potentially lead to improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity for patients by maximizing the target coverage and minimizing the radiation exposure of organs at risk.",

This study aimed to investigate food sociality in three provinces of South China to provide theoretical and practical evidence of food sociality in the region and to revise nutrition policies. We conducted a qualitative study comprising 25 experts in the fields of nutrition, sociology, food science, and agriculture from Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi Province by using a semi-structured in-depth interview, which included 28 pre-determined questions covering six topics. The interviews were conducted between November 2020 and March 2021. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed thematically using NVivo 11.0. Of the 25 experts, the mean age was 50.6 (SD = 8.4) years, 15 (60%) were male, and 22 (88%) held a master's degree or above. The analysis showed that food sociality in three provinces of South China mainly comprises social functions of food and dietary behavior. Regarding social functions of food, the experts expressed that food represents local culture (72%, 18 experts), presents social status and economic power (40%, 10 experts), and is central to special occasions, traditional customs, and etiquette activities (60%, 15 experts). In terms of social functions of dietary behaviors, the majority of experts indicated that food is a social communication tool (72% experts), has geographical characteristics (80% experts), and, to some extent, is used as a proxy for reward or punishment. Furthermore, festivals are one of the core elements of food sociality in the region, although food safety is a major concern. Some dietary behaviors, such as overindulgence in afternoon tea and encouraging drinking, may increase the risk of chronic diseases. Food sociality in three provinces of South China is mainly related to the social function of food and dietary behavior. It is a combination of local culture, social status and economic power, traditional customs, rewards and punishments, geographical food preference, and social communication tools.

The translocation results in forming the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL) tyrosine kinase. CML results in an increase in the number of white blood cells and alteration in tyrosine kinase expression. CML prognosis includes three stages, namely chronic, accelerated, and blast. The diagnosis method involves a CT scan, biopsy, and complete blood count. However, due to certain disadvantages, early diagnosis of CML is not possible by traditional methods. Nanotechnology offers many advantages in diagnosing and treating cancer. We searched PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar using the keywords Philadelphia chromosome, bionanotechnology, tyrosine kinase pathway, half-life, passive targeting, and organic and inorganic nanoparticles. The relevant papers and the classical papers in this field were selected to write about in this review. The sensitivity and specificity of an assay can be improved by nanoparticles. Utilizing this property, peptides, antibodies, aptamers, etc., in the form of nanoparticles, can be used to detect cancer at a much earlier stage. The half-life of the drug is also increased by nanoformulation. The nanoparticle-coated drugs can easily escape from the immune system.

Recently, scavenging of ROS reduced the cytotoxicity of DOX, suggesting a new approach for using DOX as an anticancer treatment. Thus, in this study, non-silica and silica redox nanoparticles (denoted as RNPN and siRNP, respectively) with ROS scavenging features have been designed to encapsulate DOX and reduce its cytotoxicity. DOX-loaded RNPN (DOX@RNPN) and DOX-loaded siRNP (DOX@siRNP) were prepared by co-dissolving DOX with RNPN and siRNP, respectively. The size and stability of nanoparticles were characterized by the dynamic light scattering system. Additionally, encapsulation efficiency, loading capacity, and release profile of DOX@RNPN and DOX@siRNP were identified by measuring the absorbance of DOX. Finally, the cytotoxicity of DOX@RNPN and DOX@siRNP against normal murine fibroblast cells (L929), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were also investigated. The obtained result showed that RNPN exhibited a pH-sensitive character while silanol moieties improved the stability of siRNP in physiological conditions. DOX@RNPN and DOX@siRNP were formed at several tens of nanometers in diameter with narrow distribution. Moreover, DOX@siRNP stabilized under different pH buffers, especially gastric pH, and improved encapsulation of DOX owing to the addition of silanol groups. DOX@RNPN and DOX@siRNP maintained anticancer activity of DOX against HepG2, and MCF-7 cells, while their cytotoxicity on L929 cells was significantly reduced compared to free DOX treatment.

We report a case of a 50-year-old woman with no prior medical history initially, who presented with postprandial epigastric and right upper quadrant pain that continued to worsen and was associated with early satiety, nausea, and weight loss of 25 pounds over 2 months, which prompted further evaluation by her primary care physician. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination a month later revealed a large heterogeneous area measuring 8.5 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 7.4 cm in the inferior right hepatic lobe with heterogeneous enhancement and involvement of the gallbladder, concerning for cholangiocarcinoma. Given radiographic findings, she underwent a computed tomography (CT)-guided core biopsy of the liver, which showed a necrotic malignant tumor favoring adenocarcinoma and was also found to have germline BRCA mutation. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed a large partially necrotic fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid mass, possibly arising from the gallbladder fossa with an invasion of both lobes of the liver and probable involvement of a portion of the ascending colon. There was no gross evidence of distant metastatic disease. The patient underwent staging laparoscopy prior to initiating chemotherapy, and another biopsy was done, which returned in favor of SCC, with immunohistochemical stains being positive for cytokeratin (CK)19, Ber-EP4 (epithelial antigen recognized by Ber-EP4 antibody), and P40 (DeltaNp63); while negative for CK7, CK20, caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX-2), paired box 8 (PAX-8), and mucicarmine.

The success of allo-HSCT depends on the engraftment of donor cells and the elimination of recipient cells monitored through chimerism testing. We aimed to validate a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based chimerism assay for engraftment monitoring and to emphasize the importance of including the most prevalent cell subsets in proficiency testing (PT) programs. We evaluated the analytical performance of NGS-based chimerism testing (AlloSeq-HCT and CareDx) with a panel of targeted 202 informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (i.e., linearity and precision, analytical sensitivity and specificity, system accuracy, and reproducibility). We further compared the performance of our NGS panel with conventional short tandem repeat (STR) analysis in unfractionated whole blood and cell-subset-enriched CD3 and CD66. Our NGS-based chimerism monitoring assay has an impressive detection limit (0.3% host DNA) for minor alleles and analytical specificity (99.9%). Pearson's correlation between NGS- and STR-based chimerism monitoring showed a linear relationship with a slope of 0.8 and r = 0.973. The concordance of allo-HSCT patients using unfractionated whole blood, CD3, and CD66 was 0.95, 0.96, and 0.54, respectively. Utilization of CD3+ cell subsets for mixed chimerism detection yielded an average of 7.3 \u00b1 7-fold higher donor percentage detection compared to their corresponding unfractionated whole blood samples. The accuracy of the NGS assay achieved a concordance of 98.6% on blinded external quality control STR samples.

Our study provided robust validation of NGS-based chimerism testing for accurate detection and monitoring of engraftment in allo-HSCT patients. By incorporating the cell subsets (CD3 and CD66), the sensitivity and accuracy of engraftment monitoring are significantly improved, making them an essential component of any PT program.

        "AbstractText": "Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a common, chronic, complex, often under-reported and under-treated condition with a significant impact on quality of life. It poses a high burden on healthcare systems. Clam ileocystoplasty is an invasive procedure typically reserved for the treatment of severe refractory cases. Malignant transformation in the area of anastomosis remains a rare but real, life-threatening risk in the patient group and requires active life-long surveillance and follow-up. We report the case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with recurrent urinary tract infections and non-visible haematuria 30 years after clam ileocystoplasty for urge incontinence. Imaging revealed an anterior bladder tumour with hepatic metastases. On multiple occasions, she was unfit for any invasive surgical sampling options to obtain tissue samples to allow for treatment planning, and was provided with best supportive care. The disease rapidly progressed to death within 10 weeks of presentation. This case buttresses the need for informed consent regarding the risks, including malignant transformation several years after the procedure, and the necessity for lifelong follow-up and surveillance cystoscopy, with frequency tailored to individual patient risk assessment.",

        "AbstractText": "Low-dose computed tomography is being used for lung cancer screening in high-risk groups. Detecting lung cancer at an early stage improves the chance of optimal treatment and increases overall survival. This article compares segmentectomy vs. lobectomy as surgical options, in the case of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma, ideally IA. To compare the 2 previously referred strategies, data were collected from articles (40 studies were reviewed), reviews, and systematic analyses in PubMed Central, as well as reviewing recent literature. Segmentectomy could be an equal alternative to lobectomy in early-stage NSCLC (tumour < 2 cm). It could be preferred for patients with a low cardiopulmonary reserve, who struggle to survive a lobectomy. As far as early-stage NSCLC is concerned, anatomic segmentectomy is an acceptable procedure in a selective group of patients. For better tumour and stage classification, a systematic lymph node dissection should be performed.",

        "AbstractText": "Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is widespread in abdominal interventional imaging, but its long acquisition time makes it susceptible to patient motion. Image-based autofocus has shown success in CBCT deformable motion compensation, via deep autofocus metrics and multi-region optimization, but it is challenged by the large parameter dimensionality required to capture intricate motion trajectories. This work leverages the differentiable nature of deep autofocus metrics to build a novel optimization strategy, Multi-Stage Adaptive Spine Autofocus (MASA), for compensation of complex deformable motion in abdominal CBCT. MASA poses the autofocus problem as a multi-stage adaptive sampling strategy of the motion trajectory, sampled with Hermite spline basis with variable amplitude and knot temporal positioning. The adaptive method permits simultaneous optimization of the sampling phase, local temporal sampling density, and time-dependent amplitude of the motion trajectory. The optimization is performed in a multi-stage schedule with increasing number of knots that progressively accommodates complex trajectories in late stages, preconditioned by coarser components from early stages, and with minimal increase in dimensionality. MASA was evaluated in controlled simulation experiments with two types of motion trajectories: i) combinations of slow drifts with sudden jerk (sigmoid) motion; and ii) combinations of periodic motion sources of varying frequency into multi-frequency trajectories. Further validation was obtained in clinical data from liver CBCT featuring motion of contrast-enhanced vessels, and soft-tissue structures. The adaptive sampling strategy provided successful motion compensation in sigmoid trajectories, compared to fixed sampling strategies (mean SSIM increase of 0.026 compared to 0.011). Inspection of the estimated motion showed the capability of MASA to automatically allocate larger sampling density to parts of the scan timeline featuring sudden motion, effectively accommodating complex motion without increasing the problem dimension. Experiments on multi-frequency trajectories with 3-stage MASA (5, 10, and 15 knots) yielded a twofold SSIM increase compared to single-stage autofocus with 15 knots (0.076 vs 0.040, respectively). Application of MASA to clinical datasets resulted in simultaneous improvement on the delineation of both contrast-enhanced vessels and soft-tissue structures in the liver. A new autofocus framework, MASA, was developed including a novel multi-stage technique for adaptive temporal sampling of the motion trajectory in combination with fully differentiable deep autofocus metrics. This novel adaptive sampling approach is a crucial step for application of deformable motion compensation to complex temporal motion trajectories.",

We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) and robot-assisted adrenalectomy (RA) for large pheochromocytoma (\u2265 5cm) at our center between January 2015 to February 2023. We compared the perioperative outcomes between the two groups and investigated impact of high Nor-Metanephrine (NMN) levels on perioperative outcomes by analyzing this subgroup. A total of 115 patients were included in the study, with 48 patients in the robotic group and 67 patients in the laparoscopic group. The following significant difference were identified in favor of RA: shorter operative (excluding docking time) time (190.0 vs 220.0 min, p=0.002), lower estimated blood loss (50.0 vs 120.0 mL, p=0.013), however, RA group has higher surgical expenses (37933.0 vs 7936.0 CNY, p< 0.001). This finding remained consistent when analyzing patients with high NMN levels. Patients with large pheochromocytoma may experience reduced blood loss and shorter operative time when undergoing robot-assisted adrenalectomy. However, it is important to note that the RA approach is associated with significantly higher costs.",

Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate due to unspecific symptoms being responsible for late diagnosis. In this study, the authors analysed selected nutritional parameters and the severity of anaemia in patients diagnosed with pancreatic head cancer. Data were collected upon admission to the 2nd Clinical Department of General, Gastrointestinal, and Oncological Surgery in the University Clinical Hospital in Bialystok, Poland and retrospectively with the help of correctly collected anamnesis. It has been shown that most patients with pancreatic cancer are malnourished at the time of diagnosis. Body mass index (BMI) is the least valuable parameter primarily. Weight loss has been determined to be the most accurate predictor of the patient's metabolic status, although it should never be the only parameter. Although these factors do not suggest an inflammatory process, serum protein levels and albumin concentration should be considered. When assessing the nutritional status of patients with pancreatic cancer, many predictive factors should be considered. BMI seems to be the least accurate parameter for assessing nutritional status in patients diagnosed with cancer.

To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of ASF1B expression in human LIHC on the basis of TCGA data. A meta-analysis revealed that high ASF1B expression was strongly associated with better overall survival. A comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of 33 human cancers revealed the immunotherapeutic value of ASF1B. In this study, we observed a significant upregulation of ASF1B expression in LIHC samples compared to non-cancer samples. Clinical analysis showed that high expression of ASF1B was associated with age, tumour status, and clinical stage. Survival analysis showed that patients with high ASF1B expression had worse overall survival and progression-free survival than patients with low ASF1B expression. The AUCs of the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival-related ROC curves were 0.672, 0.590, and 0.591, respectively.

        "AbstractText": "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and dysplasia. The gene encoding ten-eleven translocation 2 (tet2), a dioxygenase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, is a recurrently mutated tumor suppressor gene in MDS and other myeloid malignancies. Previously, we reported a stable zebrafish line with a loss-of-function mutation in the tet2 gene. The tet2m/m-mutant zebrafish developed a pre-MDS state with kidney marrow dysplasia, but normal circulating blood counts by 11 months of age and accompanying anemia, signifying the onset of MDS, by 24 months of age. In the current study, we collected progenitor cells from the kidney marrows of the adult tet2m/m and tet2wt/wt fish at 4 and 15 months of age and conducted enhanced reduced representation of bisulfite sequencing (ERRBS) and bulk RNA-seq to measure changes in DNA methylation and gene expression of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). A global increase in DNA methylation of gene promoter regions and CpG islands was observed in tet2m/m HSPCs at 4 months of age when compared with the wild type. Furthermore, hypermethylated genes were significantly enriched for targets of SUZ12 and the metal-response-element-binding transcription factor 2 (MTF2)-involved in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). However, between 4 and 15 months of age, we observed a paradoxical global decrease in DNA methylation in tet2m/m HSPCs. Gene expression analyses identified upregulation of genes associated with mTORC1 signaling and interferon gamma and alpha responses in tet2m/m HSPCs at 4 months of age when compared with the wild type. Downregulated genes in HSPCs of tet2-mutant fish at 4 months of age were enriched for cell cycle regulation, heme metabolism, and interleukin 2 (IL2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling, possibly related to increased self-renewal and clonal advantage in HSPCs with tet2 loss of function. Finally, there was an overall inverse correlation between overall increased promoter methylation and gene expression.",

However, the best PSA cutoff value remains controversial. We compared the predictive performance of age-specific percentile-based PSA thresholds with a conventional cutoff of >4 ng/mL for the risk of PCa. We included men who received PSA measurements between 2003 and 2017 in a medical center in Taiwan. Logistic regression modeling was used to assess the association between age-specific percentile-based PSA thresholds and PCa risk in age subgroups. We further applied C-statistic and decision curve analysis to compare the predictive performance of age-specific percentile-based PSA with that of a conventional cutoff PSA. We identified 626 patients with PCa and 40 836 patients without PCa. The slope of PSA in patients >60-year-old was almost 3 times that of those <60-year-old (0.713 vs 0.259). The risk effect sizes of the 75th percentile PSA cutoff (<60-year-old: 2.19; 60-70-year-old: 4.36; >70-year-old: 5.84 ng/mL) were comparable to those observed based on the conventional cutoff in all age groups. However, the discrimination performance of the 75th percentile PSA cutoff was better than that of the conventional cutoff among patients aged <60-year-old (C-statistic, 0.783 vs. 0.729, p < 0.05). The 75th percentile cutoffs also correctly identified an additional 2 patients with PCa for every 100 patients with PSA screening at the threshold probability of 20%.

We retrospectively collected clinical and ultrasound data from 227 patients with TN and concomitant HT(161 for training, 66 for testing). Two experienced sonographers delineated the TG and TN regions, and USR features were extracted using Python. Lasso regression and logistic analysis were employed to select relevant USR features and clinical data to construct the model for differentiating benign and malignant TN. The performance of the model was evaluated using area under the curve(AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis(DCA). A total of 1,162 USR features were extracted from TN and the TG in the 227 patients with HT. Lasso regression identified 14 features, which were used to construct the TN score, TG score, and TN+TG score. Univariate analysis identified six clinical predictors: TI-RADS, echoic type, aspect ratio, boundary, calcification, and thyroid function. Multivariable analysis revealed that incorporating USR scores improved the performance of the model for differentiating benign and malignant TN in patients with HT. Specifically, the TN+TG score resulted in the highest increase in AUC(from 0.83 to 0.94) in the clinical prediction model. Calibration curves and DCA demonstrated higher accuracy and net benefit for the TN+TG+clinical model. USR features of both the TG and TN can be utilized for differentiating benign and malignant TN in patients with HT. These findings highlight the importance of considering the entire TG in the evaluation of TN in HT patients, providing valuable insights for clinical decision-making in this population.",

A better understanding of the disease\u00a0and\u00a0factors influencing its course and potential therapeutic targets is imperative for improving its overall outcome. Through comprehensive cytogenetic analysis, it has been established that the development of periampullary carcinogenesis involves specific chromosomal aberrations, dysregulation of oncogenes, and suppression of genes in a multistep progressive manner. Our study aimed to evaluate the expression of human epidermal growth factor (HER2Neu) in periampullary cancers using immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization. Material and methods This was a retrospective study in which all consecutive cases of periampullary carcinoma diagnosed over a period of three years were evaluated.

Over a third of adults in the United States are obese. Pharmacological agents have been designed to reduce weight gain caused by excessive calorie intake and low physical activity. They work by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fat or stimulating the secretion of satiety hormones. These drugs include lipase inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide\u00a01 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. However, the current weight-loss strategies do not effectively treat genetic-related diseases, such as generalized lipodystrophy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency.

Methods KB cells were cultured using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium\u00a0and Inhibitory Concentration- 50 (IC50) was determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide\u00a0assay.\u00a0BCl-2, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), nuclear factor kappa- B (\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bNF-kB), and interleukin (IL)-6 were assessed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)(at 50 and 100 \u00b5g/ ml < IC50).\u00a0Schr\u00f6dinger\u00a0was used for docking analysis using nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-kB) (Protein Data Bank: 5T8O) and dopamine (CID 681). Results Results were represented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and statistically evaluated. Dopamine showed severe growth inhibition in KB cells (IC50- 225\u00b13.1\u00b5g/ ml).\u00a0It downregulated the expression of BCl-2, NF-k, and IL-6, but increased TNF-\u03b1 expression. Dopamine bonded with NF-kB by two hydrogen bonds with aspartic acid\u200b\u200b-53and alanine-54,\u00a0respectively). Conclusion The present study revealed that dopamine has a significant anti-cancer potential by blocking NF-kB\u00a0pathways in KB cells.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A Systematic Review of Chemotherapeutic Regimens Used in Pancreatic Cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic cancer is a malignant tumor with one of the worst prognosis. Its incidence has been on the rise in recent years. First-line and second-line treatments as well as adjuvant therapies have been employed in clinical trials for pancreatic cancer along with traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy that has been enhanced. The prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still quite bad despite recent improvements in diagnostic and treatment methods. Since most patients are not candidates for treatment with a curative purpose, effective palliative care is crucial. For this systematic review, between December 25, 2022, and January 5, 2023, we searched PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, and Science Direct and discovered 225 relevant articles. The appropriateness of the literature abstracts for the pooled analysis was evaluated using different combinations of keywords such as pancreatic cancer, first- and second-line chemotherapy, palliative chemotherapy, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GnP), FOLFIRINOX (FFX), and fluorouracil. Eight research studies with a total of 15,236 people, including systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), were included. The only treatment of choice for patients without metastatic disease who have clinical staging that suggests resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) should be resection. This research examined how first- and second-line chemotherapeutic regimens (using different drug combinations) affected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) or BRPC and how they responded in terms of overall survival (OS), tumor resectability, and progression-free interval. The review concludes by highlighting the results of these therapies. Notably, a growing body of research indicates that the two most popular first-line medication combinations GnP and FFX have similar results in RCTs and in real-world populations. Results of second-line therapy after first-line regime failure are still dismal, and there is still a great deal of doubt regarding the best course of action. More RCTs and real-world evidence studies that address current and innovative regimens, as well as the best order in which to administer them, are required, with a greater emphasis on targeted therapy with fewer side effects.",

        "AbstractText": "Smooth muscle is a normal component of the inferior vena cava (IVC) wall. Although uncommon, the smooth muscle component may undergo neoplastic change. Benign neoplasms are termed leiomyomas, and when there is a malignant change, the nomenclature is changed to an IVC leiomyosarcoma. Leiomyosarcomas of the IVC are rare, with less than 150 cases reported in medical literature. Unfortunately, the majority of IVC leiomyosarcomas are diagnosed at advanced disease stages. Surgical resection of locally advanced lesions is technically challenging, but complete resection is the mainstay of treatment as leiomyosarcomas respond poorly to chemo-radiotherapy. Due to the advanced disease stage at diagnosis and the technical complexity of IVC resection and reconstruction, most patients are transferred to high-volume centers in developed nations. We report a case of a patient with a locally advanced leiomyosarcoma masquerading as a pancreatic head tumor. This patient could not access care in a high-volume center and required aggressive maneuvers to resect the IVC leiomyosarcoma in a resource-poor, low-volume center. We present this case to highlight the steps in operative management and also to show that these procedures can be carried out in resource-poor environments once there is meticulous planning, appropriate equipment, and multidisciplinary care.",

        "AbstractText": "Background In line with the growing industrial applications of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) in various fields, concerns about their potentially harmful consequences on the environment, human, and animal health are increasing. Giloy is considered an alternative medicine to treat various ailments. Giloy's potential in helping manage diabetes, alleviating arthritis and joint pain, and addressing skin disorders such as eczema and acne\u00a0underscores its multifaceted role in traditional medicine. Moreover, it is deemed beneficial for reducing stress and anxiety levels, promoting liver health, and potentially impacting heart health by regulating cholesterol levels. Emerging research also explores its potential in cancer prevention. This study aimed to evaluate the hematotoxicity of CuONPs and the alleviating effect of giloy in adult rats. Materials and methods In this experiment, 28 laboratory rats were used, set to four groups (7/group), as follows: control group without any dose; CuONPs group administered copper oxide nanoparticles at 300 mg/kg/day; CuONPs + giloy group dosed with CuONPs at 300 mg/kg/day plus giloy at 100 mg/kg/day; giloy group treated only with giloy at 100 mg/kg/day. All treatments were given by gastric gavage and continued for 28 uninterrupted days. Results Dosing animals with CuONPs led to significant adverse changes in the examined blood profile. In contrast, when the animals were coadministered with giloy, restoring the disturbed blood levels was observed. Conclusion Copper oxide nanoparticles at a high dose had notable hematotoxicity in laboratory rats\u00a0and, supplemented with giloy, could reduce this hematological toxicity.",

        "AbstractText": "Estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) was discovered more than 20\u00a0years ago. However, the extent and role of ER\u03b2 expression in breast cancer remain controversial, especially in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). ER\u03b2 exists as multiple isoforms, and a series of studies has revealed an inconsistent role of ER\u03b2 isoforms in TNBC. Our recent results demonstrated contrasting functions of ER\u03b21 and ER\u03b22/\u03b25 in TNBC. Additional research should be conducted to explore the functions of individual ER\u03b2 isoforms and develop targeted drugs according to the relevant mechanisms. Consequently, a systematic review of ER\u03b2 isoforms is necessary. In this review, we overview the structure of ER\u03b2 isoforms and detail what is known about the function of ER\u03b2 isoforms in normal mammary tissue and breast cancer. Moreover, this review highlights the divergent features of ER\u03b2 isoforms in TNBC. This review also provides insights into the implications of targeting ER\u03b2 isoforms for clinical treatment. In conclusion, this review provides a framework delineating the roles and mechanisms of different ER\u03b2 isoforms in TNBC and sheds light on future directions for basic and clinical research.",

        "AbstractText": "Cyclic thrombocytopenia (CTP) as the name suggests presents with cyclic episodes of thrombocytopenia and is frequently initially misdiagnosed as immune thrombocytopenia. Following a lack of sustained response or abnormally increased response to common treatments used for immune thrombocytopenia, a proper diagnosis of CTP can then be made. Prior reports have shown a subset of patients who respond to cyclosporin A. Here, we present a case of CTP that was initially at another facility presumed to have and treated for immune thrombocytopenic purpura. However, after multiple attempts to treat with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab, and eltrombopag, episodes of severe thrombocytopenia followed by thrombocytosis continued. The patient ultimately developed intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the setting of one of the episodes of severe thrombocytopenia and developed multiple subsequent complications from which the patient unfortunately did not recover. It was only after developing ICH that the patient had been evaluated at a center with hematology consultation capabilities, at which time after a detailed review of his case and pattern recognition the proper diagnosis of CTP was made with initiation of cyclosporine. This case was further complicated by need to maintain an adequate platelet threshold post-ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement which was necessary due to his ICH and was placed before diagnosis of CTP could be made. While CTP is a rare diagnosis, this case reinforces a greater need to properly diagnose and consider cyclosporine treatment for CTP, as it has been effective in some patients and may help to prevent patient morbidity and especially catastrophic bleeding complications.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of melphalan dosing and chronic kidney disease (CKD) on transplant-related outcomes, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). A retrospective chart review was performed, and MM patients who underwent ASCT between February 2016 and September 2021 were included. Melphalan 200 mg/m2 (Mel200) or 140 mg/m2 (Mel140) was administered. The cohort was divided based on renal function: creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u2265 60 mL/min (no-CKD) and CrCl < 60 mL/min (CKD). Outcomes measured include PFS, OS, treatment-related mortality (TRM), incidence of adverse events, hospitalization duration, and hospital readmission within 30 days. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, t-test, and Kaplan-Meier method. Logistic regression model was used to account for melphalan dose adjustment. A total of 124 patients were included (n = 108 no-CKD, and n = 16 CKD). Median age was 62 years, majority (62%) were male, and 97% had at least a partial response at time of ASCT. Of the 124 patients, nine (7%) received Mel140. Five of these patients had CKD (CrCl range: 26 - 58 mL/min), with one on hemodialysis. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 13.6 vs. 14.9 days and median time to platelet engraftment was 18.3 vs. 18.5 days in the CKD group vs. no-CKD group, respectively (P = 0.03 and P = 0.8). When adjusting for melphalan dose reduction, the median time to neutrophil engraftment was not statistically significant (P = 0.11).

However, the relative efficacy of various drug combinations has been contentious. We aimed to identify the most effective chemotherapy regimens for newly diagnosed ENKTCL. A network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the differences in survival and treatment responses across various regimens. The primary objective was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and complete response (CR). We utilized a Bayesian framework to perform the network meta-analysis. Rank probabilities were assessed by the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Node-splitting method was used to assess the inconsistency. A total of 1,113 patients were enrolled across 10 studies. Chemotherapy regimens were grouped into five modalities, for which six types of direct comparisons were available. We identified the asparaginase (ASP)/gemcitabine (GEM)-based regimens superiority over ANT-based, non-ASP/ANT-based and ASP/methotrexate (MTX)-based regimens on OS. Although no significant differences were observed compared with ASP/not otherwise specified-based, ASP/GEM-based regimens were still the best option chemotherapy for OS. Moreover, the ASP/GEM-based regimens demonstrated advantages in PFS, ORR and CR. According to our network meta-analysis, it appears that ASP/GEM-based regimens could potentially serve as the most effective frontline chemotherapy option for ENKTCL.",

Due to the inherent physical properties of high-energy radiation, enhancing the therapeutic gain ratio of radiotherapy through radiophysical techniques inevitably encounters challenges. The combination of hyperthermia and radiotherapy can enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, reduce their radioresistance, and holds significant clinical utility in radiotherapy. Multifunctional nanomaterials with excellent biocompatibility and safety have garnered widespread attention in tumor hyperthermia research, demonstrating promising potential. Utilizing nanotechnology as a sensitizing carrier in conjunction with radiotherapy, and high atomic number nanomaterials can also serve independently as radiosensitizing carriers. This synergy between tumor hyperthermia and radiotherapy may overcome many challenges currently limiting tumor radiotherapy, offering new opportunities for its further advancement. In recent years, the continuous progress in the synthesis and design of novel nanomaterials will propel the future development of medical imaging and cancer treatment. This article summarizes the radiosensitizing mechanisms and effects based on gold nanotechnology and provides an overview of the advancements of other nanoparticles (such as bismuth-based nanomaterials, magnetic nanomaterials, selenium nanomaterials, etc.) in the process of radiation therapy.",

An ecological study analyzed secondary data of women diagnosed with breast cancer who died between 2000 and 2019. Sociodemographic factors, screening procedures, and PHC were examined in relation to breast cancer mortality. Statistical analyses included normality tests, Kruskal-Wallis and one-way ANOVA tests with post hoc comparisons, Pearson and Spearman correlation tests, age-period-cohort analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analysis. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Mortality rates were higher in the southeast (15.77) and south (15.97) regions compared to the north (5.07) (p < 0.0001). Survival rates were longer in the southeast (70.3 \u00b1 0.05) and south (70.6 \u00b1 0.09) than in the north (63.98 \u00b1 0.053) (p \u2264 0.001). Mortality increased with age after 32 years (p \u2264 0.001). Brown and indigenous women had lower mortality and survival rates.

We reviewed electronic reports of patients referred for colonoscopy procedures over 20\u2009years. We compared demographic, clinical, and endoscopic findings between major ethnic population groups in Israel. In addition, trends of screening utilization, bowel preparation, and polyp detection rates were tracked, and the incidence of CRC diagnosis was followed. A total of 51307 patients had undergone colonoscopies, of whom 16% were Arabs, and 84% were Jewish. The procedures performed for CRC screening throughout the study period were significantly lower in Arabs (5% vs. 13.1%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). In parallel, for most of the follow-up period, the Arab patients had higher rates of inadequate bowel preparation (overall: 19.9% vs. 12%; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and a lower polyp detection rate (16.7% vs. 22.5%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Expectedly, the incidence of CRC has steadily decreased in the Jewish group, while an adverse pattern of increasing incidence was documented in the Arab patient during the follow-up period.

In this single-center retrospective study medical records of 191 patients with NPC undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the Department of Radiotherapy, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from January 2021 to December 2021 were reviewed. A total of 120 patients met eligibility criteria and were included. The taste alterations and QoL at multiple time points during radiotherapy (RT) were compared. There were significant differences in the intensity of taste, discomfort, phantogeusia and parageusia or overall taste alterations at multiple time points during CRT (p-Value<0.001). These four parameters were significantly higher two or four weeks after CRT, or at the end of CRT compared to before CRT (p-Value <0.001). The intensity of taste, discomfort, phantogeusia and parageusia or overall taste alterations were all significantly higher four weeks after CRT compared to two weeks after CRT (p-Value <0.001), and at the end of CRT compared to four weeks after CRT (p-Value <0.001). The chemotherapy-induced taste alteration scale (CiTAS) scores were highest at the end of CRT (p-Value <0.001). There were significant differences in QoL at multiple time points during CRT (p-Value <0.001), and each parameter differed significantly at various time points (p <0.05). The QoL of all areas at the end of CRT were significantly higher than those before CRT, or two or four weeks after CRT (p-Value <0.001). In patients with NPC undergoing CRT, taste alterations increasingly worsen as treatment progresses, with poor QoL outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "Contrast enhanced mammography (CEM), a relatively new and promising modality, combines mammography (MMG) with an iodinated contrast material to illuminate neovascularity within the breast; analogous to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CEM improves the overall sensitivity of MMG; reduces the need for unnecessary biopsies and follow-up imaging and can be considered a reasonable substitute for MRI. In Pakistan, CEM was recently introduced and to assess its usability a study was conducted on five patients before making it available as a regular investigation. Four out of the five patients had a clinical suspicion of malignancy with two patients having heterogeneously dense breasts and two with dense breasts. All enhancing lesions were concordant on biopsy and had similar corresponding findings on additional imaging such as ultrasound (US) and/or MRI. CEM in all four cases of biopsy proven malignancy facilitated surgical planning. The fifth patient underwent CEM for screening and was found to have no enhancing lesion. In low-middle-income countries (LMICs) where breast MRI is not readily available and expensive for the populace, CEM can be a reliable alternative. The initial experience with CEM at our hospital shows better visualization of malignant lesions in dense and heterogeneously dense breasts with an easy-to-perform technique and a shorter imaging time while facilitating surgical decision-making in terms of breast conservation.",

        "AbstractText": "Introduction: Breast cancer is a significant cause of mortality in women globally, and current treatment approaches face challenges due to side effects and drug resistance. Nanotechnology offers promising solutions by enabling targeted drug delivery and minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. Methods: In this study, we developed a composite platform called (Alg-AgNPs-CisPt), consisting of silver nanoparticles coated with an alginate hydrogel embedding cisplatin. We examined the effectiveness of this nanocomplex in induce synergistic cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells. Results and Discussion: Characterization using various analytical techniques confirmed the composition of the nanocomplex and the distribution of its components. Cytotoxicity assays and apoptosis analysis demonstrated that the nanocomplex exhibited greater efficacy against breast cancer cells compared to AgNPs or cisplatin as standalone treatments. Moreover, the nanocomplex was found to enhance intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, further validating its efficacy. The synergistic action of the nanocomplex constituents offers potential advantages in reducing side effects associated with higher doses of cisplatin as a standalone treatment. Overall, this study highlights the potential of the (Alg-AgNPs-CisPt) nanocomplex as a promising platform embedding components with synergistic action against breast cancer cells.",

Common-sense model has shown the impact of patients' perception of illness on health behaviors. However, for patients with lung cancer after thoracoscopic surgery, there has been no relevant exploration of disease perception. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical status of patients with lung cancer patients who have undergone thoracoscopic surgery, and to explore the correlation between frailty, disease perception, and lung functional exercise compliance. The cross-sectional study included 218 patients with lung cancer after thoracoscopic surgery. We collected participants' frailty, disease perception, exercise adherence, and relevant clinical information. T-test, Chi-square, Linear regression, Pearson's correlation, and mediation analysis were used for statistical analysis of patient data. We analyzed the data by disease perception with high and low median scores and found significant differences in lymphatic dissection, stool within three days, pain, thoracic drainage tube placement time. Linear regression results show that, after controlling for confounding factors, frailty and disease perception were significantly associated with pulmonary function exercise compliance. The higher the frailty score, the worse the compliance, and the higher the disease perception negative score, the less exercise. Illness perception played a partially mediating role in the association between frailty and lung functional exercise adherence. Frailty and disease perception have an impact on exercise adherence, therefore,\u00a0we need to consider these factors in the intervention to improve exercise compliance after thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer.",

However, its precise role in determining the prognosis of human cancer and immunological responses remains elusive. This study investigated the relationship between PTPN1 expression and clinical outcomes, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity in human cancers, which will improve understanding regarding its prognostic value and immunological role in pan-cancer. The PTPN1 expression profile was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia databases. Kaplan-Meier, univariate Cox regression, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were utilized to clarify the relationship between PTPN1 expression and the prognosis of pan-cancer patients. The relationships between PTPN1 expression and the presence of tumor-infiltrated immune cells were analyzed using Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumor tissues using Expression data and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to examine the effects of PTPN1 level on the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were used to investigate the relationship between PTPN1 expression, immune cell infiltration, and immune checkpoint gene expression in human breast cancer tissues and a mouse xenograft model. The pan-cancer analysis revealed that PTPN1 was frequently up-regulated in various cancers. High PTPN1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in most cancers. Furthermore, PTPN1 expression correlated highly with the presence of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the expression of immune checkpoint pathway marker genes in different cancers. Furthermore, PTPN1 significantly predicted the prognosis for patients undergoing immunotherapy. The results of the CCK-8 viability assay revealed that PTPN1 knockdown increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells to paclitaxel. Finally, our results demonstrated that PTPN1 was associated with immune infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression in breast cancer. PTPN1 was overexpressed in multiple cancer types and correlated with the clinical outcome and tumor immunity, suggesting it could be a valuable potential prognostic and immunological biomarker for pan-cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "4-Nitroquinoline N-oxide (4-NQO) and its derivatives react with genomic DNA to form stable quinolone monoadducts, which are highly mutagenic and genotoxic. While the chronic high-dose exposure of epithelial cells to a carcinogen such as 4-NQO leads to tumor development, its effect on other cells has not been explored yet. Since the immunosuppression due to aberrant immunological profile is recognized as a significant cause in tumors, here we determine the interaction between 4-NQO and immune cells both in vivo and in vitro, and its effect on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) progression in a murine model. Immune cell profiling of the spleen and peripheral blood revealed a significant decrease in the B-cell population in 4-NQO-exposed mice than the untreated group. Additionally, \u03b3\u03b4 T and CD5+ B lymphocyte populations decreased at both pre- and post-cancerous stages of OSCC. These results suggested that 4-NQO induced tumor transition from pre-malignant lesions to OSCC by altering certain immune cells systemically. Next, to establish the effect of 4-NQO on immune cells, human B- and T-cell lines were subjected to 4-NQO; the reduction in cell viability, increase in DNA damage response marker, and induction of apoptosis were more pronounced in B than T cells. Altogether, our results indicated that in addition to the genotoxicity of oral epithelial cells, 4-NQO potentiates long-range effects on specific immune cells to induce cell death to cause very-early immunosuppressive response during oral carcinogenesis, and thus immunosuppression and tumor development are coevolved.",

        "AbstractText": "Non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), primarily due to the rupture of intracranial aneurysms, contributes significantly to the global stroke population. A novel biomarker, pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) or called the aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI), linked to progression-free survival and overall survival in non-small-cell lung cancer and mortality in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, has surfaced recently. Its role in non-traumatic SAH patients, however, remains under-researched. This study aims to determine the relationship between PIV and all-cause mortality in non-traumatic SAH patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database to examine the association between PIV and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with non-traumatic SAH. PIV measurements were collected at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, and several mortality measures were examined. To control for potential confounding effects, a 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) method was applied. The optimal PIV cutoff value was identified as 1362.45 using X-tile software that is often used to calculate the optimal cut-off values in survival analysis and continuous data of medical or epidemiological research. The relationship between PIV and short- and long-term all-cause mortality was analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve analysis. Interaction and subgroup analyses were also carried out. The study included 774 non-traumatic SAH patients. After PSM, 241 pairs of score-matched patients were generated. The Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for potential confounders, found a high PIV (\u2265 1362.45) independently associated with 90-day all-cause mortality both pre- (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.67; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.05-2.65; P = 0.030) and post-PSM (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.14-2.67; P = 0.042). K-M survival curves revealed lower 90-day survival rates in patients with PIV \u2265 1362.45 before (31.1% vs. 16.1%%, P < 0.001) and after PSM (68.9% vs. 80.9%, P < 0.001). Similarly, elevated PIV were associated with increased risk of ICU (pre-PSM: HR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.12-3.95; P = 0.02; post-PSM: HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.11-4.91; P = 0.016), in-hospital (pre-PSM: HR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.12-3.26; P = 0.018; post-PSM: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.10-3.84; P = 0.034), 30-day (pre-PSM: HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.01-2.82; P = 0.045; post-PSM: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.11-2.97; P = 0.047), and 1-year (pre-PSM: HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.04-2.40; P = 0.032; post-PSM: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.10-2.53; P = 0.044) all-cause mortality. The K-M survival curves confirmed lower survival rates in patients with higher PIV both pre- and post PSM for ICU (pre-PSM: 18.3% vs. 8.4%, P < 0.001; post-PSM:81.7 vs. 91.3%, P < 0.001), in-hospital (pre-PSM: 25.3% vs. 12.8%, P < 0.001; post-PSM: 75.1 vs. 88.0%, P < 0.001), 30-day (pre-PSM: 24.9% vs. 11.4%, P < 0.001; post-PSM:74.7 vs. 86.3%, P < 0.001), and 1-year (pre-PSM: 36.9% vs. 20.8%, P < 0.001; P = 0.02; post-PSM: 63.1 vs. 75.1%, P < 0.001) all-cause mortality. Stratified analyses indicated that the relationship between PIV and all-cause mortality varied across different subgroups. In critically ill patients suffering from non-traumatic SAH, an elevated PIV upon admission correlated with a rise in all-cause mortality at various stages, including ICU, in-hospital, the 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality, solidifying its position as an independent mortality risk determinant. This study represents an attempt to bridge the current knowledge gap and to provide a more nuanced understanding of the role of inflammation-based biomarkers in non-traumatic SAH. Nevertheless, to endorse the predictive value of PIV for prognosticating outcomes in non-traumatic SAH patients, additional prospective case-control studies are deemed necessary.",

        "AbstractText": "A healthy immune system is pivotal for the hosts to resist external pathogens and\u00a0maintain homeostasis; however, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) damages the anti-tumor immunity and promotes tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. Recently, many studies have found that Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are the major immunosuppressive cells that facilitate the formation of TME by promoting the development of various tumor-associated cells and suppressing the activity of effector immune cells. Considering the role of Tregs in tumor progression, it is pivotal to identify new therapeutic drugs to target and deplete Tregs in tumors. Although several studies have developed strategies for targeted deletion of Treg to reduce the TME and support the accumulation of effector T cells in tumors, Treg-targeted therapy systematically affects the Treg population and may lead to the progression of autoimmune diseases. It has been understood that, nevertheless, in disease conditions, Foxp3 undergoes several definite post-translational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and methylation. These PTMs not only elevate or mitigate the transcriptional activity of Foxp3 but also affect the stability and immunosuppressive function of Tregs. Various studies have shown that pharmacological targeting of enzymes involved in PTMs can significantly influence the PTMs of Foxp3; thus, it may influence the progression of cancers and/or autoimmune diseases. Overall, this review will help researchers to understand the advances in the immune-suppressive mechanisms of Tregs, the post-translational regulations of Foxp3, and the potential therapeutic targets and strategies to target the Tregs in TME to improve anti-tumor immunity.",

        "AbstractText": "The growth and metastasis of solid tumours is known to be facilitated by the tumour microenvironment (TME), which is composed of a highly diverse collection of cell types that interact and communicate with one another extensively. Many of these interactions involve the immune cell population within the TME, referred to as the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME). These non-cell autonomous interactions exert substantial influence over cell behaviour and contribute to the reprogramming of immune and stromal cells into numerous pro-tumourigenic phenotypes. The study of some of these interactions, such as the PD-1/PD-L1 axis that induces CD8+ T cell exhaustion, has led to the development of breakthrough therapeutic advances. Yet many common analyses of the TME either do not retain the spatial data necessary to assess cell-cell interactions, or interrogate few (<10) markers, limiting the capacity for cell phenotyping. Recently developed digital pathology technologies, together with sophisticated bioimage analysis programs, now enable the high-resolution, highly-multiplexed analysis of diverse immune and stromal cell markers within the TME of clinical specimens. In this article, we review the tumour-promoting non-cell autonomous interactions in the TME and their impact on tumour behaviour. We additionally survey commonly used image analysis programs and highly-multiplexed spatial imaging technologies, and we discuss their relative advantages and limitations. The spatial organization of the TME varies enormously between patients, and so leveraging these technologies in future studies to further characterize how non-cell autonomous interactions impact tumour behaviour may inform the personalization of cancer treatment.\u200b.",

With the widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in recent years, few studies have reported that immunotherapy is effective against PSC. As a multi-target anti-vascular targeting agent, anlotinib showed a better anti-tumor effect in various cancer species. The paper reported the therapeutic and side effects of pembrolizumab combined with anlotinib in a patient with advanced PSC. This is a 73 year old female patient who underwent thoracoscopy right upper lobectomy and was diagnosed as locally advanced PSC. However, the patient experienced tumor recurrence and metastasis 7 weeks after surgery and was unable to tolerate chemoradiotherapy. Moreover, she detected TP53 mutation and found that tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1 were high expression. Therefore, the patient received pembrolizumab combined with anlotinib treatment. After 15 cycles of treatment, the tumor significantly shrank with no tumor activity. The evaluation of tumor efficacy is partial response (PR). During the treatment period, she experienced one-degree thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation and two-degree hand-foot syndrome. Pembrolizumab and anlotinib was continued for two years as a maintenance treatment. The patient had a good quality of life and no disease progression was observed. Currently, the patient is still alive without tumor progression and has overall survival exceeding 45 months and toxic side effects were tolerable. Combining ICIs and anti-angiogenic targeted therapy has brought new hope in treating advanced PSC. Additionally, TMB and PD-L1 expression could be potential predictive biomarkers of the efficacy in advanced PSC with immunotherapy.",

Thus, unravelling the key modulator in metastasis is important for the development of clinical therapies. Gut microbiota dysregulation is a key event during CRC progression and metastasis. Numerous studies have elucidated the correlation between specific gut bacteria strains (e.g., pks + E. coli and Bacteroides fragilis) and CRC initiation, and gut bacteria translocation is commonly witnessed during CRC progression. Gut microbiota shapes tumor microenvironment (TME) through direct contact with immune cells or through its functional metabolites.

However, its comprehensive influence on pathological immune responses in the respiratory epithelium and peripheral immune cells is not yet fully understood. In this study, we analyzed multiple public scRNA-seq datasets of nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood to investigate the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate and severe disease, respectively. Cell-cell communication networks among cell types were also inferred. Finally, validations were conducted using bulk RNA-seq and proteome data. Similar and dissimilar regulons were identified within or between epithelial and immune cells during COVID-19 severity progression. The relative transcription factors (TFs) and their targets were used to construct GRNs among different infection sites and conditions. Between respiratory epithelial and peripheral immune cells, different TFs tended to be used to regulate the activity of a cell between healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients, although they had some TFs in common. For example, XBP1, FOS, STAT1, and STAT2 were activated in both the epithelial and immune cells of virus-infected individuals. In contrast, severe COVID-19 cases exhibited activation of CEBPD in peripheral immune cells, while CEBPB was exclusively activated in respiratory epithelial cells. Moreover, in patients with severe COVID-19, although some inflammatory genes, such as S100A8/A9, were found to be upregulated in both respiratory epithelial and peripheral immune cells, their relative regulators can differ in terms of cell types. The cell-cell communication analysis suggested that epidermal growth factor receptor signaling among epithelia contributes to mild/moderate disease, and chemokine signaling among immune cells contributes to severe disease. This study identified cell type- and condition-specific regulons in a wide range of cell types from the initial infection site to the peripheral blood, and clarified the diverse mechanisms of maladaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

        "AbstractText": "QL1604 is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death protein 1. This first-in-human, open-label phase I study aimed to investigate the safety and tolerability and to identify the recommended doses of QL1604 for future studies. Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and preliminary antitumor activity were also assessed. Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who failed or had no standard therapies available were recruited. In the dose-escalation phase, patients were treated with QL1604 at 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 weeks (Q2W) in an accelerated titration with a traditional 3\u00a0+\u00a03 design, followed by a dose-expansion phase at 3 mg/kg Q2W, 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (Q3W), 10 mg/kg Q2W and a fixed dose of 200 mg Q3W. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed during the first 28 days after the first dose of study drug. Adverse events (AEs) were graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, and antitumor activity of QL1604 was evaluated by investigators on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. A total of 35 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors were enrolled. DLTs were reported in one patient at the dose level of 3 mg/kg Q2W (grade 3 immune-mediated myositis and myasthenia gravis), and maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The most frequent treatment-related AEs (\u226510%) were fatigue (37.1%), anemia (22.9%), increased blood thyroid-stimulating hormone (17.1%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (17.1%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (14.3%), decreased white blood cell (WBC) count (11.4%), rash (14.3%), and pruritus (14.3%). AEs leading to discontinuation of QL1604 occurred in three of the 35 patients (8.6%). Partial responses (PRs) occurred in seven patients, resulting in an objective response rate of 20.0% (7/35). Single dose of QL1604 exhibited a dose-dependent increase in the exposure ranging from 0.3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. Mean receptor occupancy (RO) for QL1604 at the dose of 3 mg/kg (Q2W and Q3W) and 200 mg (Q3W) was greater than 80% during cycle 1 after one infusion. QL1604 monotherapy exhibited favorable safety, PK, and signal of antitumor activity in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, and the results supported further clinical studies of QL1604. On the basis of the safety, PK, and RO data, the recommended dosage for further clinical trials is 3 mg/kg or a fixed dose of 200 mg given every 3 weeks. https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05649761?term=QL1604&draw=2&rank=1, identifier NCT05649761.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The effects of Phycocyanobilin on experimental arthritis involve the reduction in nociception and synovial neutrophil infiltration, inhibition of cytokine production, and modulation of the neuronal proteome.",
        "AbstractText": "The antinociceptive and pharmacological activities of C-Phycocyanin (C-PC) and Phycocyanobilin (PCB) in the context of inflammatory arthritis remain unexplored so far. In the present study, we aimed to assess the protective actions of these compounds in an experimental mice model that replicates key aspects of human rheumatoid arthritis. Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was established by intradermal injection of methylated bovine serum albumin in C57BL/6 mice, and one hour before the antigen challenge, either C-PC (2, 4, or 8 mg/kg) or PCB (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally. Proteome profiling was also conducted on glutamate-exposed SH-SY5Y neuronal cells to evaluate the PCB impact on this key signaling pathway associated with nociceptive neuronal sensitization. C-PC and PCB notably ameliorated hypernociception, synovial neutrophil infiltration, myeloperoxidase activity, and the periarticular cytokine concentration of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A, and IL-4 dose-dependently in AIA mice. In addition, 1 mg/kg PCB downregulated the gene expression for T-bet, ROR\u03b3, and IFN-\u03b3 in the popliteal lymph nodes, accompanied by a significant reduction in the pathological arthritic index of AIA mice. Noteworthy, neuronal proteome analysis revealed that PCB modulated biological processes such as pain, inflammation, and glutamatergic transmission, all of which are involved in arthritic pathology. These findings demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of PCB in alleviating the nociception and inflammation in the AIA mice model and shed new light on mechanisms underlying the PCB modulation of the neuronal proteome. This research work opens a new avenue to explore the translational potential of PCB in developing a therapeutic strategy for inflammation and pain in rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "AbstractText": "Brain metastases (BrM), which commonly arise in patients with melanoma, breast cancer and lung cancer, are associated with a poor clinical prognosis. In this context, the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role since it either promotes or inhibits tumor progression. Our previous studies have characterized the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioblastoma (GBM). The aim of this study is to compare the immune profiles of BrM and GBM in order to identify potential differences that may be exploited in their differential\u00a0treatment. Tumor and/or blood samples were taken from 20 BrM patients and 19 GBM patients. Multi-parametric flow cytometry was used to evaluate myeloid and lymphoid cells, as well as the expression of immune checkpoints in the TME and blood. In selected cases, the immunosuppressive ability of sorted myeloid cells was tested, and the ex vivo proliferation of myeloid, lymphoid and tumor cell populations was analyzed. High frequencies of myeloid cells dominated both the BrM and GBM landscapes, but a higher presence of tumor-associated macrophages was observed in GBM, while BrM were characterized by a significant presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Exhaustion markers were highly expressed in all T cells from both primary and metastatic brain tumors. Ex vivo analysis of the cell cycle of a single sample of a BrM and of a GBM revealed subsets of proliferating tumor cells and blood-derived macrophages, but quiescent resident microglial cells and few proliferating lymphocytes. Macrophages sorted from a single lung BrM exhibited a strong immunosuppressive activity, as previously shown for primary GBM. Finally, a significant expansion of some myeloid cell subsets was observed in the blood of both GBM and BrM patients. Our results define the main characteristics of the immune profile of BrM and GBM, which are distinguished by different levels of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and lymphocytes devoid of effector function. Understanding the role of the different cells in establishing the metastatic setting is critical for improving the therapeutic efficacy of new targeted immunotherapy strategies.",

Pregnancy complicated with a Krukenberg tumor is very rare. In this report, we present two unusual cases of pregnant women with Krukenberg tumors of gastric origin. One case was a full-term pregnant woman with preeclampsia (PE) who underwent a caesarean section when bilateral enlarged ovaries were incidentally identified. Histopathology of the wedge resection biopsy showed single-ring cell carcinoma; this was followed by gastroscopy, which indicated a gastric origin. The woman received chemotherapy but died 6 months later. Another case was a pregnant woman at 30 gestational weeks with abdominal pain complicated with early-onset PE. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral enlarged ovaries and elevated tumor markers. Gastroscopy indicated linitis plastica. After an emergency caesarean section, adnexectomy was performed, and postoperative histopathology confirmed a Krukenberg tumor. The woman died 2 months after delivery. Gastrointestinal symptoms during pregnancy may indicate a malignancy of rare gastrointestinal origin. PE complicated with Krukenberg tumors in pregnancy should be considered in future studies.",

A 76-year-old man was diagnosed with NSCLC with EGFR deletion mutation in exon 19. After treatment failure with first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a T790M mutation was revealed by liquid biopsy. Hemodialysis was started three times a week because chronic renal failure worsened during treatment. Although the subsequent administration of osimertinib (80 mg daily) resulted in a tumor shrinkage and a gradual increase in the plasma concentration of osimertinib, which resulted in grade 3 general fatigue, reducing the dosage of osimertinib decreased its plasma concentration, leading to an improvement in his adverse event. Subsequently, with by adjusting the dosage while periodically measuring the plasma concentration of osimertinib, a stable therapeutic effect was sustained over the long term with no symptoms. Periodic plasma concentration measurements may be indispensable for successful treatment with osimertinib in hemodialysis patients.",

We analysed 454,712 UK Biobank participants with exome sequence and clinical data (data collected between March 2006 and June 2021). We identified participants with a self-reported family history of breast or colorectal cancer and a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in the major genes responsible for hereditary breast cancer or Lynch syndrome. We calculated survival to cancer diagnosis (controlled for sex, death, recruitment centre, screening and prophylactic surgery). Women with a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant had an increased risk of breast cancer that was higher in those with a first-degree family history (relative hazard 10.3 and 7.8, respectively) than those without (7.2 and 4.7). Penetrance to age 60 was also higher in those with a family history (44.7%, CI 32.2-59.3 and 24.1%, CI 17.5-32.6) versus those without (22.8%, CI 15.9-32.0 and 17.9%, CI 13.8-23.0). A similar pattern was seen in Lynch syndrome: individuals with a pathogenic MLH1, MSH2 or MSH6 variant had an increased risk of colorectal cancer that was significantly higher in those with a family history (relative hazard 35.6, 48.0 and 9.9) than those without (13.0, 15.4 and 7.2). Penetrance to age 60 was also higher for carriers of a pathogenic MLH1 or MSH2 variant in those with a family history (30.9%, CI 18.1-49.3 and 38.3%, CI 21.5-61.8) versus those without (20.5% CI 9.6-40.5 and 8.3% CI 2.1-30.4), but not for MSH6 (6.5% CI 2.7-15.1 with family history versus 8.3%, CI 5.1-13.2). Relative risk increases were also observed both within and across conditions. Individuals with pathogenic cancer syndrome variants may be at a less elevated risk of cancer in the absence of a first-degree family history, so in the context of results return, family history should be considered when counselling patients on the risks and benefits of potential follow-up care.

This study consisted of two breast cancer cohorts in China. The population-based cohort involved breast cancer cases diagnosed in 2000-2017 via cancer registration system, and we describe the epidemiological characteristics of the young breast cancer in China. The hospital-based cohort, patients eligible for enrollment were breast cancer in young women (\u226435 years old) from eight centres in different regions of China, diagnosed and treated for the first time in six time periods (i.e., 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2015). Patient demographic characteristics and clinical features were compared among the six time periods using a trend test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and the log-rank test was performed to compare OS and DFS. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the population-based cohort, age-specific incidence and age-standardised percentages of breast cancer cases younger than 35 years were increased. The proportion of breast cancer under the age of 35 is increasing more rapidly in rural areas than in urban areas. In the hospital-based cohort, a total of 1308 young breast cancer patients (\u226435 years old) were collected. Proportion of patients treated with adjuvant taxane or anthracycline combined with taxane is gradually increasing over the six time periods, and the proportion of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery is gradually increasing too. Meanwhile, the patients treated with combined ovarian function suppression (OFS) endocrine therapy gradually increased, and the duration of endocrine therapy gradually longer. There is an increasing trend in 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate for the total population in the six time periods between 2000 and 2015, but no significant difference in overall survival (OS) rate was observed. Early staging and longer duration of endocrine therapy were factors associated with a favorable prognosis. The incidence of younger breast cancers under 35 years of age has gradually increased and the pattern of patient care has changed significantly over time, which may contribute to the improved prognosis of younger breast cancer patients.

        "ArticleTitle": "Efficacy of a monovalent (D614) SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine with AS03 adjuvant in adults: a phase 3, multi-country study.",
        "AbstractText": "The literature on first generation COVID-19 vaccines show they were less effective against new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants). New vaccines developed against variant strains may provide cross-protection against emerging variants when used as boosters and facilitate vaccination across a range of countries, healthcare settings and populations. However, there are no data on such vaccines when used as a primary series. A global Phase 3, multi-stage efficacy study (NCT04904549) among adults (\u226518 years) was conducted in 53 research centres in eight countries (United States, Honduras, Japan, Colombia, Kenya, India, Ghana, Nepal). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of a monovalent SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine with AS03-adjuvant (10\u00a0\u03bcg of the spike (S) protein from the ancestral D614 strain) or placebo on Day 1 (D01) and Day 22 (D22). The primary efficacy endpoint was prevention of virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with symptoms of COVID-19-like illness (CLI) \u226514 days after the second injection (post-dose 2 [PD2]) in participants who were SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve on D01\u00a0+\u00a0D22. Safety and reactogenicity were also evaluated. Between May 26 and November 7, 2021, 10,114 participants received \u22651 study injection, and 9441 participants received both injections. 2108 (20.8%) participants were SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve at D01 and D22. The primary endpoint was analysed in a subset of the full analysis set (the modified full analysis set PD2 [mFAS-PD2], excluding participants who did not complete the vaccination schedule or received vaccination despite meeting one of the contraindication criteria, had onset of symptomatic COVID-19 between the first injection and before 14 days after the second injection, or participants who discontinued before 14 days after the second injection [n\u00a0=\u00a09377; vaccine, n\u00a0=\u00a04702; placebo, n\u00a0=\u00a04675]). Data were available for 2051 SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve and 7159 non-na\u00efve participants. At the cut-off date (January 28, 2022), symptomatic COVID-19 was reported in 169 na\u00efve participants (vaccine, n\u00a0=\u00a081; placebo, n\u00a0=\u00a088) \u226514 days PD2, with a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 15.3% (95% CI,\u00a0-15.8; 38.2). VE regardless of D01/D22 serostatus was 32.9% (95% CI, 15.3; 47.0) and VE in non-na\u00efve participants was 52.7% (95% CI, 31.2; 67.9). Viral genome sequencing was performed up to the data cut-off point and identified the infecting strain in 99/169 adjudicated cases in the PD2 na\u00efve population (Delta [25], Omicron [72], other variants [3], one participant had infection with both Delta and Omicron variants and has been included in the totals for both Delta and Omicron). The vaccine was well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. In the context of changing circulating viral variants, it is challenging to induce protection in na\u00efve individuals with a two-dose priming schedule based on the parental D614 strain. However, while the primary endpoint of this trial was not met, the results show that a monovalent D614 vaccine can still be of value in individuals previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

        "ArticleTitle": "A modified SELEX approach to identify DNA aptamers with binding specificity to the major histocompatibility complex presenting ovalbumin model antigen.",
        "AbstractText": "Aptamers have sparked significant interest in cell recognition because of their superior binding specificity and biocompatibility. Cell recognition can be mediated by targeting the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that presents short peptides derived from intracellular antigens. Although numerous antibodies have demonstrated a specific affinity for the peptide-MHC complex, the number of aptamers that exhibit comparable characteristics is limited. Aptamers are usually selected from large libraries via the Systemic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), an iterative process of selection and PCR amplification to enrich a pool of aptamers with high affinity. However, the success rate of aptamer identification is low, possibly due to the presence of complementary sequences or sequences rich in guanine and cytosine that are less accessible for primers. Here, we modified SELEX by employing systemic consecutive selections with minimal PCR amplification. We also modified the analysis by selecting aptamers that were identified in multiple selection rounds rather than those that are highly enriched. Using this approach, we were able to identify two aptamers with binding specificity to cells expressing the ovalbumin alloantigen as a proof of concept. These two aptamers were also discovered among the top 150 abundant candidates, despite not being highly enriched, by performing conventional SELEX. Additionally, we found that highly enriched aptamers tend to contain fractions of the primer sequence and have minimal target affinity. Candidate aptamers are easily missed in the conventional SELEX process. Therefore, our modification for SELEX may facilitate the identification of aptamers for more application in diverse biomedical fields. Significance: we modify the conventional method to improve the efficiency in the identification of the aptamer, a single strand of nucleic acid with binding specificity to the target molecule, showing as a proof of concept that this approach is particularly useful to select aptamers that can selectively bind to cells presenting a particular peptide by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the cell surface. Given that cancer cells may express mutant peptide-MHC complexes that are distinct from those expressed by normal cells, this study sheds light on the potential application of aptamers to cancer cell targeting.",

These compounds were investigated for their cytotoxic activity against cancerous human liver cell line HepG2 cells using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as a reference drug. Compound 6e had promising antiproliferative activity with an IC50 value of 1.88 \u03bcM against HepG2 cells compared to 5-FU (IC50 = 7.18 \u03bcM). The results of \u03b2-tubulin polymerization inhibition indicated that coumarin-acrylamide derivative 6e was the most active, with a percentage inhibition value of 84.34% compared to podophyllotoxin (88.19% \u03b2-tubulin inhibition). Moreover, the active coumarin-acrylamide molecule 6e exerted cell cycle cession at the G2/M phase stage of HepG2 cells. In addition, this compound produced a 15.24-fold increase in apoptotic cell induction compared to no-treatment control. These observations were supported by histopathological studies of liver sections. The conducted docking studies illustrated that 6e is perfectly positioned within the tubulin colchicine binding site, indicating a significant interaction that may underlie its potent tubulin inhibitory activity. The main objective of the study was to develop new potent anticancer compounds that might be further optimized to prevent the progression of cancer disease.",

However, its specific function in head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) has yet to be determined. The present study aimed to determine the role of IGF2BP2 in HNSCC. The expression of IGF2BP2 in HNSCC was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and detected in HNSCC tissues and cells, respectively. Gain- and loss- of function methods were employed to study the effects of IGF2BP2 on HNSCC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulating IGF2BP2 were predicted using online tools and confirmed experimentally. We showed augmented IGF2BP2 expression in HNSCC, which correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Functional studies showed that IGF2BP2 promoted HNSCC cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression while inhibiting apoptosis. We further demonstrated that IGF2BP2 could enhance HNSCC cell tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, our data revealed that miR-98-5p could directly target IGF2BP2. The interplay between IGF2BP2 and miR-98-5p is essential to drive the progression of HNSCC via the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) pathway signaling pathway. The current study revealed the oncogenic role of IGF2BP2 and provided insights into its potential mechanism in HNSCC tumorigenesis. Additionally, IGF2BP2 might represent a promising therapeutic target and serve as prognostic biomarker in patients with HNSCC.",

TMEM proteins carry out a wide variety of functions necessary to maintain cell homeostasis TMEM165 participates in glycosylation protein, TMEM88 in the development of cardiomyocytes, TMEM45A in epidermal keratinization, and TMEM74 regulating autophagy. However, for many TMEM proteins, their physiological function remains unknown. The role of these proteins is being recently investigated in cancer since transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that exits differential expression of TMEM proteins in different neoplasms concerning cancer-free tissues. Among the cellular processes in which TMEM proteins have been involved in cancer are the promotion or suppression of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, migration, intravasation/extravasation, metastasis, modulation of the immune response, and response to antineoplastic drugs. Inclusive data suggests that the participation of TMEM proteins in these cellular events could be carried out through involvement in different cell signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms not clear. This review shows a description of the involvement of TMEM proteins that promote or decrease cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells, describes those TMEM proteins for which both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter role have been identified, depending on the type of cancer in which the protein is expressed. As well as some TMEM proteins involved in chemoresistance. A better characterization of these proteins is required to improve the understanding of the tumors in which their expression and function are altered; in addition to improving the understanding of the role of these proteins in cancer will show those TMEM proteins be potential candidates as biomarkers of response to chemotherapy or prognostic biomarkers or as potential therapeutic targets in cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "The tumor mutational burden (TMB) is high in melanomas owing to UV-induced oncogenesis. While a high TMB is a predictive biomarker of response to PD-1 inhibitors, it may be associated with the rise of resistant clones to targeted therapy over time. We hypothesized that survivals may depend on both the sun-exposure profile of the site of primary melanoma and the type of systemic treatment. Patients were screened from MelBase, a multicenter biobank dedicated to the prospective follow-up of stage III/IV melanoma. All patients with a known cutaneous primary melanoma who received a 1st-line systemic treatment by immunotherapy or targeted therapy were included (2013-2019). Outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 973 patients received either anti PD-1(n=466), anti CTLA-4(n=143), a combination of both (n=118), or targeted therapies (n=246). Patients' characteristics at treatment initiation were: male (62%), median age of 62, AJCC stage IV (84%). Median follow-up was 15.5 months. The primary melanoma was located on chronically sun-exposed skin in 202 patients (G1: head neck), on intermittently sun-exposed skin in 699 patients (G2: trunk, arms, legs), and on sun-protected areas in 72 patients (G3: palms, soles). Median PFS was significantly higher in G1 under anti PD-1 treatment (8.7 months vs 3.3 and 3.4 months for G2 and G3, respectively) (p=0.011). PFS did not significantly differ in other groups. Similarly, median OS was significantly higher in G1 receiving 1st line anti PD-1 treatment (45.6 months vs 31.6 and 21.4 months for G2 and G3) (p=0.04), as opposed to 1st line targeted therapy (19.5 months vs 16.3 and 21.1 months for G1, G2 and G3 respectively). Our study confirms that immunotherapy with anti PD-1 is particularly recommended for melanomas originating from chronically sun-exposed areas, but this finding needs to be confirmed by further research.",

        "AbstractText": "The role of cranial radiation therapy with hippocampus avoidance (HA-CRT) in neurocognitive function (NCF), brain metastasis (BM), and overall survival (OS) in lung cancer remains unclear. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of HA-CRT in lung cancer. Data from studies on hippocampal-avoidance prophylactic cranial irradiation (HA-PCI) and whole brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) were pooled. A total of 14 studies, including 5 randomized controlled trials, were included. The focus of NCF was mainly via the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised or the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test. At 6 months post-radiotherapy, the pooled proportion of participants with decline in the performance of total recall, delayed recall, and discrimination in neurocognitive tests were 0.22 (95% CI 0.15, 0.29), 0.20 (95% CI 0.13, 0.27), and 0.14 (95% CI 0.05, 0.24) respectively. After 12 months, the proportion were 0.16 (95% CI 0.08, 0.23), 0.10 (95% CI 0.04, 0.16), and 0.04 (95% CI 0, 0.09) respectively. For HA zone relapse, the RR of HA-CRT versus CRT was 2.72 (95% CI 0.53, 13.87), and for 2-year BM, it was 1.20 (95% CI 0.82, 1.75). Regarding HA-PCI in SCLC, the 1-year BM rate was 0.12 (95% CI 0.07, 0.17), and the 2-year BM rate was 0.20 (95% CI 0.16, 0.25). For HA-WBRT in NSCLC with BM, the 2-year intracranial progression rate was 0.38 (95% CI 0.13, 0.62). There was no significant difference in OS between HA-CRT and CRT. HA-CRT appears to be safe in lung cancer, but it may not outperform conventional CRT. Larger RCTs comparing HA-CRT and CRT are warranted. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022360890, identifier CRD42022360890.",

Here, we reviewed cases of biopsy-proven acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of this condition. We conducted a pooled analysis of clinical cases of ICI-related biopsy-proven ATIN up to 1 May 2022. We collected data on clinical characteristics, AKI, biopsy findings, laboratory examinations, and renal outcomes. Eighty-five patients (61.4 \u00b1 19 years, 56 male) were evaluated. Melanoma was the most prevalent diagnosis (51%), followed by non-small cell lung cancer (30%). ICI treatment consisted of PD-1, PDL-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab), and CTLA-4 inhibitors (i) (ipilimumab) or combination PD-1i+CTLA4i. Renal toxicity developed after a median of four cycles of therapy. Fifty-one patients (65.5%) developed the most severe form of AKI- stage 3, including five patients requiring dialysis. All the 19 patients treated with dual ICI blockade developed AKI-stage 3, compared with 29 patients out of the 60 receiving a single agent (p<0.001). Most events were managed with corticosteroids associated with ICI withdrawal. In 15 patients ICI was restarted, but in six (40%) AKI recurred. Overall, 32 patients (40%) presented a complete renal recovery, which chance was inversely associated with dual ICI blockade (OR 0.15, 95CI 0.03-0.7, p=0.01). ICI-related ATIN may develop late after the therapy initiation, presenting as severe AKI, particularly in patients with dual ICI blockade. Although this complication may be partially reversible, concerns remain about the renal function sequelae and the possibility of restarting ICI treatment.",

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for original studies published until 10 November 2022, and the studies satisfying the inclusion criteria were included. Characteristics of included studies and radiomics approach and data for constructing 2 \u00d7 2 tables were extracted. The radiomics quality score (RQS) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) were utilized for the quality assessment of included studies. Overall sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to assess diagnostic accuracy. The subgroup analysis and Spearman's correlation coefficient was done for exploration of heterogeneity sources. Fifteen studies with 7,010 GC patients were included. We conducted analyses on both radiomics signature and combined (based on signature and clinical features) models. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and AUC of radiomics models compared to combined models were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.67-0.82) versus 0.81 (95% CI, 0.75-0.86), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86) versus 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79-0.89), 13 (95% CI, 7-23) versus 23 (95% CI, 13-42), and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.86) versus 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.92), respectively. The meta-analysis indicated a significant heterogeneity among studies. The subgroup analysis revealed that arterial phase CT scan, tumoral and nodal regions of interest (ROIs), automatic segmentation, and two-dimensional (2D) ROI could improve diagnostic accuracy compared to venous phase CT scan, tumoral-only ROI, manual segmentation, and 3D ROI, respectively. Overall, the quality of studies was quite acceptable based on both QUADAS-2 and RQS tools. CT scan-based radiomics approach has a promising potential for the prediction of LNM in GC patients preoperatively as a non-invasive diagnostic tool.

        "AbstractText": "Radiotherapy (RT) is performed in approximately 75% of patients with cancer, and its efficacy is often hampered by the low tolerance of the surrounding normal tissues. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential to widen the therapeutic window using \"very short\" radiation treatment delivery (from a conventional dose rate between 0.5 Gy/min and 2 Gy/min to more than 40 Gy/s) causing a significant increase of normal tissue tolerance without varying the tumor effect. This phenomenon is called \"FLASH Effect (FE)\" and has been discovered by using electrons. Although several physical, dosimetric, and radiobiological aspects need to be clarified, current preclinical \"in vivo\" studies have reported a significant protective effect of FLASH RT on neurocognitive function, skin toxicity, lung fibrosis, and bowel injury. Therefore, the current radiobiological premises lay the foundation for groundbreaking potentials in clinical translation, which could be addressed to an initial application of Low Energy Electron FLASH (LEE) for the treatment of superficial tumors to a subsequent Very High Energy Electron FLASH (VHEE) for the treatment of deep tumors. Herein, we report a clinical investigational scenario that, if supported by preclinical studies, could be drawn in the near future.",

Computed Tomography (CT) imaging revealed the presence of a solid mass in the left kidney along with retroperitoneal metastasis. The patient received axitinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR-TKI), as first-line neoadjuvant therapy. Subsequent testing confirmed positive expression of programmed death-1 protein L1 (PDL1), leading to the addition of tislelizumab, a PD1 inhibitor, to the treatment regimen. After 8 months, the patient's tumor size and metastases exhibited significant reduction, providing a favorable opportunity for subsequent surgical intervention. The tumor was classified as IV (pT3aN0M1) based on the pathologic stage of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC, 8th edition, 2017).

        "AbstractText": "Extracellular vesicles could serve as a non-invasive biomarker for early cancer detection. However, limited methods to quantitate cancer-derived vesicles in the native state remain a significant barrier to clinical translation. This research aims to develop a rapid, one-step immunoaffinity approach to quantify HCC exosomes directly from a small serum volume. HCC-derived exosomes in the serum were captured using fluorescent phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies targeted to GPC3 and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Total and HCC-specific exosomes were then quantified in culture supernatant or patient-derived serums using fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis (F-NTA). The performance of HCC exosome quantification in the serum was compared with the tumor size determined by MRI. Initially we tested the detection limits of the F-NTA using synthetic fluorescent and non-fluorescent beads. The assay showed an acceptable sensitivity with a detection range of 104-108 particles/mL. Additionally, the combination of immunocapture followed by size-exclusion column purification allows the isolation of smaller-size EVs and quantification by F-NTA. Our assay demonstrated that HCC cell culture releases a significantly higher quantity of GPC3 or GPC3+AFP positive EVs (100-200 particles/cell) compared to non-HCC culture (10-40 particles/cell) (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively). The F-NTA enables absolute counting of HCC-specific exosomes in the clinical samples with preserved biological immunoreactivity. The performance of F-NTA was clinically validated in serum from patients \u00b1 cirrhosis and with confirmed HCC. F-NTA quantification data show selective enrichment of AFP and GPC3 positive EVs in HCC serum compared to malignancy-free cirrhosis (AUC values for GPC3, AFP, and GPC3/AFP were found 0.79, 0.71, and 0.72 respectively). The MRI-confirmed patient cohort indicated that there was a positive correlation between total tumor size and GPC3-positive exosome concentration (r:0.78 and p<0.001).

Sintilimab, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody is specific for the immune checkpoint protein programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1). It is a common medication adopted for treating Hodgkin's lymphoma and NSCLC. The adverse effects associated with the use of monoclonal antibodies should be closely monitored and in the current report, the use of sintilimab for treating NSCLC led to skin-associated adverse effects such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Genetic testing showed that genes such as KRAS, CREBBP, NTRK1, RAF1, and TP53 were mutated. Initial visible symptom included the formation of a vesicular rash on the skin that had spread to the upper limbs, chest, and dorsum 1 week after the administration of sintilimab. The patient received anti-inflammatory agents to prevent worsening of the rashes and further infections. When the vesicles in back and limbs enlarged and the neck skin began to desquamate, the patient was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and sintilimab-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. Toxic epidermal necrolysis was diagnosed via clinical symptoms and physical examination. The patient also reported the symptoms of oral mucositis. As soon as the dose of sintilimab was reduced to 20 mg/day, the skin-associated condition of the patient began to improve. Although the lump in the lungs decreased considerably 45 days after initial administration of sintilimab, the medication was stopped from use as soon as the skin-related symptoms improved after its withdrawal. This report suggests that close monitoring, personal care, and proper use of medications such as sintilimab should be implemented to avoid such rare skin-associated toxicities as an adverse effect.",

Twenty-six patients with bladder cancer were included in this study, and 8 were confirmed by secondary electroresection, including 6 cases positive for FISH positive and 2 negative for FISH. Besides, among the subjects, 18 were without tumor recurrence, including 1 case with positive FISH results and 17 with negative FISH results. Tumor recurrence was diagnosed in 85.71% (6/7) of FISH-positive patients in secondary electroresection while only 10.53% (2/19) of FISH-negative patients were found to develop tumor recurrence in the secondary electroresection. The sensitivity of FISH for the detection of bladder cancer before secondary electroresection was 75%, with a specificity of 94.44%, and an accuracy of 88.46%. A 6-month follow-up revealed that 2 of the 8 recurrent patients underwent radical resection of bladder cancer, and the remaining 6 patients had no recurrence, as confirmed by regular bladder perfusion and microscopy. In the 18 non-recurrent patients during secondary electroresection, no recurrence developed. Urine FISH can achieve a high detection rate and specificity for secondary electroresection of bladder cancer. If a bladder cancer patient who are indicated for secondary electroresection is negative for urine FISH, the recurrence rate after secondary electroresection will be low, and the cystoscopy can be performed before deciding whether to perform secondary electroresection.",

        "AbstractText": "Bladder cancer represents the most common malignancy of the urinary system, posing a significant threat to patients' life. Animal models and two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, among other traditional models, have been used for years to study various aspects of bladder cancer. However, these methods are subject to various limitations when mimicking the tumor microenvironment in vivo, thus hindering the further improvement of bladder cancer treatments. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) culture models have attracted extensive attention since they overcome the shortcomings of their traditional counterparts. Most importantly, 3D culture models more accurately reproduce the tumor microenvironment in the human body because they can recapitulate the cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. 3D culture models can thereby help us gain deeper insight into the bladder cancer. The 3D culture models of tumor cells can extend the culture duration and allow for co-culturing with different cell types. Study of patient-specific bladder cancer mutations and subtypes is made possible by the ability to preserve cells isolated from particular patients in 3D culture models. It will be feasible to develop customized treatments that target relevant signaling pathways or biomarkers. This article reviews the development, application, advantages, and limitations of traditional modeling systems and 3D culture models used in the study of bladder cancer and discusses the potential application of 3D culture models.",

Mounting evidence has demonstrated that laparoscopic and robotic-assisted RC with extended pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is a viable alternative for managing invasive bladder cancer. In this review, we summarized recent advances and critically assessed the minimally invasive approaches and risk factors associated with extended PLND in patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic-assisted RC. The findings indicated that laparoscopic and robotic-assisted PLND, employing either a standard or extended approach, is technically feasible and offers benefits such as minimal invasiveness, superior visualization, reduced blood loss, and expedited recovery. The risk factors involved in the laparoscopic extended PLND are minimal. Clinically, laparoscopic and robotic-assisted extended PLND is significantly advantageous in that it sticks to the principles of open surgery and respects anatomical boundaries. Nevertheless, laparoscopic and robotic-assisted extended PLND is technically challenging and necessitate extended operation time. Furthermore, large-scale, prospective, multicenter trials are warranted to validate the long-term efficacy of laparoscopic and robotic-assisted extended PLND in terms of disease-specific survival.",

Their clinicopathological characteristics were collected from medical records. The indicators for the efficacy of everolimus were progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR). We collected 79 HER2-enriched patients that were treated with everolimus-based therapy, 43 of whom were mTPBC. The most commonly used therapeutic combinations was everolimus plus endocrine therapy (18/43, 41.9%). Among all combinations, everolimus plus chemotherapy plus trastuzumab developed the longest PFS of 10.9\u2009months (95% CI: 1.5-20.3).

Historically, ASPS and TFE3-rearranged PEComa are considered two distinctive entities despite their known morphological overlap. However, recent studies have suggested a potential histogenetic relationship between them, and several neoplasms that showed morphological features more closely fit PEComa rather than ASPS but harboured ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion have been documented. In this study, we report three cases of PEComa with ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion. Clinicopathological features were assessed and partner agnostic targeted next-generation sequencing on clinically validated platforms were performed. The patients are two females and one male with age at presentation ranging from\u00a021 to 51\u2009years. All three tumours were located in the viscera (rectum, kidney and cervix). On a relatively limited follow-up period (range\u2009=\u20099-15\u2009months), all patients are alive without evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. The neoplasms were composed of tight nested architecture of epithelioid clear cells separated by a delicate vascular network, two of which were associated with sheets of plump spindle cells, and none showed significant discohesive tumour morphology. Immunohistochemically, in addition to TFE3 protein, all three neoplasms demonstrated co-expression of melan-A and smooth muscle actin. RNA-sequencing identified ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion in all three cases that were confirmed by subsequent fluorescence in-situ hybridisation analyses.

The MTN-034/REACH trial offered AGYW a menu of adherence support strategies and achieved high adherence to both daily oral PrEP and the monthly dapivirine vaginal ring. Understanding how these strategies promoted product use could inform the design of adherence support systems in programmatic settings. REACH was a randomized crossover trial evaluating the safety of and adherence to the ring and oral PrEP among 247 HIV-negative AGYW (ages 16-21) in South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe from January 2019 to September 2021 (NCT03593655). Adherence support included monthly counselling sessions with drug-level feedback (DLF) plus optional daily short message service (SMS) reminders, weekly phone or SMS check-ins, peer support clubs, \"peer buddies\" and additional counselling. Counsellors documented adherence support choices and counselling content on standardized forms. Through focus groups, serial in-depth interviews (IDIs) and single IDIs (n = 119 total), we explored participants' experiences with adherence support and how it encouraged product use. Participants received counselling at nearly all visits. DLF was provided at 54.3% of sessions and, across sites, 49%-68% received results showing high adherence for oral PrEP, and 73%-89% for the ring. The most popular support strategies were in-person clubs and weekly calls, followed by online clubs, additional counselling and SMS. Preferences differed across sites but were similar for both products. Qualitative results demonstrated that the REACH strategies supported adherence by providing information about HIV and PrEP, continually motivating participants, and supporting the development of behavioural skills and self-efficacy, aligning with the Information, Motivation, and Behavioural Skills (IMB) model. Effectiveness was supported by three foundational pillars: strong interpersonal relationships with counsellors; ongoing, easily accessible support and resources; and establishing trust in the counsellors and study products through counsellor relationships, peer-to-peer exchange and DLF. Implementation programmes could support effective PrEP use by offering a small menu of counsellor- and peer-based support options that are youth-friendly and developmentally appropriate. The same menu options can support both ring and oral PrEP users, though content should be tailored to the individual products.",

        "AbstractText": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA, DNA shed by cancer cells) is emerging as one of the most transformative cancer biomarkers discovered to-date. Although potentially useful at all the phases of cancer detection and patient management, one of its most exciting possibilities is as a relatively noninvasive pan-cancer screening test. Preliminary findings with ctDNA tests such as Galleri or CancerSEEK suggest that they have high specificity (> 99.0%) for malignancy. Their sensitivity varies depending on the type of cancer and stage of disease but it is generally low in patients with stage I disease. A major advantage of ctDNA over existing screening strategies is the potential ability to detect multiple cancer types in a single test. A limitation of most studies published to-date is that they are predominantly case-control investigations that were carried out in patients with a previous diagnosis of malignancy and that used apparently healthy subjects as controls. Consequently, the reported sensitivities, specificities and positive predictive values might be lower if the tests are used for screening in asymptomatic populations, that is, in the population where these tests are likely be employed. To demonstrate clinical utility in an asymptomatic population, these tests must be shown to reduce cancer mortality without causing excessive overdiagnosis in a large randomized prospective randomized trial. Such trials are currently ongoing for Galleri and CancerSEEK.",

OLs in group B compared to group A, were smaller in size (<2\u2009cm; p\u2009<\u20090.001), showed more hyperkeratosis (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and less moderate/severe dysplasia (p\u2009<\u20090.001). MT occurred in 45 (20%) patients: 32 (35%) in group A, five (6%) in group B and eight (17%) in group C. There was no significant difference in clinical tumour size between group A (median: 15\u2009mm, range: 1-40) and group B (median: 10\u2009mm, range: 3-25; p\u2009=\u20090.496). Tumour size was smaller for patients in groups A and B (median: 10\u2009mm, range 1-40) compared to group C (median: 33\u2009mm, range: 3-100; p\u2009=\u20090.003). There was a positive correlation between tumour size and interval between the last visit in all patients (p\u2009=\u20090.022). Regular follow-up of OL resulted in early detection of MT. If properly selected, follow-up of OL performed by the dentist seems feasible.",

        "AbstractText": "Tumour grade is a critical prognostic parameter for guiding the management of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In 2004, the World Health Organisation (WHO) adopted a binary (low-grade/high-grade) grading system to replace the three-tier (grades 1-3) system used to grade urothelial carcinoma since 1973. However, there is significant global variation in the grading of urothelial carcinoma. Some pathology and clinical guidelines recommend reporting of the WHO 1973 and 2004 grades in parallel, while others require reporting only of the WHO 2004 grade. This variation in pathology practice is clinically significant, because the two grading systems are not readily translatable. Some experts have proposed novel systems for grading urothelial carcinoma that involve splitting of the WHO 1973 and 2004 grade categories. The arguments for and against splitting urothelial carcinomas into two-, three- and four-grade categories are independently discussed by the three authors.",

A decision-analytic model that based on the Chinese health-care system perspective was conducted to evaluate the economic benefits for the two competing first-line treatment. The clinical survival and safety data were obtained from the ASTRUM-005 trial, cost and utility values were gathered from the local charges and previously published study. Both cost and utility values were discounted at an annual rate of 5%. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the model results. Serplulimab plus chemotherapy could bring additional 0.25 QALYs with the marginal cost of $37,569.32, resulting in an ICER of $147,908.74 per additional QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that model results were robust. Subgroup analyses revealed that adding serplulimab to first-line chemotherapy were unlikely to be the cost-effective option for all subgroup patients. Serplulimab plus chemotherapy was unlikely to be the cost-effective first-line strategy compared with chemotherapy alone for patients with ES-SCLC in China.

SCC can readily be diagnosed using histomorphology alone in keratinising SCC. Confirmatory immunohistochemical analyses should always be applied in non-keratinising and basaloid tumours to exclude differential diagnoses, most prominently adenocarcinoma and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, which may have important therapeutic consequences. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification 2015, the diagnosis of SCC can be rendered in resections of morphologically ambiguous tumours with squamous immunophenotype. In biopsies and cytology preparations in the same setting the\u00a0current guidelines propose a diagnosis of 'non-small-cell carcinoma, favour SCC' in TTF1-negative and p40-positive tumours to acknowledge a possible sampling bias and restrict extended immunohistochemical evaluation in order to preserve tissue for\u00a0molecular testing. Most SCC feature a molecular 'tobacco-smoke signature' with enrichment in GG\u2009> TT\u00a0mutations, in line with the strong epidemiological association of SCC with smoking. Targetable mutations are extremely rare but they do occur, in particular in younger and non- or light-smoking patients, warranting molecular investigations. Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) is a poorly differentiated SCC with a syncytial growth pattern and a usually prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and frequent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association. In this review, we describe the morphological and molecular characteristics of SCC and LEC and discuss the most pertinent differential diagnoses.",

This study employed a qualitative descriptive method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 30 female breast cancer survivors in Abuja, Nigeria. The three major themes were views about being a cancer survivor, cancer can be stigmatizing, and life after cancer diagnosis and therapy. We argue that cancer-related identity and cancer-related stigma are key factors with help-seeking and quality-of-life implications.

        "AbstractText": "Currently, lung cancer is treated by the highest number of therapeutic options and the benefits are based on multiple large-scale sequencing studies, translational research and new drug development, which has promoted our understanding of the molecular pathology of lung cancer. According to the driver alterations, different characteristics have been revealed, such as differences in ethnic prevalence, median age and alteration patterns. Consequently, beyond traditional chemoradiotherapy, molecular-targeted therapy and treatment with immune check-point inhibitors (ICI) also became available major therapeutic options. Interestingly, clinical results suggest that the recently established therapies target distinct lung cancer proportions, particularly between the EGFR/ALK and PD-1/PD-L1-positive subsets, e.g. the kinase inhibitors target driver mutation-positive tumours, whereas driver mutation-negative tumours respond to ICI treatment. These therapeutic efficacy-related differences might be explained by the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer. Addictive driver mutations promote tumour formation with powerful transformation performance, resulting in a low tumour mutation burden, reduced immune surveillance, and subsequent poor response to ICIs. In contrast, regular tobacco smoke exposure repeatedly injures the proximal airway epithelium, leading to accumulated genetic alterations. In the latter pathway, overgrowth due to alteration and immunological exclusion against neoantigens is initially balanced. However, tumours could be generated from certain clones that outcompete immunological exclusion and outgrow the others. Consequently, this cancer type responds to immune check-point treatment. These pathogenic differences are explained well by the two-compartment model, focusing upon the anatomical and functional composition of distinct cellular components between the terminal respiratory unit and the air-conducting system.",

Previously the genome-wide association study identified 17 955 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at APA quantitative trait loci (apaQTL) in bladder cancer. We found that gene symbols of APA affected by apaQTL-SNPs were closely correlated with cancer signaling pathways, high mutational burden, and immune infiltration. Association analysis showed that apaQTL-SNPs rs34402449 C>A, rs2683524 C>T, and rs11540872 C>G were significantly associated with susceptibility to bladder cancer (rs34402449: OR = 1.355, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.159-1.583, P = 1.33\u00d710 -4; rs2683524: OR = 1.378, 95% CI: 1.164-1.632, P = 2.03\u00d710 -4; rs11540872: OR = 1.472, 95% CI: 1.193-1.815, P = 3.06\u00d710 -4).

We found that PRR13, being demonstrated the most significant effect on cell proliferation in bladder cancer cell lines, was more highly expressed in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, the rs2683524 T allele was correlated with shorter 3' untranslated regions of PRR13 and increased PRR13 expression levels.

In this work, novel series of 5-methyl-2-(2-(-(6-nitrobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)methylene) hydrazinyl)-4-(aryldiazenyl)thiazoles (4a-f) were prepared via the reaction of hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a-f with 2-((6-nitrobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)methylene)hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (1) in dioxane and employing triethylamine as basic catalyst. Following the same procedure, bisthiazoles (6, 8, and 10) have been synthesized by utilizing bis-hydrazonoyl chlorides (5, 7, and 9) and carbothioamide 1 in a molar ratio (1:2), respectively. The distinctive features in the structure of isolated products were elucidated by spectroscopic tools and elemental analyses.

However, the pharmacokinetic issues associated with resveratrol, such as its low bioavailability, have piqued the attention of researchers in developing novel derivatives. A novel phytoalexin derivative, RsvD1, was successfully synthesized using resveratrol extracted from green grape peels as a precursor to investigate its anti-breast cancer efficacy on Estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative breast cancer cells. The comparative analysis revealed that RsvD1 exhibited remarkable radical scavenging ability (IC50 = 2.21 \u03bcg/mL), surpassing the control, Trolox (IC50 = 6.3 \u03bcg/mL). Furthermore, RsvD1 demonstrated enhanced and selective antiproliferative activity against ER-positive MCF-7 cells (IC50 = 20.09 \u03bcg/mL) compared to resveratrol, the parent molecule (IC50 = 30.90 \u03bcg/mL). Further investigations unveiled that RsvD1 induced apoptosis and DNA damage in MCF-7 cells, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase after 24 hours of incubation. RTqPCR gene expression analysis indicated that RsvD1 down-regulated the CAXII (ER-dependent) genes. In silico predictions demonstrated that RsvD1 possesses promising potential as a drug candidate due to its drug-like characteristics and favourable ADMET profile. Moreover, molecular docking studies provided insights into the theoretical binding mode between RsvD1 and ER\u03b1 protein. The study highlights the therapeutic potential of the synthesized resveratrol derivative, RsvD1, positioning it as a promising scaffold for developing novel analogues with improved therapeutic properties and selectivity, specifically targeting ER+ breast cancer cells. Moreover, the compound's non-cytotoxic yet antiproliferative properties, coupled with its capability to induce programmed cell death and cell cycle arrest, enhance its potential as a highly effective drug candidate. As a result, this paves a promising path for the development of innovative and selective inhibitors targeting ER+ breast cancer with enhanced efficacy.",

Thus, in pursuit of the bioactive compounds, the most potential active extract from our previous study was purified. Furthermore, the anticancer properties of the isolated compound karanjin were studied and aimed for apoptosis and restraining growth. A novel method was developed through column chromatography for isolation and purification of the compound karanjin from leaf chloroform extract. The purified component was then characterised using FTIR, mass spectrometry, and NMR. An MTT-based cytotoxicity assay was used to analyse cell cytotoxicity, whereas fluorescence staining was used for apoptosis and reactive oxygen species inhibition quantification. Furthermore, the real-time PCR assay was used to determine the molecular mechanism of action in cells causing cytotoxicity induced by karanjin dosing. The anticancer activity of karanjin in A549 cell line exhibited prominent activity revealing IC50 value of 4.85 \u03bcM.

Hence, the present study aimed to improve the stability of ISL@ZLH NPs using cryoprotectants that can withstand long storage times and are effective in TNBC treatment by creating an efficient oral drug delivery system. Freeze-dried ISL@ZLH NP powder was prepared by solvent evaporation, followed by the addition of trehalose and sucrose. The freeze-dried ISL@ZLH NP pow was optimized and characterized. The anti-TNBC efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the ISL@ZLH NP-pow were examined in plasma and organs, compared with those of aqueous ISL@ZLH NPs. The ideal particle size of the ISL@ZLH NP pow was 118 nm, which was not filtered out by the glomerulus and allowed the drug to be delivered to the lesions more effectively. Cellular uptake and biodistribution of the ISL@ZLH NP-pow in vivo and in vitro showed prolonged storage in the organs. In addition, cryopreserved ISL@ZLH NP-treated tumors showed significant anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects through the downregulation of the PI3K-Akt-mToR and MMP2/9 signaling pathways. These results suggest that oral ingestion of cryopreserved ISL@ZLH NP has the potential for longterm storage and can be employed as a clinical therapeutic approach to treat TNBC.",

Although there are several options for the treatment of HNSC, there is still a lack of better biomarkers to accurately predict the response to treatment and thus be more able to correctly treat the therapeutic modality. First, we typed cases from the TCGA-HNSC cohort into subtypes by a Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization (BayesNMF)-based consensus clustering approach. Subsequently, genomic and proteomic data from HNSC cell lines were integrated to identify biomarkers of response to targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Finally, associations between HNSC subtypes and CD8 T-cell-associated effector molecules, common immune checkpoint genes, were compared to assess the potential of HNSC subtypes as clinically predictive immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The 500 HNSC cases from TCGA were put through a consensus clustering approach to identify six HNSC expression subtypes. In addition, subtypes with unique proteomics and dependency profiles were defined based on HNSC cell line histology and proteomics data. Subtype 4 (S4) exhibits hyperproliferative and hyperimmune properties, and S4-associated cell lines show specific vulnerability to ADAT2, EIF5AL1, and PAK2. PD-L1 and CASP1 inhibitors have therapeutic potential in S4, and we have also demonstrated that S4 is more responsive to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer has emerged as the most widespread cancer globally surpassing lung cancer, and has become a primary cause of mortality among women. While MFHAS1 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases, its precise involvement in breast cancer remains unclear. This study endeavors to elucidate the regulatory function of MFHAS1 in breast cancer cell pyroptosis and the associated molecular mechanisms. Our findings indicate that the inhibition of MFHAS1 can impede the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells, while also inducing cell pyroptosis via caspase1-dependent activation of GSDMD. This process results in the cleavage of cell membranes, leading to the release of inflammatory factors and LDH. Subsequent investigations revealed that the silencing of MFHAS1 can promote JNK phosphorylation, thereby activating the JNK signaling cascade. Notably, this effect can be counteracted by the JNK-specific inhibitor sp600125. Ultimately, our investigation substantiated the identical function of MFHAS1 in breast cancer tissue derived from animal models. To summarize, our findings demonstrate that the inhibition of MFHAS1 elicits pyroptosis in human breast cancer cells through the facilitation of JNK phosphorylation and the activation of the downstream NF-\u03baB/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling cascade, thereby proposing the prospect of MFHAS1 as a viable therapeutic target for breast cancer.",

This study investigated the hepatoprotective effect and mechanism of the Sedum Lineare Thunb. n-butanol phase (SLNP) on HF in rats. Animals were intraperitoneally injected with thioacetamide solution twice a week for 8 weeks to prepare an HF model and were administered the corresponding drugs or an equal volume of normal saline by intragastric administration once a day for 8 weeks. Liver function, hydroxyproline and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), Na+-K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase were analyzed using colorimetric methods. Moreover, mRNA expression and protein levels in the liver tissue were detected via quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The results showed that SLNP could effectively improve the liver function of rats with HF and significantly reduce the content of hydroxyproline; the mRNA expression and protein levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), collagen I, III, and IV, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), Smad2/3, and Smad4 were also significantly reduced. Simultaneously, SLNP significantly increased the activities of SOD, Na+-K+- ATPase, and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase in the rat liver tissues, whereas it reduced the levels of MDA and SOD in the serum and liver tissues. This study revealed that SLNP elicits an anti-fibrotic effect by inhibiting oxidative stress and suppressing stellate cell activation, thereby reducing the formation and deposition of the extracellular matrix. The TGF-\u03b21/SMADs signaling pathway may be involved in this process.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Crucial Role of microRNAs as New Targets for Amelogenesis Disorders Detection.",
        "AbstractText": "Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) refers to a heterogeneous group of conditions with multiple factors which contribute to the hypomineralisation of enamel. Preventive measures are necessary to predict this pathology. Prospects for preventive medicine are closely related to the search for new informative methods for diagnosing a human disease. MicroRNAs are prominent for the non-invasive diagnostic platform. The aim of the review is to review the heterogeneous factors involved in amelogenesis and to select the microRNA panel associated with the AI type. We used DIANA Tools (algorithms, databases and software) for interpreting and archiving data in a systematic framework ranging from the analysis of expression regulation from deep sequencing data to the annotation of miRNA regulatory elements and targets (https://dianalab. e-ce.uth.gr/). In our study, based on a gene panel associated with the AI types, twenty-four miRNAs were identified for the hypoplastic type (supplement), thirty-five for hypocalcified and forty-- nine for hypomaturation AI. The selection strategy included the microRNA search with multiple targets using the AI type's gene panel. Key proteins, calcium-dependent and genetic factors were analysed to reveal their role in amelogenesis. The role of extracellular non-coding RNA sequences with multiple regulatory functions seems to be the most attractive. We chose the list of microRNAs associated with the AI genes. We found four microRNAs (hsa-miR-27a-3p, hsa-miR-375, hsa-miR-16-5p and hsamiR- 146a-5p) for the gene panel, associated with the hypoplastic type of AI; five microRNAs (hsa- miR-29c-3p, hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-1343-3p, hsa-miR-335-5p, and hsa-miR-16-5p - for hypocalcified type of AI, and seven ones (hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-147a, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsamiR- 429, hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-335-5p) - for hypomaturation. It was revealed that hsa-miR-16-5p is included in three panels specific for both hypoplastic, hypocalcified, and hypomaturation types. Hsa-miR-146a-5p is associated with hypoplastic and hypomaturation type of AI, which is associated with the peculiarities of the inflammatory response immune response. In turn, hsa-miR-335-5p associated with hypocalcified and hypomaturation type of AI. Liquid biopsy approaches are a promising way to reduce the economic cost of treatment for these patients in modern healthcare. Unique data exist about the role of microRNA in regulating amelogenesis. The list of microRNAs that are associated with AI genes and classified by AI types has been uncovered. The target gene analysis showed the variety of functions of selected microRNAs, which explains the multiple heterogeneous mechanisms in amelogenesis. Predisposition to mineralisation problems is a programmed event. Many factors determine the manifestation of this problem. Additionally, it is necessary to remember the variable nature of the changes, which reduces the prediction accuracy. Therefore, models based on liquid biopsy and microRNAs make it possible to take into account these factors and their influence on the mineralisation. The found data needs further investigation.",

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer is a pervasive and persistent issue worldwide, with the highest morbidity and mortality among all cancers for many years. In the medical field, computer tomography (CT) images of the lungs are currently recognized as the best way to help doctors detect lung nodules and thus diagnose lung cancer. U-Net is a deep learning network with an encoder-decoder structure, which is extensively employed for medical image segmentation and has derived many improved versions. However, these advancements do not utilize various feature information from all scales, and there is still room for future enhancement. In this study, we proposed a new model called Blend U-Net, which incorporates nested structures, redesigned long and short skip connections, and deep supervisions. The nested structures and the long and short skip connections combined characteristic information of different levels from feature maps in all scales, while the deep supervision learning hierarchical representations from all-scale concatenated feature maps. Additionally, we employed a mixed loss function to obtain more accurate results. We evaluated the performance of the Blend U-Net against other architectures on the publicly available Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) dataset. Moreover, the accuracy of the segmentation was verified by using the dice coefficient. Blend U-Net with a boost of 0.83 points produced the best outcome in a number of baselines. Based on the results, our method achieves superior performance in terms of dice coefficient compared to other methods and demonstrates greater proficiency in segmenting lung nodules of varying sizes.",

Primary hepatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PHNENs) are rare diseases, and most of the relevant studies are case reports. Characterized by no specific clinical symptoms, PHNENs not only have a low preoperative diagnosis rate with great difficulty in early diagnosis but are frequently misdiagnosed as primary hepatic cancer. 15 PHNEN patients were enrolled, with 10 cases in the G2 stage and 5 cases in the G3 stage. The imaging and clinicopathological information of 15 patients pathologically diagnosed with PHNENs was retrospectively reviewed. The average age of the patients enrolled was 46.14\u00b118.24 years, and the average tumor size was 91.00\u00b161.17 mm. 13 cases showed nodules or masses, 8 cases were located in the periphery of the liver, showing capsule depression and subcapsular effusion signs. CT enhanced scan showed heterogeneous and obvious enhancement in 9 arterial-phase cases, 2 cases in arterial and portal venous phases both saw mild enhancement; the enhancement degree of lesions in the G2 stage in the arterial phase was significantly higher than in the G3 stage. Gd-EOB-DTPA dynamic enhanced MRI was conducted on 3 cases, and scattered lesions with heterogeneous and slight hyperintensity were observed in the hepatobiliaryspecific lesions. Image manifestations showed diffuse lesions in 2 cases, with heterogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase and decreased enhancement in the portal venous phase by the dynamic enhanced scan. PHNENs were the imaging characteristics of PHNENs. The CT-enhanced scanning during the arterial phase may provide a certain reference for pathological grading (G2 and G3 grades). Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI is helpful for PHNEN diagnosis.",

Patients were excluded prior to, or up to 2\u2009years after a diagnosis with IBD, Celiac disease, IBS, all forms of colorectal cancer (primary and secondary), and anal cancer. Medical records were collected and data on clinical findings with assessments, X-ray examinations, endoscopies and laboratory results were reviewed. The basis of coding was compared with internationally accepted definitions for colonic diverticular disease. Positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated. The overall PPV for all diagnoses and both years was 95% (95% CI: 93-96). The PPV for the year 2010 was slightly higher 98% (95% CI: 95-99) than in the year 2002, 91% (95% CI: (87-94) which may be due to the increasing use of computed tomography (CT).

        "AbstractText": "Despite the fact that important advances in research on neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) have been made, consistent data about their pathogenetic mechanism are still lacking. Furthermore, different primary sites may recognize different pathogenetic mechanisms. This review analyzes the possible biological and molecular mechanisms that may lead to NEN onset and progression in different organs. Through extensive research of the literature, risk factors including hypercholesterolemia, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic atrophic gastritis are evaluated as potential pathogenetic mechanisms. Consistent evidence is available regarding sporadic gastric NENs and MEN1 related duodenopancreatic NENs precursor lesions, and genetic-epigenetic mutations may play a pivotal role in tumor development and bone metastases onset. In lung neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), diffuse proliferation of neuroendocrine cells on the bronchial wall (DIPNECH) has been proposed as a premalignant lesion, while in lung neuroendocrine carcinoma nicotine and smoke could be responsible for carcinogenic processes. Also, rare primary NENs such as thymic (T-NENs) and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) have been analyzed, finding different possible pathogenetic mechanisms. New technologies in genomics and epigenomics are bringing new light to the pathogenetic landscape of NENs, but further studies are needed to improve both prevention and treatment in these heterogeneous neoplasms.",

Effective interpersonal communication is a prominent predictor of patient-partner cancer management, improving the overall quality of life for the dyad by increasing their ability to cope with cancer. However, couples-based cancer interventions often do not consider cultural factors. Additionally, although Latinas have a high incidence of breast cancer, few studies focus on Latino couples and the influence of culture in cancer care interventions. This study focuses on understanding how Latino culture's norms and expectations influence how couples communicate and cope post-breast cancer diagnosis. This study conducted interviews and focus groups with a purposive sample of Spanish-speaking Latina breast cancer survivors (N\u2009=\u200921) and intimate partners (N\u2009=\u20095). In the focus group and interviews, participants were asked about the influence cancer had on their relationship, with specific questions focusing on communication within the dyad. The study team used CARV: Community-Engaged Adaptation with Rapid Analysis and Visualization framework to identify cultural considerations and recurring themes. The cross-cutting cultural considerations and themes found were: the negative influence of gendered and social norms on managing emotions and coping; the silent struggle with physical intimacy; and the inability to discuss the topic - or even say the word 'cancer.' Understanding the role of Latino culture in how couples cope with and communicate about cancer post-diagnosis is essential. This understanding will help strengthen the dyad by assisting with positive interpersonal support, which contributes to a better quality of life. These findings will also help providers assist dyads in navigating the cancer diagnosis and journey, helping to lessen the interpersonal stress and tensions that can occur after diagnosis.",

While guidance for infection prevention is provided by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), each institution may vary in antimicrobial prophylaxis prescribing practices. The discrepancy may be explained by medication intolerance, cost, and low incidence of mold infections in leukemia patients.

Then, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the current evidence towards serum vitamin D level in PsO. We searched in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, ScienceDirect and Science Information Database (SID) using the terms \"Vitamin D\" and \"Psoriasis\" including manuscripts in English, Italian and Persian. Duplications were excluded using EndNote software and records were screened by title, abstract and full-text. Quality assessment of studies was assessed using Newcastle Ottawa Checklist (NOS). Psoriasis odds ratio (OR) and mean serum vitamin D levels were calculated and displayed in Forest-plots. Heterogeneity indexes were evaluated using I2 and Q.

Here, we describe two cases of successful cetuximab treatment after Grade 2 reactions, in addition to risk factors and proposed premedication strategies for successful rechallenge. Two patients who experienced Grade 2 hypersensitivity reactions were both successfully rechallenged with increased premedications 1-2 weeks after initial infusions. The first patient was a 56-year-old male diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving cetuximab as part of a clinical trial. The second patient was a 73-year-old male diagnosed with head and neck cancer receiving cetuximab as part of standard of care concurrent with radiation. Each patient was rechallenged with an increased premedication strategy including dexamethasone, famotidine, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen in addition to reducing the infusion rate. Both patients either continued treatment or successfully completed therapy, without any additional infusion-related reactions. We aimed to review risk factors related to cetuximab infusion reactions and propose a premedication strategy for rechallenge postreaction. Known risk factors include male sex and the accumulation of cetuximab-specific IgE. These may be mitigated by the addition of increased premedication with dexamethasone and famotidine with concurrent reduced infusion rate.",

Among them, 8 cases were primary, and 2 cases were secondary. According to the Ann Arbor staging, 8 cases were stage \u2160-\u2161 E, and 2 cases were stage \u2162 E. Histopathological grading revealed 6 cases of grade 1-2 and 3 cases of grade 3A. One case showed grade 3B in the lacrimal sac area and grade 1-2 in the conjunctiva. The predominant subtype was follicular in 4 cases, diffuse in 3 cases, and mixed in 2 cases. One case had a mixed subtype involving the lacrimal sac and conjunctiva. All patients expressed positivity for leukocyte differentiation antigens (CD) 20, CD21, and CD23. Nine cases were positive for CD10, with 1 case showing partial CD10 positivity. All patients were positive for B-cell lymphoma protein 6 (BCL-6), and 9 cases were positive for BCL-2. Specific markers CyclinD1 and Multiple Myeloma Oncogene Protein 1 (MUM-1) were negatively expressed in all cases. The Ki-67 proliferation index ranged from 10% to 90%. Molecular detection was performed in 7 patients, with none showing positive EBER in situ hybridization. However, 5 cases exhibited BCL2/IgH gene fusion. Among 7 patients with follow-up data, the median follow-up time was 17 (6, 34) months. Four patients achieved complete remission, 2 had partial remission, and 1 patient died due to lung infection. Conclusions: OAFL is a tumor originating from follicular center B-cells, characterized by positive expression of BCL-2, CD10, and BCL-6. It can involve the lacrimal gland, extraconal muscles, lacrimal sac, and conjunctiva. Patients generally have a favorable prognosis. \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u773c\u9644\u5c5e\u5668\u6ee4\u6ce1\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u7624\uff08OAFL\uff09\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u56de\u987e\u6027\u75c5\u4f8b\u7cfb\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6536\u96c61990\u5e741\u6708\u81f32022\u5e745\u6708\u5728\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u773c\u79d1\u533b\u9662\u786e\u8bca\u768410\u4f8bOAFL\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u8d44\u6599\u548c\u75c5\u53f2\u3001\u53d1\u75c5\u90e8\u4f4d\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u53ca\u5206\u5b50\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u8d44\u6599\u3002\u5176\u4e2d7\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u7231\u6cfc\u65af\u5766-\u5df4\u5c14\u75c5\u6bd2\uff08EBV\uff09\u5c0f\u7f16\u7801RNA\uff08EBER\uff09\u53caB\u7ec6\u80de\u6dcb\u5df4\u7624\u86cb\u767d2\uff08BCL-2\uff09/\u514d\u75ab\u7403\u86cb\u767d\u91cd\u94fe\u57fa\u56e0\uff08IgH\uff09\u6613\u4f4d\u57fa\u56e0\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u9884\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u8bbf\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a 10\u4f8b\uff0810\u53ea\u773c\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u5747\u4e3a\u5355\u773c\u53d1\u75c5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7537\u60275\u4f8b\uff0c\u5973\u60275\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u4e3a58\uff0843\uff0c68\uff09\u5c81\u3002\u60a3\u8005\u4e34\u5e8a\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u773c\u7751\u80bf\u80c0\uff0c\u7ed3\u819c\u589e\u539a\u5448\u7c89\u7ea2\u8272\uff0c\u6cea\u817a\u533a\u3001\u7736\u5185\u6216\u6cea\u56ca\u533a\u7f13\u6162\u751f\u957f\u7684\u65e0\u75db\u6027\u80bf\u5757\u3002\u75c5\u53d8\u4f4d\u4e8e\u6cea\u817a4\u4f8b\uff0c\u7736\u5185\u808c\u9525\u59162\u4f8b\uff0c\u7ed3\u819c2\u4f8b\uff0c\u6cea\u56ca1\u4f8b\uff0c\u6cea\u56ca\u548c\u7ed3\u819c1\u4f8b\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u539f\u53d1\u60278\u4f8b\uff0c\u7ee7\u53d1\u60272\u4f8b\u3002Ann Arbor\u5206\u671f\u2160~\u2161E\u671f8\u4f8b\uff0c\u2162E\u671f2\u4f8b\u3002\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u7ea71~2\u7ea76\u4f8b\uff0c3A\u7ea73\u4f8b\uff1b\u53e6\u59161\u4f8b\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u6cea\u56ca\u533a3B\u7ea7\u548c\u7ed3\u819c1~2\u7ea7\u3002\u6ee4\u6ce1\u4e3a\u4e3b\u578b4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f25\u6f2b\u578b3\u4f8b\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u578b2\u4f8b\uff1b\u53e6\u59161\u4f8b\u6cea\u56ca\u533a\u548c\u7ed3\u819c\u5747\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u3002\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u80bf\u7624\u7ec6\u80de\u9633\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u767d\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u5316\u6297\u539f\u5206\u5316\u7fa4\uff08CD\uff0920\u3001CD21\u548cCD23\uff1b9\u4f8b\u9633\u6027\u8868\u8fbeCD10\uff0c1\u4f8b\u90e8\u5206\u7ec6\u80de\u9633\u6027\u8868\u8fbeCD10\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u9633\u6027\u8868\u8fbeB\u7ec6\u80de\u6dcb\u5df4\u7624\u86cb\u767d6\uff08BCL-6\uff09\uff1b9\u4f8b\u9633\u6027\u8868\u8fbeBCL-2\uff1b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5468\u671f\u86cb\u767d-D1\uff08CyclinD1\uff09\u53ca\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u9aa8\u9ad3\u7624\u764c\u57fa\u56e0\u86cb\u767d1\uff08MUM-1\uff09\u5747\u9634\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\uff1bki-67\u589e\u6b96\u6307\u6570\u4e3a10%~90%\u3002\u51717\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5b50\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cEBER\u539f\u4f4d\u6742\u4ea4\u672a\u89c1\u9633\u6027\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d5\u4f8b\u5b58\u5728BCL2\u4e0e/IgH\u57fa\u56e0\u878d\u5408\u3002\u83b7\u5f97\u968f\u8bbf\u76847\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u968f\u8bbf\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a17\uff086\uff0c34\uff09\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e34\u4f8b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e32\u4f8b\uff0c\u56e0\u80ba\u90e8\u611f\u67d3\u6b7b\u4ea11\u4f8b\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a OAFL\u662f\u6ee4\u6ce1\u4e2d\u5fc3B\u7ec6\u80de\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u80bf\u7624\uff0c\u80bf\u7624\u6027\u6ee4\u6ce1\u9633\u6027\u8868\u8fbeBCL-2\u3001CD10\u548cBCL-6\uff0c\u53ef\u7d2f\u53ca\u6cea\u817a\u3001\u7736\u5185\u3001\u6cea\u56ca\u53ca\u7ed3\u819c\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u666e\u904d\u8f83\u597d\u3002.",

        "AbstractText": "Collective cell migration, whereby cells adhere to form multi-cellular clusters that move as a single entity, play an important role in numerous biological processes, such as during development and cancer progression. Recent experimental work focused on migration of one-dimensional cellular clusters, confined to move along adhesive lanes, as a simple geometry in which to systematically study this complex system. One-dimensional migration also arises in the body when cells migrate along blood vessels, axonal projections and narrow cavities between tissues. We explore here the modes of one-dimensional migration of cellular clusters (\"trains\"), by implementing cell-cell interactions in a model of cell migration that contains a mechanism for spontaneous cell polarization. We go beyond simple phenomenological models of the cells as self-propelled particles, by having the internal polarization of each cell depend on its interactions with the neighboring cells, that directly affect the actin polymerization activity at the cell's leading edges. Both Contact Inhibition of Locomotion (CIL) and Cryptic Lamellipodia (CL) interactions between neighboring cells are introduced. We find that this model predicts multiple motility modes of the cell trains, that can have several different speeds for the same polarization pattern. Comparing to experimental data we find that MDCK cells are poised along the transition region where CIL and CL roughly balance each other, where collective migration speed is most sensitive to the values of the cell-cell interaction strength.",

        "AbstractText": "Using Mendelian Randomization (MR) and large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data, this study aimed to investigate the potential causative relationship between testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and the onset of several cancers, including pathway enrichment analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cancer allowed for a comprehensive bioinformatics approach, which offered a deeper biological understanding of these relationships. The results indicated that increased testosterone levels in women were associated with a higher risk of breast and cervical cancers but a lower risk of ovarian cancer. Conversely, increased testosterone was linked to lower stomach cancer risk for men, whereas high SHBG levels were related to decreased risks of breast and prostate cancers. The corresponding genes of the identified SNPs, as revealed by pathway enrichment analysis, were involved in significant metabolic and proliferative pathways. These findings emphasize the need for further research into the biological mechanisms behind these associations, paving the way for potential targeted interventions in preventing and treating these cancers.",

        "AbstractText": "Encapsulating chemotherapeutic drugs like doxorubicin (DOX) inside lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can overcome their acute, systematic toxicity. However, a precise drug release at the tumor microenvironment for improving the maximum tolerated dose and reducing side effects has yet to be well-established by implementing a safe stimuli-responsive strategy. This study proposes an integrated nanoscale perforation to trigger DOX release from hybrid plasmonic multilamellar LNPs composed of 5\u00a0nm gold (Au) NPs clustered at the internal lamellae interfaces. To promote site-specific DOX release, a single pulse irradiation strategy is developed by taking advantage of the resonant interaction between nanosecond pulsed laser radiation (527\u00a0nm) and the plasmon mode of the hybrid nanocarriers. This approach enlarges the amount of DOX in the target cells up to 11-fold compared to conventional DOX-loaded LNPs, leading to significant cancer cell death. The simulation of the pulsed laser interactions of the hybrid nanocarriers suggests a release mechanism mediated by either explosive vaporization of thin water layers adjacent to AuNP clusters or thermo-mechanical decomposition of overheated lipid layers. This simulation indicates an intact DOX integrity following irradiation since the temperature distribution is highly localized around AuNP clusters and highlights a controlled light-triggered drug delivery system.",

        "AbstractText": "Glioblastomas have highly infiltrative growth patterns that contribute to recurrence and poor survival. Despite infiltration being a critical therapeutic target, no clinically useful therapies exist which counter glioblastoma invasion. Here, we report that inhibition of Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad 3 related kinase (ATR) reduces invasion of glioblastoma cells through dysregulation of cytoskeletal networks and subsequent integrin trafficking. Glioblastoma motility and invasion were assessed in vitro and in vivo in response to ATR inhibition (ATRi) and ATR over-expression using timelapse microscopy, two orthotopic glioblastoma models and intravital imaging. Disruption to cytoskeleton networks and endocytic processing were investigated via high throughput, super resolution imaging and intravital imaging. High ATR expression was associated with significantly poorer survival in clinical datasets whilst histological, protein expression and spatial transcriptomics using glioblastoma tumour specimens revealed higher ATR expression at infiltrative margins. Pharmacological inhibition with two different compounds and RNAi targeting of ATR opposed invasion of glioblastoma, whereas overexpression of ATR drove migration. Subsequent investigation revealed that cytoskeletal dysregulation reduced macropinocytotic internalisation of integrins at growth cone-like structures, resulting in a tumour microtube retraction defect. The biological relevance and translational potential of these findings was confirmed using two orthotopic in vivo models of glioblastoma and intravital imaging. We demonstrate a novel role for ATR in determining invasion in glioblastoma cells and propose that pharmacological targeting of ATR could have far reaching clinical benefits beyond radiosensitisation.",

        "AbstractText": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play fundamental roles in cancer development; however, the underlying mechanisms for a large proportion of lncRNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have not been elucidated. The expression of colon cancer associated transcript-1 (CCAT1) in PDAC specimens and cell lines was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The function of CCAT1 was examined in vitro and in vivo. The interactions among CCAT1, miR-24-3p, and c-Myc were determined by a bioinformatics analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), dual-luciferase reporter assay, and rescue experiments. CCAT1 was significantly increased in PDAC, positively correlated with PDAC progression, and predicted a worse prognosis. Furthermore, CCAT1 enhanced ATP production to facilitate PDAC cell proliferation, colony formation, and motility in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. CCAT1 may serve as a miR-24-3p sponge, thereby counteracting its repression by c-Myc expression. Reciprocally, c-Myc may act as a transcription factor to alter CCAT1 expression by directly targeting its promoter region, thus forming a positive feedback loop with CCAT1. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a positive feedback loop of CCAT1/miR-24-3p/c-Myc is involved in PDAC development, which may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for PDAC.",

The aim of this study was to assess exposure to BTEX and their carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks in shoe-industry-related workplaces. This study was carried out at different shoe manufactures, small shoe workshop units, shoe markets, and shoe stores in Tabriz, Iran in 2021. Personal inhalation exposure to BTEX was measured using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 1501 method. Carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks due to inhalation exposure to BTEX were estimated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) method based on Mont Carlo simulation. Results showed that the concentrations of benzene and toluene were higher than the threshold limit value (TLV) in both gluing and non-gluing units of shoe manufactures. The total carcinogenic risk (TCR) due to exposure to benzene and ethyl benzene was considerable in all shoe industry-related workplaces. Also, the hazard index (HI) as a non-carcinogenic index was higher than standard levels in all shoe industry-related workplaces. Therefore, shoe industry-related workers are at cancer and non-cancer risks due to exposure to BTEX.

Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA to compare the two groups, and the correlation between markers and clinical parameters. Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine the optimal cutoff values and evaluate the diagnostic impact of these markers. Significant differences in the levels of sCD163, FoxP3, and IGF-1 were observed between LSCC patients and the control group, with respective p-values of 0.01, 0.022, <0.0001. The determined cutoff values for sCD163, FoxP3, IGF-1 concentrations were 314.55 ng/mL, 1.69 ng/mL, and 1.69 ng/mL, respectively. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57-0.76), 0.70 (95% CI: 0.61-0.80), 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.92), respectively. Furthermore, it was found that IGF-1 concentrations exceeding 125.20\u2009ng/mL were positively correlated with lymph node metastasis.

An informatics-based approach was used to retrospectively evaluate concordance between SFLC and the orthogonal Sebia HYDRASYS immunofixation assay results in a large clinical data set consecutively reported between 2010 and 2020. Among patients with monoclonal-negative results by both SFLC and Sebia HYDRASYS immunofixation assays, 25% (1226/5057) had \u03ba/\u03bb ratios (KLRs) outside the manufacturer-defined and International Myeloma Working Group-cited normal reference interval of 0.26 to 1.65. These results were consistent over the study period and were not affected by sex, age, impaired kidney function, or assay antisera lot variation. Assay drift, in addition to other potential factors, affected the KLR distribution. Using International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, kidney function data, and the central 95% of KLR values generated on the Optilite platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific), we derived a new reference interval of 0.67 to 2.13, reducing the KLR false-positive rate to 8%.

        "AbstractText": "Epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3) is an N-glycosylated tetraspanin with a putative trafficking function. It is highly expressed in isocitrate dehydrogenase-wild-type glioblastoma (IDH-wt GBM), and its high expression correlates with poor survival. However, the exact trafficking role of EMP3 and how it promotes oncogenic signaling in GBM remain unclear. Here, we show that EMP3 promotes EGFR/CDK2 signaling by regulating the trafficking and enhancing the stability of EGFR. BioID2-based proximity labeling revealed that EMP3 interacts with endocytic proteins involved in the vesicular transport of EGFR. EMP3 knockout (KO) enhances epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced shuttling of EGFR into RAB7\u2009+\u2009late endosomes, thereby promoting EGFR degradation. Increased EGFR degradation is rescued by the RAB7 negative regulator and novel EMP3 interactor TBC1D5. Phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic analyses further showed that EMP3 KO converges into the inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2 and the repression of EGFR-dependent and cell cycle transcriptional programs. Phenotypically, EMP3 KO cells exhibit reduced proliferation rates, blunted mitogenic response to EGF, and increased sensitivity to the pan-kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib. Furthermore, EGFR-dependent patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells display a transcriptomic signature consistent with reduced CDK2 activity, as well as increased susceptibility to CDK2 inhibition upon EMP3 knockdown. Lastly, using TCGA data, we showed that GBM tumors with high EMP3 expression have increased total and phosphorylated EGFR levels. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a novel EMP3-dependent mechanism by which EGFR/CDK2 activity is sustained in GBM. Consequently, EMP3's stabilizing effect provides an additional layer of tumor cell resistance against targeted kinase inhibition.",

However, the relationship between TMEM79 expression in HCC and prognosis, its role and mechanism of action, and its relationship with SMG5 have not been studied. This article focuses on not only the prognostic role of TMEM79 and its biological significance, including immuno-infiltration, tumor mutations and drug sensitivity, but also the interaction with SMG5 in HCC. Differential expression analysis and the multiCox proportional hazards regression analyses of TMEM79 and SMG5 were performed by multiple databases. Then, use IHC to verify our results. Subsequently, we used R software to analyze the clinical phenotype of both: analysis of clinicopathological features, enrichment analysis, analysis of immune infiltration, analysis of immune checkpoints, analysis of drug sensitivity, and immunotherapy. Both the database studies and the results of our research group showed that TMEM79 and SMG5 were differentially expressed in HCC and normal tissues. Validation of immunohistochemistry showed that differential expression of TMEM79 and SMG5, which influenced the prognosis of patients with HCC, could be an independent prognostic factor. Results of the TCGA database study showed that TMEM79 and SMG5 were correlated with immune infiltration, immune checkpoints, drug sensitivity, and immunotherapy. We typed TMEM79-related molecules in HCC according to R software. Two types of TMEM79 correlated with clinical features, survival of patients with HCC, and immune infiltration. TMEM79 are highly expressed in HCC and play an important role in the prognosis of patients with HCC. TMEM79 and SMG5 are positively correlated and may both associated with immune infiltration, and closely linked to immune checkpoints, drug sensitivity, and immunotherapy in HCC.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma via no end-repair enzymatic methylation sequencing of cell-free DNA and pre-trained neural network.",
        "AbstractText": "Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is important in order to improve patient prognosis and survival rate. Methylation sequencing combined with neural networks to identify cell-free DNA (cfDNA) carrying aberrant methylation offers an appealing and non-invasive approach for HCC detection. However, some limitations exist in traditional methylation detection technologies and models, which may impede their performance in the read-level detection of HCC. We developed a low DNA damage and high-fidelity methylation detection method called No End-repair Enzymatic Methyl-seq (NEEM-seq). We further developed a read-level neural detection model called DeepTrace that can better identify HCC-derived sequencing reads through a pre-trained and fine-tuned neural network. After pre-training on 11 million reads from NEEM-seq, DeepTrace was fine-tuned using 1.2 million HCC-derived reads from tumor tissue DNA after noise reduction, and 2.7 million non-tumor reads from non-tumor cfDNA. We validated the model using data from 130 individuals with cfDNA whole-genome NEEM-seq at around 1.6X depth. NEEM-seq overcomes the drawbacks of traditional enzymatic methylation sequencing methods by avoiding the introduction of unmethylation errors in cfDNA. DeepTrace outperformed other models in identifying HCC-derived reads and detecting HCC individuals. Based on the whole-genome NEEM-seq data of cfDNA, our model showed high accuracy of 96.2%, sensitivity of 93.6%, and specificity of 98.5% in the validation cohort consisting of 62 HCC patients, 48 liver disease patients, and 20 healthy individuals. In the early stage of HCC (BCLC 0/A and TNM I), the sensitivity of DeepTrace was 89.6 and 89.5% respectively, outperforming Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) which showed much lower sensitivity in both BCLC 0/A (50.5%) and TNM I (44.7%). By combining high-fidelity methylation data from NEEM-seq with the DeepTrace model, our method has great potential for HCC early detection with high sensitivity and specificity, making it potentially suitable for clinical applications.

However, adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy imaging revealed foveal cone loss in both eyes, but to a lesser extent in the right eye. Inner retinal changes were not observed in either eye. The area of cone loss was similar in size to a single newsprint letter when projected onto the retina, matching the patient's description of a scotoma in the left eye. Given the isolated loss of foveal cone photoreceptors with the absence of previously reported inner retinal and vascular changes, our results may indicate the earliest retinal changes associated with tamoxifen retinopathy.",

        "AbstractText": "Prostate cancer (PCA) is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with limited treatment options in the advanced stages. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of PCA results in lower sensitivity to immunotherapy. Although molecular subtyping is expected to offer important clues for precision treatment of PCA, there is currently a shortage of dependable and effective molecular typing methods available for clinical practice. Therefore, we aim to propose a novel stemness-based classification approach to guide personalized clinical treatments, including immunotherapy. An integrative multi-omics analysis of PCA was performed to evaluate stemness-level heterogeneities. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to classify PCAs based on stemness signature genes. To make stemness-based patient classification more clinically applicable, a stemness subtype predictor was jointly developed by using four PCA datasets and 76 machine learning algorithms. We identified stemness signatures of PCA comprising 18 signaling pathways, by which we classified PCA samples into three stemness subtypes via unsupervised hierarchical clustering: low stemness (LS), medium stemness (MS), and high stemness (HS) subtypes. HS patients are sensitive to androgen deprivation therapy, taxanes, and immunotherapy and have the highest stemness, malignancy, tumor mutation load (TMB) levels, worst prognosis, and immunosuppression. LS patients are sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy but resistant to immunotherapy and have the lowest stemness, malignancy, and TMB levels, best prognosis, and the highest immune infiltration. MS patients represent an intermediate status of stemness, malignancy, and TMB levels with a moderate prognosis. We further demonstrated that these three stemness subtypes are conserved across pan-tumor. Additionally, the 9-gene stemness subtype predictor we developed has a comparable capability to 18 signaling pathways to make tumor diagnosis and to predict tumor recurrence, metastasis, progression, prognosis, and efficacy of different treatments. The three stemness subtypes we identified have the potential to be a powerful tool for clinical tumor molecular classification in PCA and pan-cancer, and to guide the selection of immunotherapy or other sensitive treatments for tumor patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Ever since their discovery, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been extensively differentiated into a large variety of cell types. However, a limited amount of work has been dedicated to differentiating iPSCs into osteoclasts. While several differentiation protocols have been published, it remains unclear which protocols or differentiation methods are preferable regarding the differentiation of osteoclasts. In this study, we compared the osteoclastogenesis capacity of a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived iPSC line to a fibroblast-derived iPSC line in conjunction with either embryoid body-based or monolayer-based differentiation strategies. Both cell lines and differentiation protocols were investigated regarding their ability to generate osteoclasts and their inherent robustness and ease of use. The ability of both cell lines to remain undifferentiated while propagating using a feeder-free system was assessed using alkaline phosphatase staining. This was followed by evaluating mesodermal differentiation and the characterization of hematopoietic progenitor cells using flow cytometry. Finally, osteoclast yield and functionality based on resorptive activity, Cathepsin K and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression were assessed. The results were validated using qRT-PCR throughout the differentiation stages. Embryoid body-based differentiation yielded CD45+, CD14+, CD11b+ subpopulations which in turn differentiated into osteoclasts which demonstrated TRAP positivity, Cathepsin K expression and mineral resorptive capabilities. This was regardless of which iPSC line was used. Monolayer-based differentiation yielded lower quantities of hematopoietic cells that were mostly CD34+ and did not subsequently differentiate into osteoclasts. The outcome of this study demonstrates the successful differentiation of osteoclasts from iPSCs in conjunction with the embryoid-based differentiation method, while the monolayer-based method did not yield osteoclasts. No differences were observed regarding osteoclast differentiation between the PBMC and fibroblast-derived iPSC lines.",

To evaluate the similarity between synthetic CT (sCT) and real CT (rCT) comprehensively, we comprehensively evaluated IQMs and radiomic features for the first time. This study enrolled 127 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who underwent CT and MRI scans. Supervised-learning (Unet) and unsupervised-learning (CycleGAN) methods were applied to build MRI-to-CT synthesis models. The regions of interest (ROIs) included nasopharynx gross tumor volume (GTVnx), brainstem, parotid glands, and temporal lobes. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and structural similarity (SSIM) were used to evaluate image quality. Additionally, 837 radiomic features were extracted for each ROI, and the correlation was evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). The MAE, RMSE, SSIM, and PSNR of the body were 91.99, 187.12, 0.97, and 51.15 for Unet and 108.30, 211.63, 0.96, and 49.84 for CycleGAN. For the metrics, Unet was superior to CycleGAN (P\u2009<\u20090.05). For the radiomic features, the percentage of four levels (i.e., excellent, good, moderate, and poor, respectively) were as follows: GTVnx, 8.5%, 14.6%, 26.5%, and 50.4% for Unet and 12.3%, 25%, 38.4%, and 24.4% for CycleGAN; other ROIs, 5.44%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.27%, 5.56%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.92%, 21.38%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.91%, and 67.58%\u2009\u00b1\u20098.96% for Unet and 5.16%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.69%, 3.5%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.52%, 12.68%\u2009\u00b1\u20097.51%, and 78.62%\u2009\u00b1\u20098.57% for CycleGAN.

First, a rapid review of select high-income countries was conducted, followed by expert consultations and an in-depth review of three countries: Australia, England and Republic of Korea to understand reimbursement mechanisms of high-cost medicines. In Thailand, current pathways for reimbursing high-cost medicines reviewed, the potential opportunity cost estimated, and stakeholder consultations were conducted to identify context specific considerations. High-income countries reviewed have implemented a variety of pathways and mechanisms for reimbursing high-cost medicines under specific eligibility criteria, listing processes, varying cost-effectiveness thresholds and special funding arrangements. In Thailand, high-cost medicines that do not offer good value-for-money are excluded from the reimbursement process. A framework for reimbursing high-cost medicines that are not cost-effective at the current willingness-to-pay threshold was proposed for Thailand. Under this framework, specific criteria are proposed to determine their eligibility for reimbursement such life-saving nature, treatment of conditions with no alternative treatment options, and affordability. High-cost medicines may become eligible for reimbursement through alternative mechanisms based on specific criteria which depend on each context. The application of HTA methods and processes is important in guiding these decisions to support sustainable access to affordable healthcare in pursuit of Universal Health Coverage (UHC).",

At present, the most widely used ICIs in clinical immunotherapy for a variety of solid tumors are monoclonal antibodies against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and their ligand PD-L1. However, tumor patients may induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs) while performing immunotherapy, and irAE is an obstacle to the prospect of ICI treatment. IrAE is a non-specific disease caused by immune system imbalance, which can occur in many tissues and organs. For example, skin, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine system and lung. Although the exact mechanism is not completely clear, related studies have shown that irAE may develop through many ways. Such as excessive activation of autoreactive T cells, excessive release of inflammatory cytokines, elevated levels of autoantibodies, and common antigens between tumors and normal tissues. Considering that the occurrence of severe IrAE not only causes irreversible damage to the patient's body, but also terminates immunotherapy due to immune intolerance. Therefore, accurate identification and screening of sensitive markers of irAE are the main beneficiaries of ICI treatment. Additionally, irAEs usually require specific management, the most common of which are steroids and immunomodulatory therapies. This review aims to summarize the current biomarkers for predicting irAE in gastric cancer and their possible mechanisms.",

However, these two tasks present continuous difficulties due to the nonuniform intensity distributions, ambiguous boundaries, and variable shapes of brain metastasis (BM) in MR images.The existing approaches for tackling these challenges mainly rely on single-task algorithms, which overlook the interdependence between these two tasks. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a multi-task deep learning model that simultaneously enables GTV segmentation and EGFR subtype classification. Specifically, a multi-scale self-attention encoder that consists of a convolutional self-attention module is designed to extract the shared spatial and global information for a GTV segmentation decoder and an EGFR genotype classifier. Then, a hybrid CNN-Transformer classifier consisting of a convolutional block and a Transformer block is designed to combine the global and local information. Furthermore, the task correlation and heterogeneity issues are solved with a multi-task loss function, aiming to balance the above two tasks by incorporating segmentation and classification loss functions with learnable weights. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves excellent performance, surpassing that of single-task learning approaches. Our proposed model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.89 for GTV segmentation and an EGFR genotyping accuracy of 0.88 on an internal testing set, and attains an accuracy of 0.81 in the EGFR genotype prediction task and an average Dice score of 0.85 in the GTV segmentation task on the external testing set. This shows that our proposed method has outstanding performance and generalization. With the introduction of an efficient feature extraction module, a hybrid CNN-Transformer classifier, and a multi-task loss function, the proposed multi-task deep learning network significantly enhances the performance achieved in both GTV segmentation and EGFR genotyping tasks. Thus, the model can serve as a noninvasive tool for facilitating clinical treatment.",

It is well known that hypoxia plays an important role in promoting radioresistance in tumor microenvironment, yet our understanding of the effect of small extracellular vesicles miRNA on cervical cancer radiosensitivity in hypoxic environment is still limited. Small extracellular vesicles extracted from hypoxic and normoxic cultured cervical cancer cells were evaluated for their effects on radioresistance. miR-152-3p was found to be a potential effector in hypoxia-derived extracellular vesicles by searching the GEO database. Its downstream substrate was confirmed by double luciferase report, which was KLF15. The role of miR-152-3p and KLF15 in regulating cervical cancer radioresistance was detected by cell activity assays. The findings were confirmed in vivo by animal models. The expression of miR-152-3p was quantified by qRT-PCR and its prognostic significance was evaluated. Hypoxic environment promoted the secretion of small extracellular vesicles, and reduced the apoptosis and DNA damage caused by radiation, accompanied by increased expression of small extracellular vesicles miR-152-3p from hypoxic cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, small extracellular vesicles miR-152-3p promoted Hela xenograft growth and reduced the radiosensitivity vivo. Mechanism studies revealed that KLF15 protein was the downstream target of miR-152-3p in regulating radioresistance.

By subdivision using the DM distance of 30\u00a0mm, more segmented prognostic stratifications were possible (P\u2009<\u20090.001). A DM of less than 30\u00a0mm could be a surrogate marker of poor RFS, especially increasing nodal recurrence. More intensive treatment strategies, including lymphadenectomy and chemotherapy, are needed for patients with this condition.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Effect of Oroxylum indicum on hepatocellular carcinoma via the P53 and VEGF pathways based on microfluidic chips.",
        "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), abbreviated as liver cancer, is one of the most common cancers in clinics. HCC has a wider spread and higher incidence due to its high malignancy and metastasis. In HCC, effective strategies to block cancer cell migration, invasion, and neovascularization need to be further studied. Consumption of flavonoid-rich Oroxylum indicum (OI) has been associated with multiple beneficial effects, including anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, but the potential effects on HCC have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we aimed to reveal the effect of OI on HCC and its potential mechanism through microfluidic technology. We designed microfluidic chips for cell migration, invasion, and neovascularization to evaluate the effect of OI on HepG2 cells. To further explore the mechanism of its anti-liver cancer action, the relevant signaling pathways were studied by microfluidic chips, RT\u2012qPCR and immunofluorescence techniques. Compared to the control group, cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis were significantly reduced in each administration group. According to the P53 and VEGF pathways predicted by network pharmacology, RT\u2012qPCR and immunofluorescence staining experiments were conducted. The results showed that OI upregulated the expression of Bax, P53 and Caspase-3 and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and MDM2. It has been speculated that OI may directly or indirectly induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells by regulating apoptosis-related genes. OI blocks the VEGF signaling pathway by downregulating the expression levels of VEGF, HIF-1\u03b1 and EGFR and inhibits the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells and the formation of new blood vessels. Our findings suggest that OI may inhibit the migration, invasion, and neovascularization of HepG2 cells, and its regulatory mechanism may be related to the regulation of the P53 and VEGF pathways.",

The present study aimed to develop a model to predict the growth rate of SSNs. A total of 273 growing SSNs with clinical information and 857 computed tomography (CT) scans were retrospectively analyzed. The images were randomly divided into training and validation sets. All images were categorized into fast-growth (volume doubling time (VDT)\u2009\u2264\u2009400\u00a0days) and slow-growth (VDT\u2009>\u2009400\u00a0days) groups. Models for predicting the growth rate of SSNs were developed using radiomics and clinical features. The models' performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) values for the receiver operating characteristic curve. The fast- and slow-growth groups included 108 and 749 scans, respectively, and 10 radiomics features and three radiographic features (nodule density, presence of spiculation, and presence of vascular changes) were selected to predict the growth rate of SSNs. The nomogram integrating radiomics and radiographic features (AUC\u2009=\u20090.928 and AUC\u2009=\u20090.905, respectively) performed better than the radiographic (AUC\u2009=\u20090.668 and AUC\u2009=\u20090.689, respectively) and radiomics (AUC\u2009=\u20090.888 and AUC\u2009=\u20090.816, respectively) models alone in both the training and validation sets. The nomogram model developed by combining radiomics with radiographic features can predict the growth rate of SSNs more accurately than traditional radiographic models. It can also optimize clinical treatment decisions for patients with SSNs and improve their long-term management.",

Type D personality has been related to supportive care needs in the general population. However, its association with supportive care needs in elderly breast cancer patients has not been prospectively explored. This study aimed to address this gap. The aim was to understand the impact of Type D personality on the supportive care needs of elderly breast cancer patients at diagnosis, 2 weeks postoperatively, 3 months postoperatively, and 6 months postoperatively and to analyse the impact of Type D personality on the changing trajectory of supportive care needs after controlling for confounding factors such as demographics, symptom distress and social support. A total of 122 elderly patients (\u2265\u200965\u00a0years) with breast cancer in Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai, China, were included from September 2021 until August 2022. Supportive care needs were measured by the Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form and tracked at diagnosis, 2 weeks postoperatively, 3 months postoperatively, and 6 months postoperatively. To investigate changes in the supportive care needs of elderly breast cancer patients and the effect of Type D personality on these needs, a linear mixed model was applied. A total of 122 elderly patients participated. There was an overall decreasing trend in supportive care needs, with Type D personality patients having significantly higher levels of supportive care needs than the non-Type D personality patients at all stages. Through linear mixed models, it was found that the Type D personality group had a lower overall downward trend than the non-Type D personality group, with need levels remaining consistently higher. This difference persisted after controlling for demographic information, symptom burden, social support. Elderly breast cancer patients with Type D personality had higher levels of supportive care needs and a slower rate of decline that was maintained over a longer period than those with non-Type D personality.",

A total of 138 patients with recurrent RLS were finally recruited in the study. The analysis of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was performed by Kaplan\u2012Meier analysis. To identify independent prognostic factors, all significant variables on univariate Cox regression analysis (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) were subjected to multivariate Cox regression analysis. The corresponding nomogram model was further built to predict the survival status of patients. Among patients, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 70.7%, 35.9% and 30.9%, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year RFS rates of the 55 patients who underwent R0 resection were 76.1%, 50.8% and 34.4%, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that resection method, tumor size, status of pathological differentiation, pathological subtypes and recurrence pattern were independent risk factors for OS or RFS. Patients with distant recurrence (DR) pattern usually had multifocal tumors (90.5% vs. 74.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.05); they were prone to experience changes of pathological differentiation (69.9% vs. 33.3%, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and had a better prognosis than those with local recurrence (LR) pattern. R0 resection and combined organ resection favored the survival of patients with DR pattern in some cases. Patients with DR pattern had better prognosis, and they may benefit more from aggressive combined resection than those with LR pattern. Classifying the recurrence patterns of RLS provides guidance for individualized clinical management of recurrent RLS.",

        "AbstractText": "DCLRE1B is a 5'-to-3' exonuclease, which is involved in repairing ICL-related DNA damage. DCLRE1B has been reported to cause poor prognosis in a variety of cancers. Nonetheless, there is no research on DCLRE1B's biological role in pan-cancer datasets. Thus, ascertaining the processes via which DCLRE1B modulates tumorigenesis was the goal of the extensive bioinformatics investigation of pan-cancer datasets in the present research. In our research, employing internet websites and databases including TIMER, GEPIA, TISIDB, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, SangerBox, cBioPortal, and LinkedOmics, DCLRE1B-related data in numerous tumors were extracted. To ascertain the association among DCLRE1B expression, prognosis, genetic changes, and tumor immunity, the pan-cancer datasets were examined. The DCLRE1B's biological roles in pancreatic cancer cells were ascertained by employing wound healing, in vitro CCK-8, and MeRIP-qPCR assays. According to the pan-cancer analysis, in numerous solid tumors, DCLRE1B upregulation was observed. Expression of DCLRE1B was found to be substantially related to the cancer patients' prognoses. Similarly, expression of DCLRE1B exhibited substantial association with immune cells in several cancer types. DCLRE1B expression correlated with immune checkpoint (ICP) gene expression and impacted immunotherapy sensitivity. According to in vitro trials, DCLRE1B promoted PC cells' proliferation and migration capacities. Also, according to GSEA enrichment analysis, DCLRE1B might participate in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which was confirmed by western blotting. In addition, we also found that the downregulation of DCLRE1B may be regulated by METTL3-mediated m6A modification. In human cancer, the overexpression of DCLRE1B was generally observed, which aided cancer onset and advancement via a variety of processes comprising control of the immune cells' tumor infiltration. According to this study's findings, in a few malignant tumors, DCLRE1B is a candidate immunotherapeutic and prognostic biomarker.",

However, whether MEHP exposure is associated with mortality and other adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients remains unknown. This study prospectively enrolled 217 patients on maintenance hemodialysis from June 30, 2021, to August 16, 2022. Baseline serum MEHP, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and indoxyl sulfate (IS) concentrations were measured. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality or composite adverse outcomes, including all-cause death plus hospitalization due to cardiovascular disease, heart failure, stroke, infection, or cancer. Serum MEHP concentrations were positively associated with DEHP but not indoxyl sulfate concentrations in hemodialysis patients. Additionally, serum MEHP concentrations were significantly and independently associated with all-cause mortality and composite adverse outcomes (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs], 1.04 and 1.03 per ng/mL, 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 1.01-1.07 and 1.00-1.05; p\u2009=\u20090.016 and 0.015, respectively).

Exposure to ionizing radiation can become a public health problem worldwide, since it is related to the development of different cancers in humans. The present study aimed to survey research on the radioactive content in different types of mineral phosphate fertilizers used around the world through a comprehensive review of the Scopus and Web of Science databases. About 80 scientific articles fit the purpose of this review. The concentration activity values found varied widely from one country to another, and there is no specific legislation that determines the maximum allowed limits of radioisotopes in these agricultural inputs.

Over one year, Candida isolates were collected from samples of patients with hematological and solid organ tumors in a single center.\u00a0Species of Candida were identified by chromagar and multiplex sn-PCR using specific primers for Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, and the Candida parapsilosis complex. Most Candida infection episodes are caused by NAC species (70.5% of 105 isolates). Rare species (14 isolates) accounted for 13.3% of isolates and were not identified by sn-PCR using the five most common Candida species primers. More than half of these rare species caused candidemia in cancer patients (57.1%; p\u2009=\u20090.011). The risk factor for candidiasis was recent surgeries (p\u2009=\u20090.020) in adults and chemotherapy in pediatric patients (p\u2009=\u20090.006). Prolonged hospitalization and genitourinary tract cancer were significantly associated with invasive infections (p\u2009=\u20090.005 and 0.049, respectively). Recent surgery was a significant risk factor associated with C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata infections (P\u2009=\u20090.038 and 0.003, respectively), while C. tropicalis was significantly more common in patients with hematological malignancies (P\u2009=\u20090.012).

The overall survey response rate was 38% (221/582) with a slight male predominance (63%). Forty-six percent of respondents completed their fellowship after 2019. Factors influencing fellowship program selection include breadth of cancer case exposure (82%), mentor influence (66%), and research opportunities (38%). Overall, graduates reported preparedness for practice; however, some reported unpreparedness in research (18%) and in specific clinical areas: thoracic (43%), hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) (15%), and hepato-pancreato-biliary (15%) surgery. Regarding technical preparedness, 70% reported being \"very prepared\". Respondents indicated lack of preparedness in robotic (63%) and laparoscopic (33%) surgery approaches. Suggestions for training improvement included increased autonomy and case volumes, program development, and research infrastructure. Current practice patterns by graduates demonstrated discrepancies between ideal contracts and actual practice breakdowns, particularly related to the practice of general surgery.

        "AbstractText": "Approximately 20% of breast cancers express HER2-positive receptors in the USA. HER2 receptor immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with equivocal (2+) results commonly undergoes fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) for further classification. Current guidelines do not recommend routine FISH testing in IHC-negative (0 or 1+) cases. This study investigates an institution that performs both IHC and FISH testing on all cases to identify the true HER2-positive rate. A retrospective chart review from 2015 to 2021 was conducted at an institution where both HER2 IHC and FISH testing were performed at the time of diagnosis for all invasive breast cancers. The rate of true HER2-positive patients was determined, and patient and tumor characteristics were further explored. A total of 1835 invasive breast cancer cases were primarily treated at this institution. A total of 289 cases were HER2 positive on IHC and FISH testing (15.7%). An additional 38 cases were identified as HER2 negative on IHC, but reclassified as HER2 positive on reflex FISH testing. Total HER2 positive cases increased from 289 (15.7%) to 327 cases (17.8%) with reflex FISH testing. The additional HER2-positive cases after completing FISH testing on IHC-negative tumors suggests there may be a role for routine FISH testing in addition to standard IHC staining to determine HER2 status for breast cancer.

A total of 2534 patients undergoing minimally invasive major hepatectomies (MIMH) for primary malignancies across 58 centers worldwide were retrospectively reviewed. Propensity score (PSM) and coarsened exact matching (CEM) were used to compare patients with and without cirrhosis. A total of 1353 patients (53%) had no cirrhosis, 1065 (42%) had Child-Pugh A and 116 (4%) had Child-Pugh B cirrhosis. Matched comparison between non-cirrhotics vs Child-Pugh A cirrhosis demonstrated comparable blood loss.

        "AbstractText": "Phase III evidence showed that next-generation imaging (NGI), such as prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA PET/CT), provides higher diagnostic accuracy than bone scan and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (conventional imaging, CI) in the primary staging of intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients. However, due to the lack of outcome data, the introduction of NGI in routine clinical practice is still debated. Analysing the oncological outcome of patients upstaged by NGI (though managed according to CI) might shed light on this issue, supporting the design of randomised trials comparing the effects of treatments delivered based on NGI vs. CI. We prospectively enrolled a cohort of 100 biopsy-proven intermediate-to-high-risk PCa patients staged with CI and PSMA PET/CT (though managed according to the CI stage), to assess the frequency of the stage migration phenomenon. Stage migration was then assessed as biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) predictor. Three patients were lost at follow-up after imaging.\u00a0PSMA PET/CT upstaged 26.8% of patients compared to CI, while it downstaged 6.1% of patients. Notably, 50% of patients excluded from surgery due to the presence of bone metastases at CI would have been treated with radical-intent approaches if PSMA PET/CT had guided the treatment choice. After a median follow-up of 6\u00a0months of surgically treated patients, 22/83 (26.5%) had biochemical recurrence (BCR). PSMA PET/CT-driven upstaging determined a significant risk increase for BCR (HR:3.41, 95%CI:1.21-9.56, p\u2009=\u20090.019). Including stage migration in a univariable and multivariable model identified PSMA PET/CT-upstaging as an independent predictor of bRFS. In conclusion, implementing NGI for staging purposes improves the prediction of bRFS. Although phase III evidence is still needed, this advancement suggests that NGI may better identify patients who would benefit from local treatments than those who may achieve better oncological outcomes through systemic treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "To be functional, some RNAs require a processing step involving splicing events. Each splicing event necessitates an RNA ligation step. RNA ligation is a process that can be achieved with various intermediaries such as self-catalysing RNAs, 5'-3' and 3'-5' RNA ligases. While several types of RNA ligation mechanisms occur in human, RtcB is the only 3'-5' RNA ligase identified in human cells to date. RtcB RNA ligation activity is well known to be essential for the splicing of XBP1, an essential transcription factor of the unfolded protein response; as well as for the maturation of specific intron-containing tRNAs. As such, RtcB is a core factor in protein synthesis and homeostasis. Taking advantage of the high homology between RtcB orthologues in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes, this review will provide an introduction to the structure of RtcB and the mechanism of 3'-5' RNA ligation. This analysis is followed by a description of the mechanisms regulating RtcB activity and localisation, its known partners and its various functions from bacteria to human with a specific focus on human cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Tamoxifen is the frontline therapeutic agent for the estrogen receptor-positive (ER\u2009+\u2009) subtype of breast cancer patients, which accounts for 70-80% of total breast cancer incidents. However, clinical resistance to tamoxifen has become increasingly common, highlighting the need to identify the underlying cellular mechanisms. In our study, we employed a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen and validation experiments to discover that Tafazzin (TAZ), a mitochondrial transacylase, is crucial for maintaining the cellular sensitivity of ER+ breast cancer cells to tamoxifen and other chemotherapies. Mechanistically, we found that cardiolipin, whose synthesis and maturation rely on TAZ, is required to maintain cellular sensitivity to tamoxifen. Loss of metabolic enzymatic activity of TAZ causes ER\u03b1 downregulation and therapy resistance. Interestingly, we observed that TAZ deficiency also led to the upregulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which in turn suppressed ER\u03b1 expression and nuclear localization, thereby contributing to tamoxifen resistance. LPC is further metabolized to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive molecule that supports cell survival. Thus, our findings suggest that the depletion of TAZ promotes tamoxifen resistance through an LPC-LPA phospholipid synthesis axis, and targeting this lipid metabolic pathway could restore cell susceptibility to tamoxifen treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "High metabolic flexibility is pivotal for the persistence and therapy resistance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In 20-30% of AML patients, activating mutations of FLT3, specifically FLT3-ITD, are key therapeutic targets. Here, we investigated the influence of FLT3-ITD on AML metabolism. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) profiling showed enhanced reshuffling of pyruvate towards the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, suggesting an increased activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Consistently, FLT3-ITD-positive cells expressed high levels of PDP1, an activator of the PDC. Combining endogenous tagging of PDP1 with genome-wide CRISPR screens revealed that FLT3-ITD induces PDP1 expression through the RAS signaling axis. PDP1 knockdown resulted in reduced cellular respiration thereby impairing the proliferation of only FLT3-ITD cells. These cells continued to depend on PDP1, even in hypoxic conditions, and unlike FLT3-ITD-negative cells, they exhibited a rapid, PDP1-dependent revival of their respiratory capacity during reoxygenation. Moreover, we show that PDP1 modifies the response to FLT3 inhibition. Upon incubation with the FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor quizartinib (AC220), PDP1 persisted or was upregulated, resulting in a further shift of glucose/pyruvate metabolism towards the TCA cycle. Overexpression of PDP1 enhanced, while PDP1 depletion diminished AC220 resistance in cell lines and peripheral blasts from an AC220-resistant AML patient in vivo. In conclusion, FLT3-ITD assures the expression of PDP1, a pivotal metabolic regulator that enhances oxidative glucose metabolism and drug resistance. Hence, PDP1 emerges as a potentially targetable vulnerability in the management of AML.",

The primary endpoint was event free survival (EFS). 738 patients were randomized: 261 to each DA and IA arms and 216 to the IA\u2009+\u2009V arm. 96, 456, and 150 patients had favorable-, intermediate-, and unfavorable-risk cytogenetics, respectively. 152 were NPM1 and 158 FLT3 mutated. The overall remission rate was 77.5% including 62.5% CR and 15.0% CRi. No differences in remission, EFS, or overall survival were observed among the 3 arms except for the favorable cytogenetics subset who had improved outcomes with DA and postremission high dose cytarabine. A trend towards increased toxicity was observed with the IA and IA\u2009+\u2009V arms. The use of higher dose cytarabine during induction therapy in younger patients with AML, with or without vorinostat, does not result in improved outcomes.

Despite several efforts to reduce its incidence, AL is still seen among 2-20% of colorectal cancer patients receiving an anastomosis. The use of tissue adhesives and sealants as an extra layer of protection around the anastomosis has shown promising results. We conducted a scoping review to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the effect of tissue adhesives and sealants on colorectal anastomosis healing, as well as their effect on the postoperative outcome. The databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched on 14/10/2022. Studies addressing the use of a tissue adhesive or tissue sealant applied around a colorectal anastomosis, with the goal to prevent AL or to decrease AL-related complications, were included. We presented an overview of the available studies and summarized their results narratively. Seven studies were included out of the 846 screened. All authors reported the rate of AL in their interventions group. Five of the studies found a decreased rate of AL compared to the control group. One study had no incidences of AL, while the last study had a seemingly low rate of AL but no comparison group. Information on secondary outcomes was sparingly reported, but the results hinted at a positive effect. Tissue adhesives and sealants might have a beneficial effect on colorectal anastomosis healing.

The efficiency of the method enables chromatin profiling in single cells but is limited by the numbers of cells that can be profiled. Here, we describe a combinatorial barcoding strategy for CUT&Tag that harnesses a nanowell dispenser for simple, high-resolution, high-throughput, single-cell chromatin profiling. In this single-cell combinatorial indexing CUT&Tag (sciCUT&Tag) protocol, lightly cross-linked nuclei are bound to magnetic beads and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in bulk and then arrayed in a 96-well plate for a first round of cellular indexing by antibody-directed Tn5 tagmentation. The sample is then repooled, mixed and arrayed across 5,184 nanowells at a density of 12-24 nuclei per well for a second round of cellular indexing during PCR amplification of the sequencing-ready library. This protocol can be completed in 1.5 days by a research technician, and we illustrate the optimized protocol by profiling histone modifications associated with developmental gene repression (H3K27me3) as well as transcriptional activation (H3K4me1-2-3) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and use single-nucleotide polymorphisms to facilitate collision removal. We have also used sciCUT&Tag for simultaneous profiling of multiple chromatin epitopes in single cells.

        "AbstractText": "The PI3K pathway is one of the most frequently altered signaling pathways in human cancer. In addition to its function in cancer cells, PI3K plays a complex role in modulating anti-tumor immune responses upon immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Here, we evaluated the effects of the pan-Class I PI3K inhibitor copanlisib on different immune cell types in vitro and on tumor growth and immune cell infiltration in syngeneic murine cancer models. Intermittent treatment with copanlisib resulted in a strong in vivo anti-tumor efficacy, increased tumor infiltration of activated T cells and macrophages, and increased CD8+\u2009T cell/regulatory T cell and M1/M2 macrophage ratios. The strong in vivo efficacy was at least partially due to immunomodulatory activity of copanlisib, as in vitro these murine cancer cells were resistant to PI3K inhibition. Furthermore, the combination of copanlisib with the ICI antibody anti-PD-1 demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor efficacy in both ICI-sensitive and insensitive syngeneic mouse tumor models. Importantly, in an ICI-sensitive model, combination therapy resulted in complete remission and prevention of tumor recurrence. Thus, the combination of ICIs with PI3K inhibition by intermittently dosed copanlisib represents a promising new strategy to increase sensitivity to ICI therapies and to treat human solid cancers.",

Several studies revealed that lipid metabolism reprogramming contributed to tumorigenicity and malignancy by interfering with energy production, membrane formation, and signal transduction in cancers. ATGL is a kind of hydroxy fatty acid ester of fatty acid synthase, and its role in tumor remains controversial. We compared levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in human CRC specimens to adjacent specimens. To validate the effect of ATGL on the proliferation ability of CRC, CCK8 assay and clone formation assay were performed. To evaluate whether autophagy process takes part in the effect of ATGL on CRC proliferation, the value of LC3-II/LC3-I was detected by western blot and we blocked the SIRT1 to detect value of LC3-II/LC3-I and p62 via western blot. In the end, we detected the value of SIRT1 in CRC specimens. We found that ATGL showed high expression in CRC and positively correlated with clinical stage, indicating poor prognosis of CRC. Moreover, ATGL significantly promoted tumor cell proliferation in vitro. Mechanistically, ATGL promoted CRC cells proliferation by blocking mTOR signaling pathway and activating autophagy process. Further, ATGL regulated autophagy process through triggering SIRT1 expression. Our results reveal that ATGL promotes colorectal cancer growth by up regulating autophagy process and SIRT1 expression.",

Aberrations in the TPP1-TERT heterodimer formation might lead to short telomeres and severe diseases like dyskeratosis congenita and Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome. In the present study, we provide a thorough characterization of the structural properties of the TPP1's OB-domain by combining data coming from microsecond-long molecular dynamics calculations, time-series analyses, and graph-based networks. Our results show that the TEL-patch conformational freedom is influenced by a network of long-range amino acid communications that together determine the proper TPP1-TERT binding. Furthermore, we reveal that in TPP1 pathological variants Glu169\u0394, Lys170\u0394 and Leu95Gln, the TEL-patch plasticity is reduced, affecting the correct binding to TERT and, in turn, telomere processivity, which eventually leads to accelerated aging of affected cells.

Expression levels of miR-367-3p were determined by RT-qPCR in bladder cancer cell lines and human bladder cancer tissues. The effects of miR-367-3p on proliferation, migration and invasion were evaluated by cell colony formation assays, wound healing assays and trans-well assays, respectively. The effects of miR-367-3p and RAB23 on cisplatin sensitivity of bladder cancer cells were assessed by CCK-8 assay. The expression of its target-RAB23 was determined by western blotting in T24, 5637. Plasmids used in dual-luciferase assays were constructed to confirm the action of miR-367-3p on downstream target-RAB23 in T24 cells. And also, the role of miR-367-3p in tumorigenesis was also confirmed in nude mouse models. The downregulation of miR-367-3p was observed in human bladder cancer tissues. MiR-367-3p downregulation positively correlated with tumor stage and tumor grade. MiR-367-3p overexpression in T24, 5637 cells suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro while decreasing IC50 values under T24 and 5637 cisplatin treatment conditions. RAB23 was shown to be upregulated in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines. MiR-367-3p directly bound to the 3' UTR of RAB23 in T24 cells. RAB23 was potentially accounted for the aforementioned functions of miR-367-3p. Tumor formation experiments in nude mouse models confirmed that overexpression of miR-367-3p could inhibit tumor growth and invasion in vivo. miR-367-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer by downregulating RAB23 signaling.

This is a prospective cohort study conducted on 81 newly diagnosed cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Demographic, clinical and cancer related data were collected, patients were followed up for 6 months, and VTE events were recorded. Khorana score (KS) was calculated. Plasma D-dimer and sP-selectin were measured, and then, V-CATS score was calculated. Receiver operator curve (ROC) was used to assess the sensitivity and specificity of RAMs. A modified V-CATS was generated and subsequently assessed by using new cut-off levels of d-dimer and sP-selectin based on ROC curve of the patients' results and compared the probability of VTE occurrence using all three RAMs. Among the 81 patients included in this study, a total of 2.7% were diagnosed with advanced metastatic cancer. The most frequent cancer was non-Hodgkin lymphoma (39.5%), and 8 patients (9.8%) developed VTE events. The calculated probability of VTE occurrence using KS, V-CATS and modified V-CATS scores at cut-off levels\u2009\u2265\u20093 was 87.5%, 87.5% and 100%, respectively.

The cytotoxicity of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) against p53 wild-type (WT)/mutant-transfected RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RAFLSs) was evaluated by MTT assay. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) was employed to establish p53 WT/R211* adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model. The arthritic condition of rats was assessed by various parameters such as micro-CT analysis. Knee joint samples were isolated for total RNA sequencing analysis. The expressions of cytokines and immune-related genes were examined by qPCR, ELISA assay and immunofluorescence.

        "AbstractText": "In 2012, the CROSS trial implemented a new neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy protocol for patients with locally advanced, resectable cancer of the esophagus prior to scheduled surgery. There are only limited studies comparing the CROSS protocol with a PF-based (cisplatin/5-fluorouracil) nRCT protocol. In this retrospective, monocentric analysis, 134 patients suffering from esophageal cancer were included. Those patients received either PF-based nRCT (PF group) or nRCT according to the CROSS protocol (CROSS group) prior to elective en bloc esophagectomy. Perioperative mortality and morbidity, nRCT-related toxicity, and complete pathological regression were compared between both groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify independent factors for pathological complete response (pCR). Thirty-day/hospital mortality showed no significant differences between both groups. Postoperative complications \u2265 grade 3 according to Clavien-Dindo classification were experienced in 58.8% (PF group) and 47.6% (CROSS group) (p = 0.2) respectively. nRCT-associated toxicity \u2265 grade 3 was 30.8% (PF group) and 37.2% (CROSS group) (p = 0.6). There was no significant difference regarding the pCR rate between both groups (23.5% vs. 30.5%; p = 0.6). In multivariate analysis, SCC (OR 7.7; p < 0.01) and an initial grading of G1/G2 (OR 2.8; p = 0.03) were shown to be independent risk factors for higher rates of pCR. We conclude that both nRCT protocols are effective and safe. There were no significant differences regarding toxicity, pathological tumor response, and postoperative morbidity and mortality between both groups. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and favorable preoperative tumor grading (G1 and G2) are independent predictors for higher pCR rate in multivariate analysis.",

        "AbstractText": "Telepathology facilitates histological diagnoses through sharing expertise between pathologists. However, the associated costs are high and frequently prohibitive, especially in low-resource settings, where telepathology would paradoxically be of paramount importance due to a paucity of pathologists.We have constructed a telepathology system (TelePi) with a budget of\u2009<\u2009\u20ac120 using the small, single-board computer Raspberry Pi Zero and its High-Quality Camera Module in conjunction with a standard microscope and open-source software. The system requires no maintenance costs or service contracts, has a small footprint, can be moved and shared across several microscopes, and is independent from other computer operating systems. TelePi uses a responsive and high-resolution web-based live stream which allows remote consultation between two or more locations. TelePi can serve as a telepathology system for remote diagnostics of frozen sections. Additionally, it can be used as a standard microscope camera for teaching of medical students and for basic research. The quality of the TelePi system compared favorable to a commercially available telepathology system that exceed its cost by more than 125-fold. Additionally, still images are of publication quality equal to that of a whole slide scanner that costs 800 times more.In summary, TelePi is an affordable, versatile, and inexpensive camera system that potentially enables telepathology in low-resource settings without sacrificing image quality.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Deubiquitinases in cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Ubiquitination is an essential regulator of most, if not all, signalling pathways, and defects in cellular signalling are central to cancer initiation, progression and, eventually, metastasis. The attachment of ubiquitin signals by E3 ubiquitin ligases is directly opposed by the action of approximately 100 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in humans. Together, DUBs and E3 ligases coordinate ubiquitin signalling by providing selectivity for different substrates and/or ubiquitin signals. The balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination is exquisitely controlled to ensure properly coordinated proteostasis and response to cellular stimuli and stressors. Not surprisingly, then, DUBs have been associated with all hallmarks of cancer. These relationships are often complex and multifaceted, highlighted by the implication of\u00a0multiple DUBs in certain hallmarks and by the impact of\u00a0individual DUBs on multiple cancer-associated pathways, sometimes with contrasting cancer-promoting and cancer-inhibiting activities, depending on context and tumour type. Although it is\u00a0still understudied, the ever-growing knowledge of DUB function in cancer physiology will eventually identify DUBs that warrant specific inhibition or activation, both of which are now feasible. An integrated appreciation of the physiological consequences of DUB modulation in relevant cancer models will eventually lead to the identification of patient populations that will most likely benefit from DUB-targeted therapies.",

        "AbstractText": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of early PSA decline following initiation of second-generation hormone therapy (2nd HT), namely abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, in patients with taxane-refractory metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and evaluate utility of this metric in informing intensified surveillance/imaging protocols. We retrospectively identified 75 mCRPC patients treated with 2nd HT following docetaxel failure (defined as PSA rise and radiographic progression). Patients were categorized patients into two cohorts based on the first PSA within 3 months after initiation of therapy: PSA reduction \u226550% (Group A) and PSA reduction <50% (Group B). The primary endpoint was cancer-specific mortality (CSM). The secondary endpoint was radiographic disease progression (rDP) on 2nd HT. In univariate and multivariate analyses, we investigated factors associated with rPD and CSM. We included 75 patients (52 in Group A, 23 in Group B) in the analytic cohort. Baseline clinico-demographic characteristics, including median age, primary Gleason score risk group, median pre-treatment PSA, disease burden, site of metastases, and pre-treatment ECOG score were not statistically different between the two groups. Median follow up time was 30 months and the median time to radiographic disease progression was 28.1 and 12.5 months (p\u2009=\u20090.002) in cohorts A and B, respectively. On univariate and multivariate analyses, both PSA reduction \u226550% and volume of metastatic disease were significantly associated with a decreased risk of radiographic disease progression (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21-0.80, p\u2009=\u20090.0113) as well as a decreased risk of cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.09-0.87, p\u2009=\u20090.0325). PSA reduction \u226550% within 3 months of starting 2nd HT was associated with significantly improved radiographic disease progression-free survival and 3-year cancer-specific mortality. This suggests using PSA 50%-decline metric in surveillance patients with on 2nd HT and identifies patients who require further evaluation with imaging.",

        "AbstractText": "This study evaluated photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for treatment of trismus in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC). Sixteen patients, 10 men and 6 women, who had a mouth opening\u2009<\u200935\u00a0mm and underwent RT were included. The patients were evaluated daily before and after the PBMT application, measuring mouth opening and performing pain scores for the masticatory muscles using the visual analog scale (VAS). We used the infrared laser (~\u2009808\u00a0nm) extraorally, 0.1 W power, 3\u00a0J energy, 30\u00a0s (107\u00a0J/cm2) per point, applied to temporalis anterior, masseter muscles, and temporomandibular joints (TMJ). An intraoral point was made in the trigonoretromolar region towards the medial pterygoid muscle. The mean mouth opening of the patients increased by more than 7\u00a0mm throughout the treatment. The pain scores on the initial days showed an immediate reduction after PBMT on the ipsilateral side in the muscles and TMJ. Throughout PBMT applications, there was a significant reduction in pain scores in all muscles and the TMJ. The radiation dose of all patients was above 40\u00a0Gy, which is the threshold dose for the risk of developing trismus. SPSS software was used and adopted a confidence of 95%. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, Wilcoxon test, and Spearman correlation were performed. PBMT controls muscular pain and reduced mouth opening limitation in HNC during radiotherapy. Further studies are needed to evaluate the preventive capacity of PBMT protocols for RT trismus-related HNC.",

        "AbstractText": "The aim of this study is to present the diagnostic accuracy of MRI and PET/CT in the evaluation of cervical lymph nodes in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Data of 114 patients who underwent MRI and PET/CT prior to surgery in the time period between January 2010 and September 2021 in our center is analyzed retrospectively. Histopathological results of surgical preparations serve as the gold standard. The mean time from MRI to surgery is 22.9 (\u00b1\u200918.7)\u00a0days, and from PET/CT to surgery 21.7 (\u00b1\u200919.9)\u00a0days. Sensitivities of 80.4% and 80.4%, specificities of 85.7% and 87.3%, PPVs of 82.0% and 83.7% and NPVs of 84.4% and 84.6% are registered for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. 37 false results are further analyzed with respect to side and level of the affected lymph node, as well as intersections of the two imaging modalities. In 29 patients (25.4%), additional findings are described in PET/CT, 7 (6.1%) of which were histologically confirmed to be further malignancies. A combination of both MRI and PET/CT imaging modalities could improve diagnostic accuracy, especially with regard to sensitivity. A notable number of additional findings in whole body acquisition leads to the potential diagnosis of further malignancies.",

        "AbstractText": "The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of shell (coating) formulations comprised of alginate and glucono delta lactone (GDL) to encapsulate a mixture of green tea and turmeric extracts. Three concentrations of alginate and GDL were used at 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1%, w/v and their solid ratio was varied using a factorial design. A response surface model was applied to optimize the retention of catechin and curcuminoid contents, to determine encapsulation efficiency, and to minimize undesirable flavor and taste. Increasing the concentration of alginate and GDL significantly increased the retention of catechin and curcuminoid contents, encapsulation efficiency, and consumer acceptance (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The encapsulating solution containing 1% of each alginate and GDL performed the best against each criterion. The thermal treatment carried out at the boiling point of water for 15\u00a0min had a significant impact on the retention of catechin and curcuminoid content which, in the thermally-treated beads, was 5.15 and 3.85 times higher than unencapsulated, respectively. The consumer acceptance of the encapsulated beads after thermal treatment was higher than that of the unencapsulated formulations as they exhibited lesser pungent flavor and bitterness. The innovative process of thermally stable microencapsulation can produce anti-cancer activity compounds involved in functional food industrial sectors.",

        "AbstractText": "Despite the ups and downs in the field over three decades, the science of gene therapy has continued to advance and provide enduring treatments for increasing number of diseases. There are active clinical trials approaching a variety of inherited and acquired disorders of different organ systems. Approaches include ex vivo modification of hematologic stem cells (HSC), T lymphocytes and other immune cells, as well as in vivo delivery of genes or gene editing reagents to the relevant target cells by either local or systemic administration. In this article, we highlight success and ongoing challenges in three areas of high activity in gene therapy: inherited blood cell diseases by targeting hematopoietic stem cells, malignant disorders using immune effector cells genetically modified with chimeric antigen receptors, and ophthalmologic, neurologic, and coagulation disorders using in vivo administration of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. In recent years, there have been true cures for many of these diseases, with sustained clinical benefit that exceed those from other medical approaches. Each of these treatments faces ongoing challenges, namely their high one-time costs and the complexity of manufacturing the therapeutic agents, which are biological viruses and cell products, at pharmacologic standards of quality and consistency. New models of reimbursement are needed to make these innovative treatments widely available to patients in need.",
