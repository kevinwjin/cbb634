Among the DNA sensors, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a primary player in detecting cytosolic DNA, including foreign DNA from pathogens and self-DNA released during cellular damage, culminating in a type I interferon (IFN-I) response through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation. IFN-I cytokines are essential in mediating neuroinflammation, which is widely observed in CNS injury, neurodegeneration, and aging, suggesting an upstream role for the cGAS DNA sensing pathway. In this review, we summarize the latest developments on the cGAS-STING DNA-driven immune response in various neurological diseases and conditions. Our review covers the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cGAS activation and highlights cGAS-STING signaling in various cell types of central and peripheral nervous systems, such as resident brain immune cells, neurons, and glial cells. We then discuss the role of cGAS-STING signaling in different neurodegenerative conditions, including tauopathies, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as aging and senescence. Finally, we lay out the current advancements in research and development of cGAS inhibitors and assess the prospects of targeting cGAS and STING as therapeutic strategies for a wide spectrum of neurological diseases.", "query": "alzheimers"}, "37940962": {"ArticleTitle": "Peptide-based approaches to directly target alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease.", "AbstractText": "Peptides and their mimetics are increasingly recognised as drug-like molecules, particularly for intracellular protein-protein interactions too large for inhibition by small molecules, and inaccessible to larger biologics. In the past two decades, evidence associating the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein strongly implicates this protein in disease onset and progression of Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. The subsequent formation of toxic, intracellular, Lewy body deposits, in which alpha-synuclein is a major component, is a key diagnostic hallmark of the disease. To reach their therapeutic site of action, peptides must both cross the blood-brain barrier and enter dopaminergic neurons to prevent the formation of these intracellular inclusions. In this review, we describe and summarise the current efforts made in the development of peptides and their mimetics to directly engage with alpha-synuclein with the intention of modulating aggregation, and importantly, toxicity. This is a rapidly expanding field with great socioeconomic impact; these molecules harbour significant promise as therapeutics, or as early biomarkers during prodromal disease stages, or both. As these are age-dependent conditions, an increasing global life expectancy means disease prevalence is rising. No current treatments exist to either prevent or slow disease progression.

To bridge this gap, we established an amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2O)-induced rat model of AD and subjected it to intermittent sleep deprivation (SD). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transmission electron microscopy were employed to assess white matter (WM) integrity and ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths. Our findings demonstrated that SD exacerbated A\u03b2O-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, we found SD aggravated A\u03b2O-induced asymmetrical impairments in WM, presenting with reductions in tract integrity observed in commissural fibers and association fasciculi, particularly the right anterior commissure, right corpus callosum, and left cingulum. Ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths within the hippocampus and corpus callosum further confirmed a lateralized effect. Moreover, SD worsened A\u03b2O-induced lateralized disruption of the brain structural network, with impairments in critical nodes of the left hemisphere strongly correlated with cognitive dysfunction. This work represents the first identification of a lateralized impact of SD on the mesoscopic network and cognitive deficits in an AD rat model. These findings could deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between sleep disturbance and AD pathology, providing valuable insights into the early progression of the disease, as well as the development of neuroimaging biomarkers for screening early AD patients with self-reported sleep disturbances. Enhanced understanding of these mechanisms may pave the way for targeted interventions to alleviate cognitive decline and improve the quality of life for individuals at risk of or affected by AD. a\u00a0A\u03b2O injection and sleep deprivation were conducted on adult rats. b Sleep deprivation and A\u03b2O-induced neurotoxicity aggravated cognitive disability with a synergistic effect. c Sleep deprivation and A\u03b2O-induced neurotoxicity reduced the integrity of specific association fasciculi and commissural fibers with ultrastructural demyelination. d On the basis of white matter integrity destruction, the structural connection was disrupted.

Emerging evidence, mostly from cell and animal models of disease, supports a role for ketosis in general, and the main circulating ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in particular, in reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation to ameliorate chronic inflammation. As a result, interventions that can induce ketosis (e.g., fasting, intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding/eating, very low-carbohydrate high-fat ketogenic diets) and/or increase circulating BHB (e.g., exogenous ketone supplementation) have garnered increasing interest for their therapeutic potential. The purpose of the present review is to summarize our current understanding of the literature on how ketogenic interventions impact the NLRP3 inflammasome across human, rodent and cell models. Overall, there is convincing evidence that ketogenic interventions, likely acting through multiple interacting mechanisms in a cell-, disease- and context-specific manner, can reduce NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

It is characterized by both cognitive and functional impairment. However, as AD has an unclear pathological cause, it can be hard to diagnose with confidence. This is even more so in the early stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This paper proposes a U-Net based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) from magnetic resonance imaging - T1 weighted imaging (MRI-T1WI) for further usage in AD diagnosis including its early-stage MCI. The experiments have displayed promising results with Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) reaching 0.9714. Furthermore, three types of classifiers are developed, i.e., one Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier, two Graph Neural Network (GNN) based classifiers where one is for graph classification and the other is for node classification. 10-fold cross-validation has been conducted on all trials of experiments for classifier comparison. The performance of these three types of classifiers has been compared with the different input modalities setting and data fusion strategies. The results have shown that GNN based node classifier surpasses the other two types of classifiers, and has achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with the best accuracy at 90.18% for 3-class classification, namely AD, MCI and normal control (NC) with the synthesized fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) features fused at the input level. Moreover, involving synthesized FDG-PET as part of the input with proper data fusion strategies has also proved to enhance all three types of classifiers' performance.

The Au-Cu alloy NPs were prepared via a co-reduction reaction, exhibiting excellent conductivity and catalytic activity. These properties remarkably enhanced the ECL of luminol, providing a suitable background for the sensing response. After the Au-Cu NPs were decorated on the surface of indium tin oxide glass using 3-amino-propyl trimethoxysilane, the antibody of p-tau217 was immobilized via dominant Au-N bonding to enable the biological specificity of the immunosensor. When p-tau217 specifically interacted with an antibody to form an immune complex on the sensing interface, the ECL signal of the sensor was considerably inhibited by the resulting giant biomolecular complex. This complex prevented luminol diffusion to the electrode surface and electron transfer. The resulting immunosensor showed remarkable sensitivity to p-tau217, with a wide linear detection range from 5 to 600 pg/mL. A detection limit of 0.56 pg/mL was achieved, with recoveries in human serum ranging from 92.3 to 109%.

Kinetic studies of the second-generation glyco-pseudodendrimer revealed maximum inhibition of A\u03b2 40 aggregates, verified with atomic force microscopy.

It serves as a design for cellular machinery that permits cells, organs, and even whole organisms to work. The fidelity of DNA replication results from the action of hundreds of genes involved in proofreading and damage repair. All human cells can acquire genetic changes in their DNA all over life. Genetic mutations are changes to the DNA sequence that happen during cell division when the cells make copies of themselves. Mutations in the DNA can cause genetic illnesses such as cancer, or they could help humans better adapt to their environment over time. The endogenous reactive metabolites, therapeutic medicines, and an excess of environmental mutagens, such as UV rays all continuously damage DNA, compromising its integrity. One or more chromosomal alterations and point mutations at a single site (monogenic mutation) including deletions, duplications, and inversions illustrate such DNA mutations. Genetic conditions can occur when an altered gene is inherited from parents, which increases the risk of developing that particular condition, or some gene alterations can happen randomly. Moreover, symptoms of genetic conditions depend on which gene has a mutation. There are many different diseases and conditions caused by mutations. Some of the most common genetic conditions are Alzheimer's disease, some cancers, cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, and sickle cell disease.

In this work, we develop a deep learning method that models the evolution of age-related disease by processing a single medical scan and providing a segmentation of the target anatomy at a requested future point in time. Our method represents a time-invariant physical process and solves a large-scale problem of modeling temporal pixel-level changes utilizing NeuralODEs. In addition, we demonstrate the approaches to incorporate the prior domain-specific constraints into our method and define temporal Dice loss for learning temporal objectives. To evaluate the applicability of our approach across different age-related diseases and imaging modalities, we developed and tested the proposed method on the datasets with 967 retinal OCT volumes of 100 patients with Geographic Atrophy and 2823 brain MRI volumes of 633 patients with Alzheimer's Disease. For Geographic Atrophy, the proposed method outperformed the related baseline models in the atrophy growth prediction.

In this work, we performed combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and well-tempered metadynamics to understand the modulation of human AChE (hAChE) activity using three alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, and K+) in different concentrations. Our simulations show that the binding affinity and catalytic activity are affected by different ion species through allosteric ion coordination geometries on the hAChE complex and distant electrostatic screening effect. A Li+ cluster involving D330, E393, and D397 residues and three Li+ ions was found to be highly conserved and can be critical to the enzyme activity. Binding energy calculations indicate that the electrostatic screening from allosterically bound cations can affect the key residues at the catalytic site and active-site gorge, including E199. Furthermore, an increase in ion concentration can lead to lower reactivity, especially for Li+ ions, which exhibit more cation-hAChE contacts than Na+ and K+.

O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by 2 enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Development of a PET tracer would therefore be an essential tool for developing therapeutic small-molecule inhibitors of OGA, enabling clinical testing of target engagement and dose selection. Methods: A collection of small-molecule compounds was screened for inhibitory activity and high-affinity binding to OGA, as well as favorable PET tracer attributes (multidrug resistance protein 1 efflux, central nervous system PET multiparameter optimization, etc.). Two lead compounds with high affinity and selectivity for OGA were selected for further profiling, including OGA binding to tissue homogenate using a radioligand competition binding assay. In vivo pharmacokinetics were established using a microdosing approach with unlabeled compounds in rats. In vivo imaging studies were performed in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with 11C-labeled compounds. Results: Two selected candidates, BIO-735 and BIO-578, displayed promising attributes in\u00a0vitro. After radiolabeling with tritium, [3H]BIO-735 and [3H]BIO-578 binding in rodent brain homogenates demonstrated dissociation constants of 0.6 and 2.3\u2009nM, respectively. Binding was inhibited, concentration-dependently, by homologous compounds and thiamet G, a well-characterized and structurally diverse OGA inhibitor. Imaging studies in rats and NHPs showed both tracers had high uptake in the brain and inhibition of binding to OGA in the presence of a nonradioactive compound. However, only BIO-578 demonstrated reversible binding kinetics within the time frame of a PET study with a 11C-labeled molecule to enable quantification using kinetic modeling. Specificity of tracer uptake was confirmed with a 10\u2009mg/kg blocking dose of thiamet G. Conclusion: We describe the development and testing of 2 11C PET tracers targeting the protein OGA. The lead compound BIO-578 demonstrated high affinity and selectivity for OGA in rodent and human postmortem brain tissue, leading to its further testing in NHPs.

Despite a large body of evidence documenting age-related deficits in spatial navigation, comparatively less research addresses how to facilitate more effective navigation behavior for older adults. Since navigation challenges arise for a variety of reasons in old age, a one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely to work. Here, we introduce a framework for the variety of spatial navigation challenges faced in aging, which we call LOST-Location, Orientation, Spatial mapping, and Transit. The LOST framework builds on evidence from the cognitive neuroscience of spatial navigation, which reveals distinct components underpinning human wayfinding. We evaluate research on navigational aids-devices and depictions-which help people find their way around; and we reflect on how navigation aids solve (or fail to solve) specific wayfinding difficulties faced by older adults. In summary, we emphasize a bespoke approach to improving spatial navigation in aging, which focuses on tailoring navigation solutions to specific navigation challenges. Our hope is that by providing precise support to older navigators, navigation opportunities can facilitate independence and exploration, while minimizing the danger of becoming lost. We conclude by delineating critical knowledge gaps in how to improve older adults' spatial navigation capacities that the novel LOST framework could guide to address.

Astrocytes not only provide homeostatic support to neurons but also actively regulate synaptic signaling and functions and become reactive in response to CNS insults through diverse signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT, NF-\u03baB, and GPCR-elicited pathways. The advent of new technology for transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level has led to increasing recognition of the highly versatile nature of reactive astrocytes and the context-dependent specificity of astrocyte reactivity. In AD, reactive astrocytes have long been observed in senile plaques and have recently been suggested to play a role in AD pathogenesis and progression. However, the precise contributions of reactive astrocytes to AD remain elusive, and targeting this complex cell population for AD treatment poses significant challenges. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of astrocyte reactivity and its role in AD, with a particular focus on the signaling pathways that promote astrocyte reactivity and the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes.

This was addressed in the present study by investigating the effect of chronic neuropathic pain on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive impairment using amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice subjected to spared-nerve injury (SNI). The Von Frey test was performed to determine the mechanical threshold of mouse hind limbs after SNI. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory. Doublecortin-positive (DCX+), 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)+, BrdU+/neuronal nuclei (NeuN)+, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)+ neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. CCL2 and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) protein levels in the mouse hippocampus were analyzed by western blotting. The results showed that APP/PS1 mice with chronic neuropathic pain induced by SNI had significant learning and memory impairment. This was accompanied by increased CCL2 and CCR2 expression and decreases in the number of DCX+, BrdU+, and BrdU+/NeuN+ neurons.

The effect of environmental risk factors on the extent of axonal injury during this prodrome is unknown. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study was to determine if HHV-6A serostatus is associated with the level of sNfL in the multiple sclerosis prodrome, which would support a causative role of HHV-6A. A nested case-control study was performed by crosslinking multiple sclerosis registries with Swedish biobanks. Individuals with biobank samples collected before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis were included as cases. Controls without multiple sclerosis were randomly selected, matched for biobank, sex, sampling date and age. Serostatus of HHV-6A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was analysed with a bead-based multiplex assay. The concentration of sNfL was analysed with Single molecule array technology. The association between HHV-6A serology and sNfL was assessed by stratified t-tests and linear regressions, adjusted for EBV serostatus and sampling age. Within-pair ratios of HHV-6A seroreactivity and sNfL were calculated for each case and its matched control. To assess the temporal relationship between HHV-6A antibodies and sNfL, these ratios were plotted against the time to the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis and compared using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing regressions with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Samples from 519 matched case-control pairs were included. In cases, seropositivity of HHV-6A was significantly associated with the level of sNfL (+11%, 95% CI 0.2-24%, P\u2009=\u20090.045), and most pronounced in the younger half of the cases (+24%, 95% CI 6-45%, P\u2009=\u20090.007).

Increasing seroreactivity against HHV-6A was detectable before the rise of sNfL (significant within-pair ratios from 13.6 years vs 6.6 years before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis).

The inherent barrier properties of the BBB pose a challenge for therapeutic drug delivery into the CNS to treat neurological diseases. Impaired BBB function has been related to neurological disease. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the deposition of amyloid in the cerebral vasculature leading to a compromised BBB, is a co-morbidity in most cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that BBB dysfunction or breakdown may be involved in neurodegeneration. Due to limited access to human BBB tissue, the mechanisms that contribute to proper BBB function and BBB degeneration remain unknown. To address these limitations, we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived BBB (iBBB) by incorporating endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes in a 3D matrix. The iBBB self-assembles to recapitulate the anatomy and cellular interactions present in the BBB. Seeding iBBBs with amyloid captures key aspects of CAA. Additionally, the iBBB offers a flexible platform to modulate genetic and environmental factors implicated in cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration, to investigate how genetics and lifestyle affect disease risk. Finally, the iBBB can be used for drug screening and medicinal chemistry studies to optimize therapeutic\u00a0delivery to the CNS. In this protocol, we describe the differentiation of the three types of cells (endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes) arising from human pluripotent stem cells, how to assemble the differentiated cells into the iBBB, and how to model CAA in vitro using exogenous amyloid.

Being an insect, Drosophila has a robust and advanced olfactory system that has been used many times as a model neuronal circuit to study fundamental questions in neurobiology. The circuit is well-explored at anatomical, physiological, and functional levels. It provides several advantages for the study of neurobiological disorders, such as spatiotemporally regulated misexpression or knockdown of disease proteins, genetic tractability, well-studied neuroanatomy, simple behavioural training paradigms, and quantifiable assays. Hence, Drosophila olfaction has been a favourite choice for the study of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome, etc. This review aims to discuss earlier progress and future scope in using the Drosophila olfactory system for modelling human neurological pathophysiology for conducting fundamental and applied research. A major goal of research in biological science is to alleviate human disease burden. Diverse experimental systems are required to address different aspects of disease aetiology. Drosophila is one of the finest in vivo systems; its olfactory system is arguably the most well-characterized circuit for modelling human neurological disorders.

Methods and Results Using 2013 to 2017 US Medicare claims linked to Minimum Data Set records, we conducted a retrospective cohort study. We identified DOAC initiators (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban) aged \u226565\u2009years with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation residing in a nursing home. We estimated inverse-probability of treatment weights for DOAC dose using propensity scores. We examined safety (hospitalization for major bleeding) and effectiveness outcomes (all-cause mortality, thrombosis [myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, venous thromboembolism]). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs using cause-specific hazard-regression models. Of 21\u2009878 DOAC initiators, 48% received reduced dosing. The mean age of residents was 82.0\u2009years, 66% were female, and 31% had moderate/severe cognitive impairment. After estimating inverse-probability of treatment weights, standard dosing was associated with a higher rate of bleeding (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.03-1.37]; 9.4 versus 8.0 events per 100 person-years). Standard-dose therapy was associated with the highest rates of bleeding among those aged >80\u2009years (9.1 versus 6.7 events per 100\u2009person-years) and with a body mass index <30\u2009kg/m2 (9.4 versus 7.4 events per 100\u2009person-years).

AD patients usually present symptoms, such as cognitive dysfunction, progressive memory loss, and other manifestations. With the increasing number of AD cases worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop effective drug treatments.

In this review, we summarized both cellular and animal studies and described the mechanism of action of curcumin in altering the pathological features of AD. Curcumin attenuates the formation of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and promotes its decomposition, reduces the phosphorylation of tau, improves its clearance rate, and binds with copper to reduce cholesterol. It changes the activity of microglia, suppresses acetylcholinesterase, regulates insulin signal transduction, and exhibits antioxidant properties.

According to the NIA-AA (National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association) framework, we selected three AD biomarker genes (APP, NEFL, and MAPT). We systematically screened transcript-level exonic rare SNPs from these genes with a minor allele frequency of 1% in 1KGD (1000 Genomes Project Database) and gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database). With downstream functional effect predictions, a single variation (rs182024939: K > N) of the MAPT gene with nine transcript SNPs was identified as the most pathogenic variation from the large dataset of mutations. The machine learning consensus classifier predictor categorized these transcript-level SNPs as the most deleterious variations, resulting in a large decrease in protein structural stability (\u0394\u0394G kcal/mol). The bioactive flavonoid library was screened for drug-likeness and toxicity risk. Virtual screening of eligible flavonoids was performed using the MAPT protein. Identification of druggable protein-binding cavities showed VAL305, GLU655, and LYS657 as consensus-interacting residues present in the MAPT-docked top-ranked flavonoid compounds. The MM/PB(GB)SA analysis indicated hesperetin (-5.64 kcal/mol), eriodictyol (-5.63 kcal/mol), and sakuranetin (-5.60 kcal/mol) as the best docked flavonoids with the near-native binding pose.

This communication is facilitated by rapid signaling through electrical and chemical messengers, including voltage-gated ion channels and neurotransmitters. These messengers elicit broad responses by propagating action potentials and mediating synaptic transmission. Calcium influx and efflux are essential for releasing neurotransmitters and regulating synaptic transmission. Mitochondria, which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and the energy generation process, also interact with the endoplasmic reticulum to store and regulate cytoplasmic calcium levels. The number, morphology, and distribution of mitochondria in different cell types vary based on energy demands. Mitochondrial damage can cause excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Mitophagy is a selective process that targets and degrades damaged mitochondria via autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Defects in mitophagy can lead to a buildup of ROS and cell death. Numerous studies have attempted to characterize the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinocerebellar ataxia, and aging. Interventional strategies to reduce mitochondrial damage and accumulation could serve as a therapeutic target, but further research is needed to unravel this potential.

Some have hypothesized that brain-inhabiting organisms induce chronic neuroinflammation, leading to the development of a spectrum of NDs. Bacteria such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, and Cutibacterium acnes have been found to inhabit the brains of ND patients. Furthermore, several fungi, including Candida and Malassezia species, have been identified in the central nervous system of these patients. However, there remains several limitations to the brain microbiome hypothesis. Varying results across the literature, concerns regarding sample contamination, and the presence of exogenous deoxyribonucleic acids have led to doubts about the hypothesis. These results provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of NDs. Herein, we provide a review of the evidence for and against the brain microbiome theory and describe the difficulties facing the hypothesis. Additionally, we define possible mechanisms of bacterial invasion of the brain and organism-related neurodegeneration in NDs and the potential therapeutic premises of this theory.", "query": "alzheimers"}, "37910286": {"ArticleTitle": "Regulated Necrosis in Glaucoma: Focus on Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia and is anticipated to impose a substantial economic burden in the future.

With the increase in aged population, there is a prevalence of irreversible neurodegenerative changes, causing a significant mental, social, and economic burden globally. The factors contributing to AD are multidimensional, highly complex, and not completely understood. However, it is widely known that aging, neuroinflammation, and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with other free radicals, substantially contribute to oxidative stress and cell death, which are inextricably linked. While oxidative stress is undeniably important in AD, limiting free radicals and ROS levels is an intriguing and potential strategy for deferring the process of neurodegeneration and alleviating associated symptoms. Therapeutic compounds from natural sources have recently become increasingly accepted and have been effectively studied for AD treatment. These phytocompounds are widely available and a multitude of holistic therapeutic efficiencies for treating AD owing to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and biological activities. Some of these compounds also function by stimulating cholinergic neurotransmission, facilitating the suppression of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1, \u03b1-synuclein, and monoamine oxidase proteins, and deterring the occurrence of AD. Additionally, various phenolic, flavonoid, and terpenoid phytocompounds have been extensively described as potential palliative agents for AD progression.

It has been widely used for its anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects. It is commonly used for its cardiovascular benefits and is prescribed as secondary prophylaxis after a heart attack. Furthermore, low-dose, long-term ASA is used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in individuals without prior cardiovascular disease. Acetylsalicylic acid acts as a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX), which inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins and prevents pro-inflammatory cytokines. Findings suggest that targeting cytokines and growth factors could be a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing neuroinflammation and slowing down the progression of dementia. Additionally, prostaglandins contribute to synaptic plasticity and can act as retrograde messengers in synapses. Research has implicated COX-1, one of the isoforms of the enzyme, in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders. The inhibition of COX-1 might potentially prevent impairments in working memory and reduce neuroinflammation caused by beta-amyloid proteins in some conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cyclooxygenase-2, an inducible form of the enzyme, is expressed in cortical and hippocampal neurons and is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. The inhibition or knockout of COX-2 has been shown to decrease long-term potentiation, a process involved in memory formation. Studies have also demonstrated that the administration of COX-2 inhibitors impairs cognitive function and memory acquisition and recall in animal models. There remains a debate regarding the effects of aspirin on dementia and cognitive decline. Although some studies suggest a possible protective effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, against the development of AD, others have shown inconsistent evidence.

However, the ephemeral nature of nucleation has made this goal unachievable with existing biochemistry, structural biology, and computational approaches. Here, we addressed that limitation for polyglutamine (polyQ), a polypeptide sequence that causes Huntington's and other amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases when its length exceeds a characteristic threshold. To identify essential features of the polyQ amyloid nucleus, we used a direct intracellular reporter of self-association to quantify frequencies of amyloid appearance as a function of concentration, conformational templates, and rational polyQ sequence permutations. We found that nucleation of pathologically expanded polyQ involves segments of three glutamine (Q) residues at every other position. We demonstrate using molecular simulations that this pattern encodes a four-stranded steric zipper with interdigitated Q side chains. Once formed, the zipper poisoned its own growth by engaging naive polypeptides on orthogonal faces, in a fashion characteristic of polymer crystals with intramolecular nuclei. We further show that self-poisoning can be exploited to block amyloid formation, by genetically oligomerizing polyQ prior to nucleation.

Once the process starts, amyloids will continue to form, leading to worse symptoms that cannot be cured. The best way to treat these diseases is therefore to stop amyloids from arising in the first place. Amyloids initially develop by proteins coming together to create an unstable structure referred to as the nucleus. The instability of the nucleus means it cannot be observed directly, making it hard to study this nucleation process. To overcome this, Kandola, Venkatesan et al. investigated the simplest protein known to form an amyloid \u2013 polyglutamine, which is made up of a chain of repeating building blocks known as amino acids. Polyglutamine forms only one type of amyloid which is associated with nine neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington\u2019s disease. However, it only does this when its chain of amino acids exceeds a certain length, suggesting that a specific structure may be required for nucleation to begin. Kandola, Venkatesan et al. made alternative versions of the polyglutamine protein which each contained slightly different sequences of amino acids that will alter the way the protein folds. They then tested how well these different variants could form amyloids in yeast cells. This revealed that in order to join together into a nucleus, polyglutamine needs to be able to fold into a zipper shape made up of four interlocking strands. The length of the protein required to form this shape is also the same length that causes the amyloid associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Kandola, Venkatesan et al. also found that polyglutamine tends to bind to nuclei that have already formed in a way that hinders their growth. This \u2018self-poisoning\u2019 affect could potentially be exploited as a way to pre-emptively stop amyloids from initially arising. These findings have uncovered a potential therapeutic strategy for blocking amyloid formation that could eventually benefit people with or at risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases linked to polyglutamine. Additionally, this approach provides a blueprint for understanding how other proteins undergo amyloid nucleation, including those responsible for Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and other diseases.", "query": "alzheimers"}, "37895468": {"ArticleTitle": "Therapeutic Potential of Myrtenal and Its Derivatives-A Review.", "AbstractText": "This paper aims to establish a coupling model of neuronal populations and astrocytes and, on this basis, explore the possible mechanism of electroencephalography (EEG) slowing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the viewpoint of dynamical modeling. First and foremost, excitatory and inhibitory time constants are shown to induce the early symptoms of AD. The corresponding dynamic nature is mainly due to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the oscillatory behavior. However, there are also a few cases that can be attributed to the change of the oscillation mode caused by the limit cycle bifurcation and birhythmicity. Then, an improved neural mass model influenced by astrocytes is proposed, considering the important effects of glutamate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by astrocytes on the synaptic transmission process reported in experiments. The results show that a dysfunctional astrocyte disrupts the physiological state, causing three typical EEG slowing phenomena reported clinically: the decreased dominant frequency, the decreased rhythmic activity in the \u03b1 band, and the increased rhythmic activity in the \u03b4+\u03b8 band. In addition, astrocytes may control AD when the effect of ATP on synaptic connections is greater than that of glutamate. The control rate depends on the ratio of the effect of glutamate on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. These modeling results can not only reproduce some experimental and clinical results, but, more importantly, may offer a prediction of some underlying phenomena, helping to inspire the disease mechanisms and therapeutic methods of targeting astrocytes.", "query": "alzheimers"}, "37895420": {"ArticleTitle": "Ion Channels and Ionotropic Receptors in Astrocytes: Physiological Functions and Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease and Glioblastoma.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease where abnormal amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) occurs and has been linked to neuronal dysfunction. Hypometabolism of glucose in the brain can lead to synaptic loss and neuronal death, which in turn exacerbates energy deficiency and amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) accumulation. Lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis serves as an energy substrate supporting neuronal function and facilitating neuronal repair. Vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4) has been recognized as a key regulator of the hypoxia-sensing pathway. However, the role of VGLL4 in AD remains unexplored. Here, we reported that the expression of VGLL4 protein was significantly decreased in the brain tissue of AD model mice and AD model cells. We further found that overexpression of VGLL4 reduced APP amyloidogenic processing and ameliorated neuronal synaptic damage. Notably, we identified a compromised hypoxia-sensitive capability of LDHA regulated by VGLL4 in the context of AD. Upregulation of VGLL4 increased the response of LDHA to hypoxia and enhanced the expression levels of LDHA and lactate by inhibiting the ubiquitination and degradation of LDHA. Furthermore, the inhibition of lactate production by using sodium oxamate, an inhibitor of LDHA, suppressed the neuroprotective function of VGLL4 by increasing APP amyloidogenic processing. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that VGLL4 exerts a neuroprotective effect by upregulating LDHA expression and consequently promoting lactate production.

Dementia was commonly viewed by people living with dementia as part of ageing and carers reported low levels awareness about the condition. To avoid negative reactions from people, people living with dementia managed the negative views of dementia by minimising and normalising the condition, by expressing their ability to live an active life, and by emphasising the positive impacts of dementia in their lives. Fear of negative reactions appeared to lead to a selective disclosure of their diagnosis. Among carers, stigmatising attitudes coincided with a strong willingness to provide good care, to protect the person cared for, as well as to understand and validate their caring experiences, rather than to cause harm.

In this study, network pharmacological analysis predicted 40 candidate compounds in LWD, acting on 227 potential targets, of which 185 were associated with AD.

In this experiment, LWD was detected in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model. The objective was to observe the effects of LWD on hippocampal learning and memory ability, A\u03b2 clearance, autophagy and inflammatory response in APP/PS1 mice. The results showed that LWD improved long-term memory and working memory in APP/PS1 mice compared with the WT group. At the same time, LWD can increase the expression of hippocampal autophagy biomarkers, reduce the precipitation of A\u03b2, and the activation of microglia and astrocytes.

STZ worsened spatial memory in the YMT, as well as short-term (STM) and long-term (LTM) memories in the ORT and ODT, respectively. EXE-4 protected against memory impairment in STZ animals. STZ reduced mature neuron density (NeuN) and increased cell apoptosis (CC3) in the DG, CA1, and CA3. EXE-4 protected against neuronal death in all regions. EXE-4 increased PCNA+ cells in all regions of the hippocampus, and STZ attenuated this effect. STZ reduced neurogenesis in DG per se as well as synaptogenesis induced by EXE-4.

Using a recombinant hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) synthesized by the PIMAX approach, we examined how cells responded to the cytotoxic tau and explored means to enhance cellular resistance to tau attack. Upon p-tau uptake, the intracellular calcium levels rose promptly. Gene expression analyses revealed that p-tau potently triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress-associated apoptosis, and pro-inflammation in cells. Proteomics studies showed that p-tau diminished heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an ER stress-associated anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress regulator, while stimulated the accumulation of MIOS and other proteins. p-Tau-induced ER stress-associated apoptosis and pro-inflammation are ameliorated by apomorphine, a brain-permeable prescription drug widely used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, and by overexpression of HO-1. Our results reveal probable cellular functions targeted by hyperphosphorylated tau. Some of these dysfunctions and stress responses have been linked to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

Methods: We analyzed [18F]PI-2620 PET data from 65 patients with clinical diagnoses associated with AD or FTLD neuropathology; most (60/65) also had amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) PET. Scans were acquired 30-60\u2009min after injection; SUVr maps (reference, inferior cerebellar cortex) were created for the full acquisition and for 10-min truncated sliding windows (30-40, 35-45,\u202650-60\u2009min). Age- and sex-adjusted z score maps were computed for each patient, relative to 23 A\u03b2-negative cognitively healthy controls (HC). Mean SUVr in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nuclei, dentate nuclei, white matter, and temporal gray matter was extracted for the full and truncated windows. Results: Patients with suspected AD neuropathology (A\u03b2-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia) showed high-intensity temporoparietal cortex-predominant [18F]PI-2620 binding. At the group level, patients with clinical diagnoses associated with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome [PSP Richardson syndrome], corticobasal syndrome, and nonfluent-variant primary progressive aphasia) exhibited higher globus pallidus SUVr than did HCs; pallidal retention was highest in the PSP Richardson syndrome group, in whom SUVr was correlated with symptom severity (\u03c1 = 0.53, P = 0.05). At the individual level, only half of PSP Richardson syndrome, corticobasal syndrome, and nonfluent-variant primary progressive aphasia patients had a pallidal SUVr above that of HCs. Temporal SUVr discriminated AD patients from HCs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.83-1.00]) for all time windows, whereas discrimination between patients with PSP Richardson syndrome and HCs using pallidal SUVr was fair regardless of time window (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61-0.92] at 30-40\u2009min vs. 0.81 [95% CI, 0.66-0.96] at 50-60\u2009min; P = 0.67).

Apoptosis occurs when ER stress is prolonged or the adaptive response fails. In healthy young cells, the ratio of protein folding machinery to quantities of misfolded proteins is balanced under normal circumstances. However, the age-related deterioration of the complex systems for handling protein misfolding is accompanied by ageing-related disruption of protein homeostasis, which results in the build-up of misfolded and aggregated proteins. This ultimately results in decreased cell viability and forms the basis of common age-related diseases called protein misfolding diseases.

While the U-fibers play a crucial role in various brain disorders, there is a lack of effective tools to reconstruct their highly curved trajectory from diffusion MRI (dMRI). In this work, we propose a novel surface-based framework for the probabilistic tracking of fibers on the triangular mesh representation of the SWM. By deriving a closed-form solution to transform the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients of 3D fiber orientation distributions (FODs) to local coordinate systems on each triangle, we develop a novel approach to project the FODs onto the tangent space of the SWM. After that, we utilize parallel transport to realize the intrinsic propagation of streamlines on SWM following probabilistically sampled fiber directions. Our intrinsic and surface-based method eliminates the need to perform the necessary but challenging sharp turns in 3D compared with conventional volume-based tractography methods. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we performed quantitative comparisons to demonstrate the proposed algorithm can more effectively reconstruct the U-fibers connecting the precentral and postcentral gyrus than previous methods. Quantitative validations were then performed on post-mortem MRIs to show the reconstructed U-fibers from our method more faithfully follow the SWM than volume-based tractography.

Dysfunction of the neuronal clearance pathway promotes the accumulation of A\u03b2. The plasminogen-activating system (PAS) is controlled by various enzymes like tissue plasminogen activators (tPA). Neuronal tPA enhances the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which cleaves A\u03b2; this function is controlled by many inhibitors of PAS, including a plasminogen-activating inhibitor (PAI-1) and neuroserpin. Therefore, the objective of the present narrative review was to explore the potential role of tPA/neuroserpin in the pathogenesis of AD. PAI-1 activity is increased in AD, which is involved in accumulating A\u03b2. Progressive increase of A\u03b2 level during AD neuropathology is correlated with the over-production of PAI-1 with subsequent reduction of plasmin and tPA activities. Reducing plasmin and tPA activities promote A\u03b2 by reducing A\u03b2 clearance. Neuroserpin plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD as it regulates the expression and accumulation of A\u03b2. Higher expression of neuroserpin inhibits the neuroprotective tPA and the generation of plasmin with subsequent reduction in the clearance of A\u03b2. These observations raise conflicting evidence on whether neuroserpin is neuroprotective or involved in AD progression. Thus, neuroserpin over-expression with subsequent reduction of tPA may propagate AD neuropathology.", "query": "alzheimers"}, "37886145": {"ArticleTitle": "Molecular docking analysis of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease management.", "AbstractText": "Increasing evidence implicates endo-lysosomal dysfunction in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 18 proteins were quantified using a mass spectrometry assay panel in the cerebrospinal fluid of 36 people with the language variant of FTD, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) (including 13 with non-fluent variant (nfvPPA), 11 with semantic variant (svPPA), and 12 with logopenic variant (lvPPA)) and 19 healthy controls.

No restrictions were applied to the language and year of publication. Exposure was PD, and the outcome of interest was the onset and/or progression of AD. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) designed for non-randomized studies. Six studies fulfilling the selection criteria were included in this systematic review. Four of the studies were of cohort design and two were of case-control design. All except one showed a significant association between PD and the risk of AD onset and progression. According to the NOS bias risk assessment, three studies were found to be of good quality, and three other cohort studies were of low quality. Data from this systematic review indicate that patients with PD present a significantly higher risk of AD compared to individuals with healthy periodontium. However, results should be interpreted with caution given the methodological limitations found.

Autophagy is strongly associated with the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are brain-resident macrophages, and recent studies indicate that autophagy in microglia protects neurons from neurodegeneration. Postnatal neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons from adult neural stem cells (NSCs), is impaired in AD patients as well as in AD animal models. However, the extent to which microglial autophagy influences adult NSCs and neurogenesis in AD animal models has not been studied. Here, we showed that conditional knock out (cKO) of Atg5 (autophagy related 5) in microglia inhibited postnatal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, but not in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of a 5\u00d7FAD mouse model. Interestingly, the protection of neurogenesis by Atg5 in microglia was only observed in female AD mice. To confirm the roles of autophagy in microglia for postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, we generated additional cKO mice to delete autophagy essential genes Rb1cc1 or Atg14 in microglia. However, these rb1cc1 cKO and atg14 cKO mice did not exhibit neurogenesis defects in the context of a female AD mouse model. Last, we used the CSF1R antagonist to deplete ATG5-deficient microglia and this intervention restored neurogenesis in the hippocampus of 5\u00d7FAD mice. These results indicate that microglial ATG5 is essential to maintain postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD.

In this study, we employed AUTOTAC to synthesize ATC161, a chimeric compound that adopts Anle138b as target-binding ligand (TBL) for SNCA aggregates. The autophagy-targeting ligand (ATL) of ATC161 was designed to allosterically activate the autophagy receptor SQSTSM1/p62 (sequestosome 1), a key step for targeting SNCA aggregates to the phagophore. The lysosomal degradation of SNCA aggregates by ATC161 acutely occurs at DC50 of 100-500\u2009nM with no significant off-target degradation of monomeric SNCA. ATC161 protects cells from DNA and mitochondrial damage by SNCA aggregates. In PD model mice, oral administration of ATC161 decreases the level of SNCA aggregates and their propagation across brain regions, which mitigates glial inflammatory responses and improves muscle strength and locomotive activity.

Consistent with the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the hippocampus we observe with aging, we find that TIMP2 acts to reduce accumulation of ECM around synapses in the hippocampus. Moreover, its deletion results in hindrance of newborn neuron migration through a denser ECM network. A novel conditional TIMP2 knockout (KO) model reveals that neuronal TIMP2 regulates adult neurogenesis, accumulation of ECM, and ultimately hippocampus-dependent memory.

Further, hesperidin upregulates the autophagy genes in wild-type N2, evident by increased GFP-tagged LGG-1 foci. However, hesperidin failed to upregulate the autophagy genes level in acr-16 mutant worms that suggests autophagy activation is mediated through acr-16. In addition, hesperidin showed antiaging and anti-oxidative effects, as evidenced by positive changes in different markers necessary for health span and lifespan. Additionally, hesperidin could upregulate acr-16 and autophagy genes (lgg-1 & bec-1) and ameliorates A\u03b2-induced toxicity as observed with reduce ROS accumulation, paralysis rate, and enhanced lifespan even in worms AD model CL4176 and CL2006 strain.

Eventually, adding Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib to the enzyme-tau complex significantly increased the number of tau detachments during the 200\u2009ns simulation. We report Bemcentinib and Repotrectinib, formerly prescribed for cancer, as potential inhibitors of the CK1 \u03b4.

Clinical diagnoses primarily rely on a combination of life history information and questionnaires, with a distinct lack of discriminative biomarkers in use for psychiatric disorders. Symptoms across brain conditions are associated with functional alterations of cognitive and emotional processes, which can correlate with anatomical variation; structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the brain are therefore an important focus of research, particularly for predictive modelling. With the advent of large MRI data consortia (such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) facilitating a greater number of MRI-based classification studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-deep learning models well suited to image processing tasks-have become increasingly popular for research into brain conditions. This has resulted in a myriad of studies reporting impressive predictive performances, demonstrating the potential clinical value of deep learning systems. However, methodologies can vary widely across studies, making them difficult to compare and/or reproduce,\u00a0potentially limiting their clinical application.

Proliferation of microglia producing an expanded, reactive population and associated neuroinflammatory alterations have been implicated in the onset and progression of cerebrovascular white matter disease, in patients and in animal models, suggesting that targeting microglial proliferation may exert protection. Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) is a key regulator of microglial proliferation. We found that the expression of CSF1R/Csf1r and other markers indicative of increased microglial abundance are significantly elevated in damaged white matter in human cerebrovascular disease and in a clinically relevant mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular cognitive impairment. Using the mouse model, we investigated long-term pharmacological CSF1R inhibition, via GW2580, and demonstrated that the expansion of microglial numbers in chronic hypoperfused white matter is prevented. Transcriptomic analysis of hypoperfused white matter tissue showed enrichment of microglial and inflammatory gene sets, including phagocytic genes that were the predominant expression modules modified by CSF1R inhibition. Further, CSF1R inhibition attenuated hypoperfusion-induced white matter pathology and rescued spatial learning impairments and to a lesser extent cognitive flexibility. Overall, this work suggests that inhibition of CSF1R and microglial proliferation mediates protection against chronic cerebrovascular white matter pathology and cognitive deficits.

One of the most common symptoms of AD is spatial memory impairment, which occurs in more than 60% of patients. This memory loss is closely related to the impairment of cognitive maps in the brain. The entorhinal grid cells and the hippocampal place cells are important cellular basis for spatial memory and navigation functions in the brain. Understanding the abnormal firing pattern of these neurons and their impaired coordination to neural oscillations in transgenic rodents is crucial for identifying the therapeutic targets for AD. In this article, we review recent studies on neural activity based on transgenic rodent models of AD, with a focus on the changes in the firing characteristics of neurons and the abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.

The pathogenesis of AD is still uncertain and intricate, and helpful therapy has rarely been recorded. So, discovering amyloid modulators is deemed a promising avenue for preventing and treating AD. In this study, human serum albumin (HSA), a protein-based A\u03b2 inhibitor, was utilized as a template to guide the synthesis of HSA-manganese dioxide nanocomposites (HMn NCs) through biomineralization. The in situ formed MnO2 in HSA endows this nano-platform with outstanding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability, including superoxide dismutase-mimetic and catalase-mimetic activities, which could scavenge the plethora of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide. More importantly, the HMn NCs show enhanced potency in suppressing A\u03b2 fibrillization compared with HSA, which further alleviates A\u03b2-mediated SH-SY5Y neurotoxicity by scavenging excessive ROS. Moreover, it is demonstrated that HMn NCs reduce A\u03b2-related inflammation in BV-2 cells by lowering tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6. Furthermore, transgenic C. elegans studies showed that HMn NCs could remove A\u03b2 plaques, reduce ROS in CL2006 worms, and promote the lifespan extension of worms.

Amyloid precursor protein (App) knock-in mouse models recapitulate AD-associated A\u03b2 pathology, allowing elucidation of downstream effects of A\u03b2 accumulation and their temporal appearance upon disease progression. Here we have investigated the sequential onset of AD-like pathologies in AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F knock-in mice by time-course transcriptome analysis of hippocampus, a region severely affected in AD. Strikingly, energy metabolism emerged as one of the most significantly altered pathways already at an early stage of pathology. Functional experiments in isolated mitochondria from hippocampus of both AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F mice confirmed an upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation driven by the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, IV and V, associated with higher susceptibility to oxidative damage and Ca2+-overload. Upon increasing pathologies, the brain shifts to a state of hypometabolism with reduced abundancy of mitochondria in presynaptic terminals. These late-stage mice also displayed enlarged presynaptic areas associated with abnormal accumulation of synaptic vesicles and autophagosomes, the latter ultimately leading to local autophagy impairment in the synapses. In summary, we report that A\u03b2-induced pathways in App knock-in mouse models recapitulate key pathologies observed in AD brain, and our data herein adds a comprehensive understanding of the pathologies including dysregulated metabolism and synapses and their timewise appearance to find new therapeutic approaches for AD.", "query": "alzheimers"}, "37873064": {"ArticleTitle": "OptoProfilin: A Single Component Biosensor of Applied Cellular Stress.", "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Passive immunotherapies using monoclonal antibodies for targeting A\u03b2 have shown promise for AD treatment. Indeed, recent US FDA approval of aducanumab and lecanemab, alongside positive donanemab Phase III results demonstrated clinical efficacy after decades of failed clinical trials for AD. However, the pharmacological basis distinguishing clinically effective from ineffective therapies remains unclear, impeding development of potent therapeutics. This study aimed to provide a quantitative perspective for effectively targeting A\u03b2 with antibodies. We first reviewed the contradicting results associated with amyloid hypothesis and the pharmacological basis of A\u03b2 immunotherapy. Subsequently, we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model that describes the non-linear progression of A\u03b2 pathology and the pharmacologic actions of the A\u03b2-targeting antibodies. Using the QSP model, we analyzed various scenarios for effective passive immunotherapy for AD. The model revealed that binding exclusively to the A\u03b2 monomer has minimal effect on A\u03b2 aggregation and plaque reduction, therefore antibody affinity towards A\u03b2 monomer is unwanted, as it could become a distractive mechanism for plaque reduction. Neither early intervention, high brain penetration, nor increased dose alone could yield significant improvement of clinical efficacy for antibodies targeting solely monomers. Antibodies that bind all A\u03b2 species but lack effector function exhibited moderate effects in plaque reduction. Our model highlights the importance of binding aggregate A\u03b2 species and incorporating effector functions for efficient and early plaque reduction, guiding the development of more effective therapies for this devastating disease. Significance Statement Despite previous unsuccessful attempts spanning several decades, passive immunotherapies utilizing monoclonal antibodies for targeting amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) have demonstrated promise with two recent FDA approvals. However, the pharmacological basis that differentiates clinically effective therapies from ineffective ones remains elusive.

Brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and others are considered neurodegenerative diseases and can be characterized by progressive loss of neurons. The deficiency of insulin, impaired signaling, and its resistance lead to alteration in the neuronal functioning of the brain. Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a significant role in the amyloid \u03b2 metabolism, aggregation, and deposition of misfolded proteins in the brain's hippocampal and cortical neuronal regions. The insulin signaling via IP3 activation upregulates the IDE and could be a promising approach to regulate neurodegeneration. The repurposing of existing antidiabetic drugs such as Metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1), sodium-glucose co-transport-2 (SGCT-2) inhibitors, and insulin could be an alternative and effective strategy to treat neurodegeneration via modulating insulin signaling, insulin resistance, IDE activity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, serum lipid profile and neuroinflammation in the brain.

The purpose of this work was to understand interactions among curcumin, \u03b2-sheet-rich A\u03b2 fibrillar oligomers (FO), and a model anionic membrane.

FO accumulation on the membrane was reduced by \u223c66% in the presence of curcumin, likely influenced by membrane thinning.

Numerous studies have asserted a close association between neuroinflammation and disrupted cerebral energetics. During AD progression and other neurodegenerative disorders, a persistent state of chronic neuroinflammation reportedly exacerbates cytotoxicity and potentiates neuronal death. Here, we assessed the impact of a neuroinflammatory challenge on metabolic demand and microvascular hemodynamics in the somatosensory cortex of an AD mouse model. We utilized in vivo 2-photon microscopy and the phosphorescent oxygen sensor Oxyphor 2P to measure partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and capillary red blood cell flux in cortical microvessels of awake mice. Intravascular pO2 and capillary RBC flux measurements were performed in 8-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and wildtype littermates on days 0, 7, and 14 of a 14-day period of lipopolysaccaride-induced neuroinflammation. Before the induced inflammatory challenge, AD mice demonstrated reduced metabolic demand but similar capillary red blood cell flux as their wild type counterparts. Neuroinflammation provoked significant reductions in cerebral intravascular oxygen levels and elevated oxygen extraction in both animal groups, without significantly altering red blood cell flux in capillaries. This study provides evidence that neuroinflammation alters cerebral oxygen demand at the early stages of AD without substantially altering vascular oxygen supply.

Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for APOE4 (rs429358; \u03b2 : 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.69; p =8.67x10 -25 ) and a genome-wide significant association for ZMIZ1 (rs6480922; \u03b2 : -0.33, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.22; p =1.42x10 -8 ). The increased p-S65-Ub levels in APOE4 -carrier may be mediated by both co-pathology-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which was confirmed in Apoe-targeted replacement mice and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Intriguingly, ZMIZ1 rs6480922 also significantly associated with increased brain weight and reduced neuropathological burden indicating a potential role as a resilience factor. Our findings nominate novel mitophagy regulators in LBD brain ( ZMIZ1 locus) and highlight a strong association of APOE4 with mitophagy alteration.

However, it is not clear whether non-image-forming responses estimation may be biased by having light in sequential blocks, for example, through a potential carryover effect of one light onto the next. We reasoned that pupil light reflex was an easy readout of one of the non-image-forming effects of light that could be used to address this issue. We characterised the sustained pupil light reflex in 13-16 healthy young individuals under short light exposures during three distinct cognitive processes (executive, emotional and attentional). Light conditions pseudo-randomly alternated between monochromatic orange light (0.16 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux) and polychromatic blue-enriched white light of three different levels (37, 92, 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux). As expected, higher melanopic irradiance was associated with larger sustained pupil light reflex in each cognitive domain. This result was stable over the light sequence under higher melanopic irradiance levels compared with lower ones. Exploratory frequency-domain analyses further revealed that sustained pupil light reflex was more variable under lower melanopic irradiance levels. Importantly, sustained pupil light reflex varied across tasks independently of the light condition, pointing to a potential impact of light history and/or cognitive context on sustained pupil light reflex.

It is estimated that one in three elderly people die from AD or other dementias. Chinese herbal medicine as a potential drug for treating AD has gained growing interest from many researchers. Moschus, a rare and valuable traditional Chinese animal medicine, was originally documented in Shennong Ben Cao Jing and recognized for its properties of reviving consciousness/resuscitation. Additionally, Moschus has the efficacy of \"regulation of menstruation with blood activation, relief of swelling and pain\" and is used for treating unconsciousness, stroke, coma, and cerebrovascular diseases. However, it is uncertain whether Moschus has any protective effect on AD patients. We explored whether Moschus could protect glutamate (Glu)-induced PC12 cells from cellular injury and preliminarily explored their related action mechanisms. The chemical compounds of Moschus were analyzed and identified by GC-MS. The Glu-induced differentiated PC12 cell model was thought to be the common AD cellular model. The study aims to preliminarily investigate the intervention effect of Moschus on Glu-induced PC12 cell damage as well as their related action mechanisms. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cell apoptosis, autophagic vacuoles, autolysosomes or autophagosomes, proteins related to apoptosis, and the proteins related to autophagy were examined and analyzed. Seventeen active compounds of the Moschus sample were identified based on GC-MS analysis. In comparison to the control group, Glu stimulation increased cell viability loss, LDH release, mitochondrial damage, loss of MMP, apoptosis rate, and the number of cells containing autophagic vacuoles, and autolysosomes or autophagosomes, while these results were decreased after the pretreatment with Moschus and 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Furthermore, Glu stimulation significantly increased cleaved caspase-3, Beclin1, and LC3II protein expression, and reduced B-cell lymphoma 2/BAX ratio and p62 protein expression, but these results were reversed after pretreatment of Moschus and 3-MA.

This dilemma in question involves the challenge of selecting between a familiar option with a more predictable outcome, and another option whose outcome is uncertain and may yield potentially greater rewards compared to the known option. The aim of this study was to combine experimental procedures and computational modeling to examine whether, in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorders, apathy affects performance in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Through using a four-armed bandit reinforcement-learning task, we showed that apathetic older adults explored more and performed worse than non-apathetic subjects. Moreover, the mental flexibility assessed by the Trail-making test-B was negatively associated with the percentage of exploration. These results suggest that apathy is characterized by an increased explorative behavior and inefficient decision-making, possibly due to weak mental flexibility to switch toward the exploitation of the more rewarding options. Apathetic participants also took longer to make a choice and failed more often to respond in the allotted time, which could reflect the difficulties in action initiation and selection.

Brain-specific targeting of neuregulin-1 by intraventricular delivery of a novel neuregulin-1 fusion protein antagonist GlyB4 significantly alters microglial morphology and function to a non-pathogenic morphology in early-stage 5XFAD mice and prevents plaques from forming. Once plaques have already formed, GlyB4 reduces new plaque formation and prevents synaptic loss. Selective, targeted disruption of neuregulin-1 signaling on brain microglia with GlyB4 could be a novel 'upstream' approach to slow or stop disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.Significance StatementMicroglia-associated neuroinflammation is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we show that neuregulin1 (NRG1), an important neuron-glial signaling factor in development, induces microglial activation and promotes pathological changes in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of NRG1 using a targeted NRG1 antagonist called GlyB4 blocks NRG1 receptor activation in microglia, reduces Amyloid \u03b2 plaque formation, and prevents synaptic loss. While NRG1 clearly has important functions at other sites in the nervous system, excessive NRG1 signaling in microglia leads to pathological neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

Herein, we report that in disease models with overactive mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling (or mTORopathies), deficits in dendritic L-VGCC activity are associated with increased expression of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Parkinsonism-associated deglycase (DJ-1).

So far, dozens of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) have been discovered, and they (members from KDM1 to KDM7 family) are important for neurodevelopment by regulating cellular processes, such as chromatin structure and gene transcription. The role of KDM5C and KDM7B in neural development is particularly important, and mutations in both genes are frequently found in human X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Functional disorders of specific KDMs, such as KDM1A can lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several KDMs can serve as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. At present, the function of KDMs in neurodegenerative diseases is not fully understood, so more comprehensive and profound studies are needed.

This paper presents an integrative approach for constructing and analyzing the functionally-specific network for spatial navigation in the human brain.

We here assessed the effects of ELS on synaptic function and composition in the hippocampus of male mice. Mice were subjected to ELS by housing dams and pups with limited bedding and nesting material from postnatal days (P) 2-9. Synaptic strength was measured in terms of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus at three different developmental stages: the early postnatal phase (P9), preadolescence (P21, at weaning) and adulthood at 3\u2009months of age (3MO). Hippocampal synaptosome fractions were isolated from P9 and 3MO tissue and analyzed for protein content to assess postsynaptic composition. Finally, dendritic spine density was assessed in the DG at 3MO. At P9, ELS increased mEPSC frequency and amplitude. In parallel, synaptic composition was altered as PSD-95, GluA3 and GluN2B content were significantly decreased. The increased mEPSC frequency was sustained up to 3MO, at which age, GluA3 content was significantly increased. No differences were found in dendritic spine density.

However, few mouse models of AD recapitulate the neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system. The p75 neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, has been associated with the degeneration of BFCNs in AD. The senescence-accelerated mouse prone number 8 (SAMP8) is a well-accepted model of accelerated and pathological aging. To gain a better understanding of the role of p75NTR in the basal forebrain during aging, we generated a new mouse line, the SAMP8-p75exonIII-/-. Deletion of p75NTR in the SAMP8 background induces an increase in the number of BFCNs at birth, followed by a rapid decline during aging compared to the C57/BL6 background. This decrease in the number of BFCNs correlates with a worsening in the Y-maze memory test at 6\u2009months in the SAMP8-p75exonIII-/-. We found that SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- and C57/BL6-p75exonIII-/- mice expressed constitutively a short isoform of p75NTR that correlates with an upregulation of the protein levels of SREBP2 and its targets, HMGCR and LDLR, in the BF of both SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- and C57/BL6-p75exonIII-/- mice.

Since the neuronal cytoskeleton is a common downstream pathological target of tau and A\u03b2, which mostly lead to augmented microtubule instability, the administration of microtubule stabilizing agents (MSAs) can protect against their pathological actions. However, the effectiveness of MSAs is still uncertain due to their state-dependent negative effects; thus, evaluating their specific actions in different pathological or physiological conditions is required. We evaluated whether epothilone-D (Epo-D), a clinically used MSA, rescues from the functional and behavioral alterations produced by intracerebroventricular injection of A\u03b2, the presence of P-tau, or their combination in rTg4510 mice. We also explored the side effects of Epo-D. To do so, we evaluated hippocampal-dependent spatial memory with the Hebb-Williams maze, hippocampal CA1 integrity and the intrinsic and synaptic properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons with the patch-clamp technique. A\u03b2 and P-tau mildly impaired memory retrieval, but produced contrasting effects on intrinsic excitability. When A\u03b2 and P-tau were combined, the alterations in excitability and spatial reversal learning (i.e., cognitive flexibility) were exacerbated. Interestingly, Epo-D prevented most of the impairments induced A\u03b2 and P-tau alone and combined. However, Epo-D also exhibited some side effects depending on the prevailing pathological or physiological condition, which should be considered in future preclinical and translational studies.

Previous studies have implicated different autophagy receptors in directing distinct species of MAPT to autophagy, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Here we examine how the autophagy receptors NBR1 and SQSTM1 differentially associate with specific forms of MAPT. In primary neurons depletion of NBR1, unlike depletion of SQSTM1, significantly increased phosphorylated MAPT levels. The specificity of the interactions was confirmed using in vitro binding assays with purified proteins. We provide direct evidence that the co-chaperone BAG3 promotes the preferential association of NBR1 with monomeric MAPT and SQSTM1 with oligomeric MAPT. Using an in vitro affinity-isolation assay, we show that SQSTM1 only binds to monomeric MAPT when BAG3 is absent and fails to bind when BAG3 is present. The opposite is true of NBR1; its association with monomeric MAPT was dependent on the presence of BAG3. Interestingly, in Alzheimer disease brain the association of NBR1 with BAG3 was significantly decreased. In a mouse model, ablation of BAG3 in neural cells disrupted the association of NBR1 with phosphorylated MAPT and led to increased levels of phosphorylated and oligomeric MAPT.

Other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) including frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and psychological disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), and even normal aging all have cytokine-associated reductions in cognitive function. Thus, there is likely commonality between these secondary cognitive deficits and inflammation. Neurological disorders are increasingly associated with substantial neuroinflammation, in which CNS-resident cells secrete cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 and interleukins (ILs) including IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. CNS-resident cells also respond to a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines, which can have both direct effects on neurons by changing the expression of ion channels and perturbing electrical properties, as well as indirect effects through glia-glia and immune-glia cross-talk. There is significant overlap in these cytokine and chemokine expression profiles across diseases, with TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 strongly associated with cognitive deficits in multiple disorders.

Subsequently, the protective effects of A2AR blockade on dendritic morphology and synaptic plasticity of 6-week-old abGCs was investigated using retrovirus infection and electrophysiological recordings.

Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish amyloid from non-amyloid proteins or peptides. While experimental approaches are typically preferred, they are costly and time-consuming. In this study, we have developed a machine learning framework called iAMY-RECMFF to discriminate amyloidgenic from non-amyloidgenic peptides. In our model, we first encoded the peptide sequences using the residue pairwise energy content matrix. We then utilized Pearson's correlation coefficient and distance correlation to extract useful information from this matrix. Additionally, we employed an improved similarity network fusion algorithm to integrate features from different perspectives. The Fisher approach was adopted to select the optimal feature subset. Finally, the selected features were inputted into a support vector machine for identifying amyloidgenic peptides. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the identification of amyloidgenic peptides compared to existing predictors. This suggests that our method may serve as a powerful tool in identifying amyloidgenic peptides.

The MetS constitutes elevated fasting glucose, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension and increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, but the precise mechanism remains elusive. Insulin resistance, which develops from a diet rich in sugars and saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, is shared by the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are also a point of convergence, with altered dynamics in both the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of palmitate- and glucose-induced insulin resistance in the brain and its potential link through EVs to Alzheimer's disease is unknown. We demonstrate that palmitate and high glucose induce insulin resistance and amyloid precursor protein phosphorylation in primary rat embryonic cortical neurons and human cortical stem cells. Palmitate also triggers insulin resistance in oligodendrocytes, the supportive glia of the brain. Palmitate and glucose enhance amyloid precursor protein secretion from cortical neurons via EVs, which induce tau phosphorylation when added to na\u00efve neurons. Additionally, EVs from palmitate-treated oligodendrocytes enhance insulin resistance in recipient neurons.

There is a long history of investigations regarding the inhibition of CETP as a target for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Initially, the potential effect on cardiovascular events of CETP inhibitors was hypothesized to be mediated by their ability to increase HDL cholesterol, but, based on evidence from anacetrapib and the newest CETP inhibitor, obicetrapib, it is now understood to be primarily due to reducing LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Nevertheless, evidence is also mounting that other roles of HDL, including its promotion of cholesterol efflux, as well as its apolipoprotein composition and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-diabetic properties, may play important roles in several diseases beyond cardiovascular disease, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and sepsis. Furthermore, although Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that higher HDL cholesterol is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), excess risk of AMD was absent in all CETP inhibitor randomized controlled trial data comprising over 70,000 patients. In fact, certain HDL subclasses may, in contrast, be beneficial for treating the retinal cholesterol accumulation that occurs with AMD.

Drebrin and formins are key regulators of neuronal actin networks. Neuron-specific drebrin A is highly enriched in dendritic spines (postsynaptic terminals) of mature excitatory neurons. Decreased levels of drebrin in dendritic spines is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and other complex disorders, which calls for better understanding of its regulatory functions. Drebrin A was previously shown to inhibit actin nucleation and bundling by the diaphanous formin-2 (mDia2) - an actin nucleator that is involved in the initiation of dendritic spines. Characterization of the molecular binding interface between mDia2 and drebrin is necessary to better understand the functional consequences of this interaction and its biological relevance. Prior work suggested a multi-pronged interface between mDia2 and drebrin, which involves both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the drebrin molecule. Here we used mass spectrometry analysis, deletion mutagenesis, and an array of synthetic peptides of neuronal drebrin A to map its formin-binding interface. The mDia2-interacting interface on drebrin was narrowed down to three highly conserved 9-16 residue sequences that were used to identify some of the key residues involved in this interaction. Deletion of the C-terminal region of drebrin greatly reduces its binding to mDia2 and the extent of its inhibition of formin-driven actin assembly. Moreover, our experiments with formins from different subfamilies showed that drebrin is a specific rather than general inhibitor of these proteins.

Despite some pan-JNK inhibitors reaching clinical trials, no JNK-targeted therapies have achieved market approval. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a sophisticated virtual screening approach. We begin with an energy-based screening, subsequently integrating a variety of rescoring techniques. These encompass glide docking scores, MM/GBSA, and artificial scoring mechanisms such as DeepDock and advanced Graph Neural Networks. This virtual screening workflow is designed to evaluate and identify potential small-molecule inhibitors with high binding affinity. We have implemented a virtual screening workflow to identify potential candidate molecules. This process has resulted in the selection of ten molecules. Subsequently, these ten molecules have undergone biological activity evaluation to assess their potential efficacy. Impressively, molecule compound 6 surfaced as the most promising, exhibiting a potent kinase inhibitory activity marked by an IC50 of 130.1 nM and a notable reduction in TNF-\u03b1 release within macrophages. This suggests that compound 6 could potentially serve as an effective inhibitor for the treatment of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. The prospect of further medicinal modifications to optimize compound 6 presents a promising avenue for future research and development in this field. Utilizing binding pose metadynamics coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, we delved into the explicit binding mode of compound 6 to JNK3. Such insights pave the way for refined drug development strategies.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential ameliorative effects of dapagliflozin and/or hesperidin on Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in rats. In a rodent model of AD, the effect of dapagliflozin with or without hesperidin on the biochemical parameters and the behavioral tests as well as the histopathological parameters was determined. Each of dapagliflozin and hesperidin restored the behavioral tests to the reference values, augmented the antioxidant defense mechanisms, ameliorated the neuronal inflammatory responses, combatted the changes in Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)/High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein signaling and receptors of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) levels, and restored the balance between the apoptotic signals and autophagy in the hippocampal tissues. Additionally, both agents exhibited an outstanding ability to combat LPS-induced perturbations in the histopathological and electron microscopic image of the brain tissues. These favorable effects were significantly encountered in the group treated with dapagliflozin/hesperidin combination when compared versus animals treated with either dapagliflozin or hesperidin.

In the last few decades, compelling evidence has revealed that glial cells are far more active and complex than previously thought. In particular, astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell population, not only take part in brain development, metabolism, and defense against pathogens and insults, but they also affect sensory, motor, and cognitive functions by constantly modulating synaptic activity. Not surprisingly, astrocytes are actively involved in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and other neurological disorders like brain tumors, in which they rapidly become reactive and mediate neuroinflammation. Reactive astrocytes acquire or lose specific functions that differently modulate disease progression and symptoms, including cognitive impairments. Astrocytes express several types of ion channels, including K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRP), aquaporins, mechanoreceptors, and anion channels, whose properties and functions are only partially understood, particularly in small processes that contact synapses. In addition, astrocytes express ionotropic receptors for several neurotransmitters.

On the basis that trophoblast-derived factors modulate endothelial and immune cell profiles in normal pregnancy and the scarce presence of Pg in placenta, we hypothesized that OMVs from Pg affect trophoblast cell phenotype, impairing trophoblast-endothelium and trophoblast-neutrophil interactions. By means of in vitro designs with first-trimester human trophoblast cells, endothelial cells, and freshly isolated neutrophils, we showed that Pg OMVs are internalized by trophoblast cells and modulate the activity and expression of functional markers. Trophoblast cells primed with Pg OMVs enhanced neutrophil chemoattraction and lost their anti-inflammatory effect. In addition, reduced migration with enhanced adhesion of monocytes was found in endothelial cells upon incubation with the media from trophoblast cells pretreated with Pg OMVs.

It is implicated in lactate release and the regulation of glycolytic flux. Whether its expression varies during normal and/or pathological aging is unclear. As the presence of its mature transcript in the brain of young and old mice was determined, an unexpectedly longer RT-PCR fragment was detected in the mouse frontal cortex and hippocampus at 12 vs. 3 months of age. Cultured astrocytes expressed the expected 516 base pair (bp) fragment but treatment with IL-1\u03b2 to mimic inflammation as can occur during aging led to the additional expression of a 928 bp fragment like that seen in aged mice. In contrast, cultured pericytes (a component of the blood-brain barrier) only exhibited the 516 bp fragment. Intriguingly, cultured endothelial cells constitutively expressed both fragments. When RT-PCR was performed on brain subregions of an Alzheimer mouse model (APPswePS1dE9), no fragment was detected at 3 months, while only the 928 bp fragment was present at 12 months. Sequencing of MCT4 RT-PCR products revealed the presence of a remaining intron between exon 2 and 3, giving rise to the longer fragment detected by RT-PCR. These results unravel the existence of intron retention for the MCT4 gene in the central nervous system.

Numerous risk factors for the disease have been identified and our understanding of gene-environment interactions have shed light on several gene variants that contribute to the most common, sporadic form of AD. Microglial cells, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), have long been established as guardians of the brain by providing neuroprotection and maintaining cellular homeostasis. A protein with a myriad of effects on various important signaling pathways that is expressed in microglia is the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing Inositol 5' Phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) protein. Encoded by the INPP5D (Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase D) gene, SHIP1 has diminutive effects on most microglia signaling processes. Polymorphisms of the INPP5D gene have been found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of AD. Several studies have elucidated mechanistic processes by which SHIP1 exerts its perturbations on signaling processes in peripheral immune cells. However, current knowledge of the controllers of INPP5D/SHIP1 expression and the idiosyncrasies of its influences on signaling processes in microglia and their relevance to AD pathophysiology is limited.

The remaining two clusters included (i) coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction; and (ii) hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The multimer detection system (MDS) screening test for plasma for amyloid oligomers was also positive, which supported the AD diagnosis. It was verified that PSEN1 Glu318Gly itself may not impact amyloid production. However, additional variants were found in other AD and non-AD risk genes, as follows: SORL1 Glu270Lys was suggested as a risk mutation for AD and could increase amyloid peptide production and impair endosome functions.

Treatment of HMC3 cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHChol) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHChol) led to increased IL-1\u03b2 expression at the transcript and protein levels.

Behavioral experiments are frequently conducted using this model; however, the effect size has not yet been reported. In this study, we examined basic cognition and locomotion in 5XFAD mice with a C57BL6/J background (5XFAD-J) at 6 months of age, a period in which impairments of cognitive function and locomotion are commonly observed. We analyzed the effect sizes of cognitive and locomotive experiments in the 5XFAD mice compared with those in the wild-type mice.

Statistical analyses, adjusting for sex, age, and education, employed multivariate general linear models to probe differences among these groups. Results: Results showed that AD patients exhibited poorer performance in switching in both VF tasks and SVF clustering compared to NC. Similarly, the aMCI group performed worse than the NC in switching and clustering in both tasks, with aMCI performing similarly to AD, except for SVF switching. In contrast, the naMCI subgroup performed similarly to those with NC across most strategies, surpassing AD patients. Notably, the aMCI subgroup's poor performance in SVF switching was mainly due to the subpar performance of the multi-domain aMCI subgroup. This subgroup was outperformed in switching in both VF tasks by the single-domain naMCI, who also performed better than the multi-domain naMCI in SVF switching. No significant differences emerged in terms of perseverations and intrusions. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest a continuum of declining switching ability in the SVF task, with NC surpassing both aMCI and AD, and aMCI outperforming those with AD.

To uncover biomarkers, deep learning techniques have quickly emerged as a crucial methodology. A functional molecular imaging technique known as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) has been shown to be effective in assisting researchers in understanding the morphological and neurological alterations to the brain associated with AD. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also long dominated the field of AD progression and have been the subject of substantial research, while more recent approaches like vision transformers (ViT) have not yet been fully investigated.

Neuroimaging has shown great promise, including the amyloid-PET, which measures the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain-a hallmark of AD. It is desirable to train end-to-end deep learning models to predict the progression of AD for individuals at early stages based on 3D amyloid-PET. However, commonly used models are trained in a fully supervised learning manner, and they are inevitably biased toward the given label information. To this end, we propose a selfsupervised contrastive learning method to accurately predict the conversion to AD for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with 3D amyloid-PET. The proposed method, SMoCo, uses both labeled and unlabeled data to capture general semantic representations underlying the images. As the downstream task is given as classification of converters vs. non-converters, unlike the general self-supervised learning problem that aims to generate task-agnostic representations, SMoCo additionally utilizes the label information in the pre-training. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The results confirmed that the proposed method is capable of providing appropriate data representations, resulting in accurate classification. SMoCo showed the best classification performance over the existing methods, with AUROC = 85.17%, accuracy = 81.09%, sensitivity = 77.39%, and specificity = 82.17%. While SSL has demonstrated great success in other application domains of computer vision, this study provided the initial investigation of using a proposed self-supervised contrastive learning model, SMoCo, to effectively predict MCI conversion to AD based on 3D amyloid-PET.", "query": "cancer"}, "37940695": {"ArticleTitle": "Author Correction: Regulation of hnRNPA1 by microRNAs controls the miR-18a-K-RAS axis in chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide.

Using a Cox regression model, we investigated the impact of the quartile of total cholesterol (TC) levels on incident dementia, adjusting for age, sex, education, neuropsychiatric symptoms, neuropsychological assessments, HRT, as well as various vascular risk factors and medications. We examined a cohort of 787 participants, comprising 539 (68.5%) individuals who did not develop dementia (non-converters). Among these non-converters, 68 individuals (12.6%) were treated with HRT.

Consumption of berry fruits, including strawberries, has been shown to influence metabolism as well as cognitive performance suggesting potential to mitigate risk for dementia. In this controlled trial, we enrolled overweight middle-aged men and women with insulin resistance and subjective cognitive decline and performed a 12-week intervention with daily administration of whole-fruit strawberry powder.

A substantial comorbidity of concern in COPD patients that is often overlooked in COPD management is cognitive impairment. The exact pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in COPD patients remains a mystery; however, hypoxia, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and cerebral manifestations of these conditions are believed to play crucial roles.

In this Review, we aim to discuss the impact of cognitive impairment in COPD management and the potential mechanisms associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment in COPD patients. The promising roles of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c9-3 PUFAs) in improving cognitive deficits in COPD patients are also discussed. Interestingly, \u03c9-3 PUFAs can potentially enhance the cognitive impairment symptomatology associated with COPD because they can modulate inflammatory processes, activate the antioxidant defence system, and promote amyloid-beta clearance from the brain.

Glutamatergic signaling within neurons and astrocytes of the CA1 region of the hippocampus is critical in cognitive processes, and previous work has indicated deficiencies in this signaling in a mouse model of AD. In this study, we investigated glutamate-mediated signaling by evaluating AMPA-mediated calcium rises in female and male CA1 neurons and astrocytes in a mouse model of AD and examined the potential of decanoic acid to normalize this signaling. In brain slices from 5xFAD mice in which there are five mutations leading to increasing levels of A\u03b242, AMPA-mediated calcium transients in CA1 neurons and astrocytes were significantly lower than that seen in wildtype controls in both females and males. Interestingly, incubation of 5xFAD slices in decanoic acid restored AMPA-mediated calcium levels in neurons and astrocytes in both females and males to levels indistinguishable from those seen in wildtype, whereas similar exposure to decanoic acid did not result in changes in AMPA-mediated transients in neurons or astrocytes in either sex in the wildtype.

Simultaneously, the liver section displayed features of cirrhosis, including an effaced lobular architecture and the extravasation of red blood cells. Liver enzymes ALT, AST and ALP were consistently elevated with disease progression. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the diseased brain. The positive expression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 3-Alpha (HIF3A) in the brain indicated hypoxic conditions, which is consistent with other LOAD studies. This model also exhibited damaged intestinal villi and excessive bowel and urinary incontinence, indicating malnutrition and a disturbed gut microbiome, which is also consistent with LOAD patients. Bioinformatics analysis on serum protein suggests a few affected molecular pathways, like the amyloid secretase pathway, androgen/oestrogen/progesterone biosynthesis, the apoptosis signalling pathway, the insulin/IGF pathway-protein kinase B signalling cascade, the Metabotropic glutamate receptor group I pathway, the Wnt signalling pathway, etc. Behavioural analysis confirmed memory decline and the loss of muscle strength with disease progression. Overall, this rat model of LOAD sheds valuable light on LOAD pathology and highlights the potential link between liver dysfunction, particularly induced by the excessive consumption of junk food, and LOAD.

These disorders primarily encompass ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, and other CNS conditions. Despite substantial progress in understanding and treating the underlying pathological processes in various neurological diseases, there is still a notable absence of effective therapeutic approaches aimed specifically at mitigating the damage caused by these illnesses. Remarkably, ischemia causes severe damage to cells in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. Cerebral ischemia initiates oxygen and glucose deprivation, which subsequently promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, mitophagy dysfunction, and excessive mitochondrial fission, triggering various forms of cell death such as autophagy, apoptosis, as well as ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, a novel type of regulated cell death (RCD), is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis both play critical roles in the pathogenic progression of ischemia-associated CNS diseases. In recent years, growing evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction interplays with ferroptosis to aggravate cerebral ischemia injury. However, the potential connections between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in cerebral ischemia have not yet been clarified. Thus, we analyzed the underlying mechanism between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. We also discovered that GSH depletion and GPX4 inactivation cause lipoxygenase activation and calcium influx following cerebral ischemia injury, resulting in MPTP opening and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, dysfunction in mitochondrial electron transport and an imbalanced fusion-to-fission ratio can lead to the accumulation of ROS and iron overload, which further contribute to the occurrence of ferroptosis. This creates a vicious cycle that continuously worsens cerebral ischemia injury. In this study, our focus is on exploring the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis, which may offer new insights into potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ischemia-associated CNS diseases.", "query": "cancer"}, "37940482": {"ArticleTitle": "Predictive value of the G8 screening tool for postoperative complications in older adults undergoing cancer surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "AbstractText": "The pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is particularly complicated, and early diagnosis and course monitoring of the disease are not ideal based on the available core biomarkers.

A total of 17 eligible and relevant studies involving 1811 subjects, including 949 AD patients and 862 HCs, were included. The results showed that YKL-40 levels in the peripheral blood of AD patients and HCs did not possess significant differences. Subgroup analysis showed YKL-40 significantly differed in plasma (SMD = 0.527, 95%CI: [0.302, 0.752]; p = 0.000), but did not in serum. In the case of comparison with HCs, YKL-40 was significantly higher in CSF of AD patients (SMD = 0.893, 95%CI: [0.665, 1.121]; p = 0.000).

YKL-40 provides support and rationale for the neuroinflammatory pathogenesis of AD. The significance of CSF levels of YKL-40 for early screening of AD is definite.

Cerebrovascular changes are common neuropathologic findings in aged subjects with dementia. Cerebrovascular integrity is critical for proper metabolism and perfusion of the brain, as cerebrovascular remodeling may render the brain more susceptible to pulse pressure and may be associated with poorer cognitive performance and greater risk of cerebrovascular events. The objective of this study is to provide understanding of cerebrovascular remodeling with AD progression. Anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) from a total of 19 brain donor participants from controls and pathologically diagnosed AD groups (early-Braak stages I-II; intermediate-Braak stages III-IV; and advanced-Braak stages V-VI) were included in this study. Mechanical testing, histology, advanced optical imaging, and mass spectrometry were performed to study the progressive structural and functional changes of ACAs with AD progression. Biaxial extension-inflation tests showed that ACAs became progressively less compliant, and the longitudinal stress in the intermediate and advanced AD groups was significantly higher than that from the control group. With pathological AD development, the inner and outer diameters of the\u00a0ACAs remained almost unchanged; however, histology study revealed progressive smooth muscle cell atrophy and loss of elastic fibers which led to compromised structural integrity of the arterial wall.

To study whether the TSPO ligand XBD173 may exert early neuroprotective effects in AD pathology we investigated the impact of XBD173 on amyloid toxicity and neuroplasticity in mouse models of AD. We show that XBD173 (emapunil), via neurosteroid-mediated signaling and delta subunit-containing GABAA receptors, prevents the neurotoxic effect of A\u03b2 on long-term potentiation (CA1-LTP) in the hippocampus and prevents the loss of spines.

However, once AD develops, ApoE4 non-carriers may experience greater benefits compared to ApoE4 carriers, although the overall effectiveness of DHA supplementation at this stage is limited. Potential mechanisms underlying these differential effects may include accelerated DHA catabolism in ApoE4 carriers, impaired transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and compromised lipidation and circulatory function in ApoE4 carriers.

Inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregation by polyphenols is one of the major therapeutic strategies for AD. Among them, four polyphenols (brazilin, resveratrol, hematoxylin, and rosmarinic acid) have been reported to be effective at inhibiting A\u03b2 aggregation, but the inhibition mechanisms are still unclear. In this work, these four polyphenols were selected to explore their interactions with the A\u03b217-42 pentamer by molecular dynamics simulation. All four polyphenols can bind to the pentamer tightly but prefer different binding sites. Conversion of the \u03b2-sheet to the random coil, fewer interchain hydrogen bonds, and weaker salt bridges were observed after binding. Interestingly, different A\u03b217-42 pentamer destabilizing mechanisms for resveratrol and hematoxylin were found. Resveratrol inserts into the hydrophobic core of the pentamer by forming hydrogen bonds with Asp23 and Lys28, while hematoxylin prefers to bind beside chain A of the pentamer, which leads to \u03b2-sheet offset and dissociation of the \u03b21 sheet of chain E.

However, effectively handling heterogeneous data sources and overcoming the challenges posed by multiscale transform methods remains a significant hurdle. This article proposes a novel approach to address these challenges. To harness the power of diverse neuroimaging data, we employ a strategy that leverages optimized convolution techniques. These optimizations include varying kernel sizes and the incorporation of instance normalization, both of which play crucial roles in feature extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Specifically, varying kernel sizes allow us to adapt the receptive field to different image characteristics, enhancing the model's ability to capture relevant information. Furthermore, we employ transposed convolution, which increases spatial resolution of feature maps, and it is optimized with varying kernel sizes and instance normalization. This heightened resolution facilitates the alignment and integration of data from disparate MRI and PET data. The use of larger kernels and strides in transposed convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to capture essential cross-modal relationships. Instance normalization, applied to each modality during the fusion process, mitigates potential biases stemming from differences in intensity, contrast, or scale between modalities. This enhancement contributes to improved model performance by reducing complexity and ensuring robust fusion. The performance of the proposed fusion method is assessed on three distinct neuroimaging datasets, which include: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD, and Early Mild Cognitive); Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, Mild Dementia, Very Mild Dementia); and whole-brain atlas neuroimaging (AANLIB) (consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD). To evaluate the quality of the fused images generated via our method, we employ a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM), which assesses the structural similarity between two images; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which measures how closely the generated image resembles the ground truth; Entropy (E), which assesses the amount of information preserved or lost during fusion; the Feature Similarity Indexing Method (FSIM), which assesses the structural and feature similarities between two images; and Edge-Based Similarity (EBS), which measures the similarity of edges between the fused and ground truth images. The obtained fused image is further evaluated using a Mobile Vision Transformer.

It was hypothesized that individuals with EOMCI will preserve their cognitive functions to a greater extent as compared to individuals with LOMCI, even after adjusting the cognitive performance for age and education through the use of published Greek norms. The level of cognitive decline concerning MOMCI was evaluated for extracting more precise conclusions regarding the impact of the age of onset on the patterns of MCI symptomatology. The analyses of data were conducted in a Greek population of individuals with MCI, who were consecutive visitors of the Outpatient Memory Clinic of Nestor Alzheimer's Centre in Athens, Greece. The sample consisted of 297 participants who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: MCI diagnosis based on Petersen's criteria, Greek mother language, and absence of a psychiatric history or chronic and incurable organic disease. The overall results support the presence of a cognitive advantage of the EOMCI group compared to the LOMCI group. In the MOMCI group, cognitive performance displayed a tendency to remain intermediate compared to the other two groups. Nonetheless, significant differences were observed when this group was compared with the LOMCI group.

Therefore, phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) \u03b13, the most virulent protein secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, has attracted much attention. In this work, the effect of PSM\u03b13 with a unique cross-\u03b1 fibril architecture on the aggregation of pathogenic A\u03b240 of AD was studied by extensive biophysical characterizations. The results proposed that the PSM\u03b13 monomer inhibited the aggregation of A\u03b240 in a concentration-dependent manner and changed the aggregation pathway to form granular aggregates. However, PSM\u03b13 oligomers promoted the generation of the \u03b2-sheet structure, thus shortening the lag phase of A\u03b240 aggregation. Moreover, the higher the cross-\u03b1 content of PSM\u03b13, the stronger the effect of the promotion, indicating that the cross-\u03b1 structure of PSM\u03b13 plays a crucial role in the aggregation of A\u03b240. Further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that the Met1-Gly20 region in the PSM\u03b13 monomer can be combined with the Asp1-Ala2 and His13-Val36 regions in the A\u03b240 monomer by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, which prevents the conformational conversion of A\u03b240 from the \u03b1-helix to \u03b2-sheet structure. By contrast, PSM\u03b13 oligomers mainly combined with the central hydrophobic core (CHC) and the C-terminal region of the A\u03b240 monomer by weak H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, which could not inhibit the transition to the \u03b2-sheet structure in the aggregation pathway. Thus, the research has unraveled molecular interactions between A\u03b240 and PSM\u03b13 of different structures and provided a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between bacterial amyloids and AD-related pathogenic A\u03b2.", "query": "cancer"}, "37939920": {"ArticleTitle": "Evaluating the Safe Zone for Lumbar Pedicle Screws: Are Midline Crossing Screws Indicative of Pedicle Breach?", "AbstractText": "This pilot study aims to explore the potential of a positive psychology intervention (PPI) in enhancing the subjective well-being of older individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia.", "query": "cancer"}, "37939914": {"ArticleTitle": "Development of lymph node metastasis-related prognostic markers in breast cancer.", "AbstractText": "A randomized trial was conducted, initially recruiting 51 participants aged 65 and above from the Greek Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders in Thessaloniki, Greece.

In particular, the interplay facilitated by TNTs among various cell types within the brain, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, glial cells, and microglia, can be essential for the normal development and optimal functioning of this complex organ.

We identified patterns of protein expression and phosphorylation that are modulated in 5xFAD mice and examined the sex-specific impact of DUSP4 overexpression on the 5xFAD proteome/phosphoproteome. In 5xFAD mice, a substantial number of proteins were up- or down-regulated in both male and female mice in comparison to age and sex-matched WT mice, many of which are involved in AD-related biological processes, such as the activated immune response or suppression of synaptic activities. Upon DUSP4 overexpression, significantly regulated proteins were found in pathways that were suppressed, such as the immune response, in male 5xFAD mice. In contrast, such a shift was absent in female mice. For the phosphoproteome, we detected an array of phosphorylation sites that are regulated in 5xFAD compared to WT, and are modulated by DUSP4 overexpression in each sex. Interestingly, the changes in 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation occurred in opposite directions. Strikingly, both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation changes were found for the most part in neurons, and play key roles in neuronal processes and synaptic function. Site-centric pathway analysis revealed that both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation sites were enriched for a number of kinase sets in female, but only a limited number of sets of kinases in male mice. Taken together, our results suggest that male and female 5xFAD mice respond to DUSP4 overexpression via shared and sex-specific molecular mechanisms, which might underly similar reductions in amyloid pathology in both sexes, while learning deficits were reduced in only females with DUSP4 overexpression.

We identified a novel VUS in ANXA11 (P93S) in a kindred with corticobasal syndrome and unique radiographic features that segregated with disease. We then queried neurodegenerative disorder clinic databases to identify the phenotypic spread of ANXA11 mutations. Multi-modal computational analysis of this variant was performed and the effect of this VUS on ANXA11 function and TDP-43 biology was characterized in iPSC-derived neurons. Single-cell sequencing and proteomic analysis of iPSC-derived neurons and microglia were used to determine the multiomic signature of this VUS. Mutations in ANXA11 were found in association with clinically diagnosed corticobasal syndrome, thereby establishing corticobasal syndrome as part of ANXA11 clinical spectrum. In iPSC-derived neurons expressing mutant ANXA11, we found decreased colocalization of lysosomes and decreased neuritic RNA as well as decreased nuclear TDP-43 and increased formation of cryptic exons compared to controls. Multiomic assessment of the P93S variant in iPSC-derived neurons and microglia indicates that the pathogenic omic signature in neurons is modest compared to microglia. Additionally, omic studies reveal that immune dysregulation and interferon signaling pathways in microglia are central to disease. Collectively, these findings identify a new pathogenic variant in ANXA11, expand the range of clinical syndromes caused by ANXA11 mutations, and implicate both neuronal and microglia dysfunction in ANXA11 pathophysiology.

This methodological commentary will correlate recent studies demonstrating the ability of sound waves to carry mass, how the EPIC technique spinal procedure uses a sound wave impulse to create measurable changes in spinal alignment, and the clinical safety and efficacy of this approach. The EPIC technique is a direct genealogical descendant of the technique originally developed by the founding family of chiropractic. With sound wave therapies currently being used to break up kidney stones, called lithotripsy, in physical therapy for the treatment of soft tissue injuries, in the treatment of prostate cancer, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, it is possible that the use of sound wave therapies may enter into the realm of altering joint biomechanics. Through a neurovascular examination, the EPIC technique spinal procedure can ascertain the presence of craniocervical subluxation, followed by acquiring multi-dimensional radiographic images for structural analysis. Currently using digital radiographic analysis, the EPIC technique acquires an epigenetic profile of structural asymmetries as well as a multi-directional biomechanical malposition profile of the spine, combining both profiles to ascertain the exact degrees for realignment. EPIC clinics have successfully utilized EPIC on over 20,000 cases. Comparison of pre-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra around the Z-axis measured on digital radiographs, and post-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra measured on digital radiographs immediately following the procedure, demonstrated an average 52% reduction in lateral biomechanical displacement around the Z-axis in a select group of over 2,000 cases.

In addition to glucose supplied from the blood, brain oxidative metabolism can use local glycogen stores (within astrocytes) as a fuel source via conversion to lactate; both lactate and glycogen have been shown to be important contributors to regulation of cognitive metabolism. Insulin has been shown to be a key regulator of hippocampal cognitive and metabolic processes; in the periphery, insulin facilitates glycogen synthesis and storage, but the impact on brain glycogen is unclear. Furthermore, the impact of diet-induced diabetes on hippocampal glycogen levels and/or metabolism is unknown.

Progerin, a truncated protein resulting from specific lamin A mutations, causes Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a disease that prematurely ages individuals.

In this study, we investigated the effects of exogenous progerin expression on neural progenitor cells carrying familial AD mutations (FAD). Within three to four weeks of differentiation, these cells exhibited robust AD phenotypes, including increased tau phosphorylation, amyloid plaque accumulation, and an elevated A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 ratio.

The origin of synaptic A\u03b2 aggregates remains elusive, but loss of endosomal proteostasis may trigger their formation.In this study we identified the synaptic compartments where A\u03b2 accumulates and performed a longitudinal analysis of synaptosomes isolated from brains of TgCRND8 APP transgenic mice of either sex. To evaluate the specific contribution of A\u03b2-degrading protease endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1) to synaptic/endosomal A\u03b2 homeostasis, we analyzed the effect of partial Ece1 knockout in brain and complete ECE1 knockout in SH-SY5Y cells. Global inhibition of ECE family members was used to further assess their role in preventing synaptic A\u03b2 accumulation.Results showed that, before extracellular amyloid deposition, synapses were burdened with detergent-soluble A\u03b2 monomers, oligomers, and fibrils. Levels of all soluble A\u03b2 species declined thereafter, as A\u03b242 turned progressively insoluble and accumulated in A\u03b2-producing synaptic endosomal vesicles with characteristics of multivesicular bodies. Accordingly, fibrillar A\u03b2 was detected in brain exosomes. ECE-1 deficient mice had significantly increased endogenous synaptosomal A\u03b242 levels and protease inhibitor experiments showed that in TgCRND8 mice, synaptic A\u03b242 became nearly resistant to degradation by ECE-related proteases.Our study supports that A\u03b2 accumulating in synapses is produced locally, within endosomes, and does not require the presence of amyloid plaques. ECE-1 is a determinant factor controlling the accumulation and fibrillization of nascent A\u03b2 in endosomes and, in TgCRND8 mice, A\u03b2 overproduction causes rapid loss of A\u03b242 solubility that curtails ECE-mediated degradation.Significance StatementDeposition of aggregated A\u03b2 in extracellular plaques is a defining feature of AD. A\u03b2 aggregates also accumulate in synapses and may contribute to the profound synaptic loss and cognitive dysfunction typical of the disease. However, it is not clear whether synaptotoxic A\u03b2 is mainly derived from plaques or if it is produced and aggregated locally, within affected synaptic compartments. Filling this knowledge gap is important for the development of an effective treatment for AD, as extracellular and intrasynaptic pools of A\u03b2 may not be equally modulated by immunotherapies or other therapeutic approaches. In this manuscript we provide evidence that A\u03b2 aggregates building up in synapses are formed locally, within synaptic endosomes, due to disruptions in nascent A\u03b2 proteostasis.", "query": "cancer"}, "37939508": {"ArticleTitle": "Assessing the effectiveness of fluorinated and \u03b1-methylated 3-boronophenylalanine for improved tumor-specific boron delivery in boron neutron capture therapy.", "AbstractText": "We have developed a zebrafish model to explore the alterations in neurobehaviors resulting from both acute and chronic exposure to chromium (Cr).

Furthermore, zebrafish exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of Cr (EC group: 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L) for an extended period of 9\u00a0weeks exhibited behaviors comparable to those observed in the HC group. Moreover, the study investigated the neuroprotective effects of donepezil (Don), galantamine (Gal) and resveratrol (Res) drugs in response to neurobehavioral impairments induced by Cr (VI) exposure in zebrafish. Don and Res effectively protect the zebrafish from Cr (VI)-induced anxiety, and memory impairment. Furthermore, Cr (VI) exposure induced heightened oxidative stress while simultaneously diminishing antioxidant enzyme levels. Remarkably, these effects were counteracted in the drug-treated groups. Likewise, exposure to Cr (VI) led to an increase in the expression of genes linked to AD and neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, drug treatment reversed this effect in Cr (VI)-exposed fish.

The SARS-CoV-2-derived protein Orf9b inhibited MARK4-mediated tau phosphorylation in primary neurons and Drosophila. Orf9b inhibited MARK4 activity in an allosteric manner and did not inhibit the activity of MARK2, which is another MARK family member and is closely related to MARK4. Co-expression of Orf9b in the fly retina expressing human tau and MARK4 suppressed phosphorylation of tau at the microtubule-binding repeats and tau-induced neurodegeneration. We identified the minimal sequence of Orf9b required to suppress MARK4 activity and fused it to a cell-permeable sequence (TAT-Orf9b10-18_78-95). Extracellular supplementation of TAT-Orf9b10-18_78-95 inhibited MARK4 activity in primary neurons, and feeding TAT-Orf9b10-18_78-95 to a fly model of tauopathy lowered phospho-tau levels and suppressed neurodegeneration.

Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus structures is challenging due to the small volume, complex shape, low contrast and discontinuous boundaries of hippocampus. Although some methods have been developed for the hippocampus segmentation, most of them paid too much attention to the hippocampus shape and volume instead of considering the spatial information. Additionally, the extracted features are independent of each other, ignoring the correlation between the global and local information. In view of this, here we proposed a novel cross-layer dual Encoding-Shared Decoding network framework with Spatial self-Attention mechanism (called ESDSA) for hippocampus segmentation in human brains. Considering that the hippocampus is a relatively small part in MRI, we introduced the spatial self-attention mechanism in ESDSA to capture the spatial information of hippocampus for improving the segmentation accuracy. We also designed a cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network to effectively extract the global information of MRIs and the spatial information of hippocampus. The spatial features of hippocampus and the features extracted from the MRIs were combined to realize the hippocampus segmentation. Results on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data show that the performance of our ESDSA is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, and the dice similarity coefficient of ESDSA achieves 89.37%. In addition, the dice similarity coefficient of the Spatial Self-Attention mechanism (SSA) strategy and the dual Encoding-Shared Decoding (ESD) strategy is 9.47%, 5.35% higher than that of the baseline U-net, respectively, indicating that the strategies of SSA and ESD can effectively enhance the segmentation accuracy of human brain hippocampus.", "query": "cancer"}, "37939480": {"ArticleTitle": "Plan robustness and RBE influence for proton dose painting by numbers for head and neck cancers.", "AbstractText": "\u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) is a presynaptic protein that is involved in Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases and binds to negatively charged phospholipids.

Hederagenin is a triterpenoid saponin, exerting anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoral, and neuroprotective activities. However, its role in AD progression is still obscure. The aim of this study was to explore the influences of hederagenin on A\u03b2-caused neuronal injury in vitro. Neuronal cells were treated with A\u03b225-35 (A\u03b2) to establish a cellular model of AD. Cell viability was assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Oxidative stress was evaluated by detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Apoptosis was investigated using TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity assays. Protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 1 (PTPN1) was screened by bioinformatics analysis. Protein levels of PTPN1 and protein kinase B (Akt) were measured by western blotting. Hederagenin (2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM) alone did not affect viability of neuronal cells, but relieved A\u03b2-induced viability reduction. Hederagenin mitigated A\u03b2-induced increase in ROS accumulation and decrease in SOD activity. Hederagenin attenuated A\u03b2-induced increase in apoptotic rate and caspase-3 activity. PTPN1 was screened as a target of hederagenin against AD by bioinformatics analysis. Hederagenin treatment resisted A\u03b2-induced decrease in PTPN1 mRNA and protein levels in neuronal cells. PTPN1 silencing attenuated the suppressive functions of hederagenin in A\u03b2-stimulated oxidative stress and apoptosis. Hederagenin mitigated A\u03b2-induced Akt signaling inactivation by upregulating PTPN1 expression. In conclusion, hederagenin attenuates oxidative stress and apoptosis in neuronal cells stimulated with A\u03b2 by promoting PTPN1/Akt signaling activation.", "query": "cancer"}, "37939410": {"ArticleTitle": "Structure and activity relationship analysis of xanthones from mangosteen: Identifying garcinone E as a potent dual EGFR and VEGFR2 inhibitor.", "AbstractText": "Accurate disease risk prediction is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine.

Pirh2 protein abundance was significantly increased during Streptozotocin (STZ) induced AD conditions, and transient silencing of Pirh2 significantly inhibited the A\u03b2 aggregation and modified the dendrite morphology along with the substantial decrease in choline level in the differentiated neurons. MALDI-TOF/TOF, coimmunoprecipitation, and UbcH7-linked in vitro ubiquitylation analysis confirmed the high interaction of Pirh2 with chaperone GRP78. Furthermore, Pirh2 silencing inhibits the STZ induced altered level of endoplasmic reticulum stress and intracellular Ca2+ levels in neuronal N2a cells. Pirh2 silencing also inhibited the AD conditions related to the altered protein abundance of HSP90 and its co-chaperones which may collectively involve in the reduced burden of amyloid aggregates in neuronal cells. Pirh2 silencing further stabilized the nuclear translocation of phospho-Nrf2 and inhibited the altered level of autophagy factors.

Therefore, the diagnosis of AD holds significant importance. The interactions between regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain often involve multiple areas collaborating in a nonlinear manner. Leveraging these nonlinear higher-order interaction features to their fullest potential contributes to enhancing the accuracy of AD diagnosis. To address this, a framework combining nonlinear higher-order feature extraction and three-dimensional (3D) hypergraph neural networks is proposed for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD. First, a support vector machine regression model based on the radial basis function kernel was trained on ROI data to obtain a base estimator. Then, a recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the base estimator was applied to extract nonlinear higher-order features from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These features were subsequently constructed into a hypergraph, leveraging the complex interactions captured in the data. Finally, a four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal hypergraph convolutional neural network model was constructed based on the fMRI data for classification. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the Hyper Graph Convolutional Network (HyperGCN) framework by 8% and traditional two-dimensional (2D) linear feature extraction methods by 12% in the AD/normal control (NC) classification task.

HiMG responded to A\u03b2O with proinflammatory activation, which was mitigated by BHB at physiological concentrations of 0.1-2\u2009mM.

Consequently, these models may yield biased outcomes. In order to surmount this constraint, we propose a novel approach called Multi-Group TCCA (MG-TCCA), which enables the joint analysis of multiple subgroups. By incorporating a dual sparsity structure and a block coordinate ascent algorithm, our MG-TCCA method effectively addresses heterogeneity and leverages information across different groups to identify consistent signals. This novel approach facilitates the quantification of shared and individual structures, reduces data dimensionality, and enables visual exploration.

The idea that CSF is produced and/or filtered by the choroid plexus and flows in one direction throughout the ventricular system has been a largely accepted thesis. However, modern studies have called into question the validity of this hypothesis, suggesting that\u00a0CSF does not move unidirectionally\u00a0but rather is driven by microvessel contractions in a to-and-fro manner throughout the cerebrospinal system. Moreover, new insights suggest that in addition to CSF production, the exchange of fluids and proteins between the cortical vasculature and the interstitium may function as the brain's version of a lymphatic system. This comprehensive review provides evidence for a different framework of CSF flow. One that includes perivascular pulsations that push CSF back and forth, allowing exchange between the CSF and interstitium, and with CSF production occurring throughout the cerebrospinal system.

Many of the early attempts to develop treatments for AD focused on A\u03b2, but a lack of efficacy of these treatments in terms of slowing disease progression led to a change of strategy towards targeting of tau pathology. Given that tau shows a stronger correlation with symptom severity than does A\u03b2, targeting of tau is more likely to be efficacious once cognitive decline begins. Anti-tau therapies initially focused on post-translational modifications, inhibition of tau aggregation and stabilization of microtubules. However, trials of many potential drugs were discontinued because of toxicity and/or lack of efficacy. Currently, the majority of tau-targeting agents in clinical trials are immunotherapies.

The chemical tunability and smaller size make them easy to design selectively for target tissues. Other remarkable properties include antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, protection from hemorrhage stroke, and as therapeutic agents for gastric disorders, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Despite these unmatched properties, their practical applicability is often hindered due to their weak susceptibility to enzymatic digestion, degradation in serum, metabolism in the liver, clearance by the kidney, and immunogenic reactions. There are several methods adapted in order to increase the half-life of peptides such as chemical modifications, fusing with Fc fragment, change in amino acid composition, and by using carrier-based delivery. Among these, nano-carrier-mediated encapsulation not only increases the half-life of the peptides in vivo but also it aids in the targeted delivery.

The role of environmental pollution in neurodegeneration is largely unknown. Thus, this perspective advocates exposome research in C. elegans models of human diseases. The models express amyloid proteins such as A\u03b2, recapitulate the degeneration of specifically vulnerable neurons and allow for correlated neurobehavioral phenotyping throughout the entire life span of the nematode. Neurobehavioral traits like locomotion gaits, rigidity, or cognitive decline are quantifiable and carefully mimic key aspects of the human diseases. Underlying molecular pathways of neurodegeneration are elucidated in pollutant-exposed C. elegans Alzheimer's or Parkinson's models by transcriptomics (RNA-seq), mass spectrometry-based proteomics and omics addressing other biochemical traits. Validation of the identified disease pathways can be achieved by genome-wide association studies in matching human cohorts. A consistent One Health approach includes isolation of nematodes from contaminated sites and their comparative investigation by imaging, neurobehavioral profiling and single worm proteomics.

Moreover, we evaluated the immunoreactivity and insulin receptor (IR) distribution and markers for neurons and glial cells in the hippocampus of rats with SDAT and treated with taurine. For this, Male Wistar rats received STZ (ICV, 3\u00a0mg/kg, bilateral, 5ul per site, aCFS vehicle) and were treated with taurine (100\u00a0mg/kg orally, 1 time per day, saline vehicle) for 25 days. The animals were divided into 4 groups: vehicle (VE), taurine (TAU), ICV-STZ (STZ) and ICV-STZ plus taurine (STZ\u2009+\u2009TAU). At the end of taurine treatment, short- and long-term memory were assessed by performance on object recognition and Y-maze tasks. Insulin receptor (IR) was evaluated by immunoperoxidase while mature neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP, S100B, SOX9), and microglia (Iba-1) were evaluated by immunofluorescence. STZ induced worse spatial and recognition memory (INDEX) in YM and ORT tasks. Taurine protected against STZ-induced memory impairment. SDAT reduced the population of mature neurons as well as increased astrocytic and microglial reactivity, and taurine protected against these STZ-induced effects, mainly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Taurine increases IR expression in the hippocampus, and protects against the reduction in the density of this receptor in CA1 induced by STZ. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that taurine is able to enhance memory, up-regulates IR in the hippocampus, protects the neuron population, and reduces the astrogliosis found in SDAT.", "query": "cancer"}, "37937787": {"ArticleTitle": "Anti-BNLF2b Screening for Nasopharyngeal Cancer.", "AbstractText": "Kai-Xin-San (KXS) is a classic famous prescription composed of Polygalae Radix, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, and Poria. Clinically, KXS is effective in treating amnesia and regulating cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas its mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, the AD model rats were established by combining intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose (150 mg/kg/day) and intracerebral injection of A\u03b225-35 (10 \u03bcL) to investigate the meliorative effect of KXS on AD and explore its mechanism. After 1-month KXS treatment, Morris water maze test showed that different doses of KXS all improved the cognitive impairment of AD rats. The results of hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, and Tunnel staining showed that the neuron injury in the hippocampal CA1 region of the AD rats was markedly improved after KXS treatment. Concurrently, KXS reversed the levels of biochemical indexes of AD rats. Furthermore, the protein expressions of Wnt1 and \u03b2-catenin in KXS groups were remarkably increased, while the expressions of Bax and caspase-3 were significantly decreased. Besides, KXS-medicated serum reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and reactive oxygen species and regulated the protein expressions of \u03b2-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), p-GSK-3\u03b2, Bax, and caspase-3 in A\u03b225-35-induced pheochromocytoma cells.

After intracerebroventricular STZ injection in Long\u2011Evans male rats, intraperitoneal kaempferol was administered for 12 days.

In this brief review, we discuss evidence from basic neuroscience and clinical research which demonstrates the existence of endogenous molecular signaling pathways that can promote resilience to neurodegeneration. The p75 neurotrophin receptor provides one such pathway of resilience due to its role as a fundamental signaling switch which determines neuronal survival or degeneration. We highlight a series of preclinical studies targeting the p75 neurotrophin receptor in mouse models which demonstrate resilience to amyloid. We briefly discuss the design and goals of a recent clinical trial of p75 neurotrophin receptor modulation in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

Nerve cells have limited motion capability, whereas immune cells can migrate freely via circulation. This difference raises a variety of questions in the context of senile plaque formation and phagocytosis. Broad-scale unbiased genomic studies bring several genetic variants such as sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 3 (CD33), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) or complement receptor type 1 (CR1) into the focus of researchers' attention as potential risk factors for neuroinflammation.

Not all cellular hallmarks of aging are independent and several fall into the broader category of cellular rejuvenation, which captures returning cells to a more youthful, improved functional state. Cellular rejuvenation is quickly becoming a hot topic in the development of novel therapeutic modalities for a range of diseases. Therapeutic approaches utilizing cellular rejuvenation technologies are rapidly advancing and will represent the next phase of AD therapeutics. This review focuses on two important processes, epigenetic reprogramming, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) that play a critical role in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential therapeutic approaches (gene therapy, small molecule) towards targeting these mechanisms. In aging and in AD, epigenetic changes on DNA (e.g., hypermethylation on CpG islands) lead to alterations in gene expression. Partial epigenetic reprogramming utilizes transcription factors to remove the epigenetic marks and to rejuvenate cells to a more youthful state. During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, CMA becomes impaired resulting in a buildup of proteins known to be associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. The protein buildups lead to aggregates that preclude proteostasis leading to cell toxicity.

It precedes extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 in senile plaques and blood vessel walls, the intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau protein, microglial activation, and neuronal cell death. BBB disruption allows the coagulation protein fibrinogen to leak from the blood into the brain, where it is converted by thrombin cleavage into fibrin and deposits in the parenchyma and CNS vessels. Fibrinogen cleavage by thrombin exposes a cryptic epitope termed P2 which can bind CD11b and CD11c on microglia, macrophages and dendritic cells and trigger an inflammatory response toxic to neurons. Indeed, genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrates a causal role for fibrin in innate immune cell activation and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The P2 inflammatory epitope is spatially and compositionally distinct from the coagulation epitope on fibrin. Mouse monoclonal antibody 5B8, which targets the P2 epitope without interfering with the clotting process, has been shown to reduce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.

Early and accurate diagnosis of AD is crucial for implementing timely interventions and developing effective therapeutic strategies. Proteome-based biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for AD diagnosis and prognosis due to their ability to reflect disease-specific molecular alterations. There is of great significance for biomarkers in AD diagnosis and management. It emphasizes the limitations of existing diagnostic approaches and the need for reliable and accessible biomarkers. Proteomics, a field that comprehensively analyzes the entire protein complement of cells, tissues, or bio fluids, is presented as a powerful tool for identifying AD biomarkers. There is a diverse range of proteomic approaches employed in AD research, including mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and protein microarrays. The challenges associated with identifying reliable biomarkers, such as sample heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of the disease. There are well-known proteins implicated in AD pathogenesis, such as amyloid-beta peptides, tau protein, Apo lipoprotein E, and clusterin, as well as inflammatory markers and complement proteins. Validation and clinical utility of proteome-based biomarkers are addressing the challenges involved in validation studies and the diagnostic accuracy of these biomarkers. There is great potential in monitoring disease progression and response to treatment, thereby aiding in personalized medicine approaches for AD patients. There is a great role for bioinformatics and data analysis in proteomics for AD biomarker research and the importance of data preprocessing, statistical analysis, pathway analysis, and integration of multi-omics data for a comprehensive understanding of AD pathophysiology. In conclusion, proteome-based biomarkers hold great promise in the field of AD research.

To address this critical gap from association to causation, many fine mapping methods have been proposed to assign well-calibrated probabilities of causality to candidate variants, taking into account the underlying LD pattern. In this manuscript, we introduce a statistical framework that incorporates expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) information to fine mapping, built on the sum of single-effects (SuSiE) regression model. Our new method, SuSiE2, connects two SuSiE models, one for eQTL analysis and one for genetic fine mapping. This is achieved by first computing the posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) from an eQTL-based SuSiE model with the expression level of the candidate gene as the phenotype. These calculated PIPs are then utilized as prior inclusion probabilities for risk variants in another SuSiE model for the trait of interest. By leveraging eQTL information, SuSiE2 enhances the power of detecting causal SNPs while reducing false positives and the average size of credible sets by prioritizing functional variants within the candidate region. The advantages of SuSiE2 over SuSiE are demonstrated by simulations and an application to a single-cell epigenomic study for Alzheimer's disease.

The role for RyR2 in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory is well established and chronic hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 (RyR2P) is associated with pathological calcium leakage and cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. By comparison, little is known about the role of RyR2 in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) circuitry important for working memory, decision making, and reward seeking. Here, we evaluated the basal expression and localization of RyR2 and RyR2P in the vmPFC. Next, we employed an operant model of sucrose, cocaine, or morphine self-administration (SA) followed by a (reward-free) recall test, to reengage vmPFC neurons and reactivate reward-seeking and re-evaluated the expression and localization of RyR2 and RyR2P in vmPFC. Under basal conditions, RyR2 was expressed in pyramidal cells but not regularly detected in PV/SST interneurons. On the contrary, RyR2P was rarely observed in PFC somata and was restricted to a different subcompartment of the same neuron - the apical dendrites of layer-5 pyramidal cells. Chronic SA of drug (cocaine or morphine) and nondrug (sucrose) rewards produced comparable increases in RyR2 protein expression. However, recalling either drug reward impaired the usual localization of RyR2P in dendrites and markedly increased its expression in somata immunoreactive for Fos, a marker of highly activated neurons. These effects could not be explained by chronic stress or drug withdrawal and instead appeared to require a recall experience associated with prior drug SA. In addition to showing the differential distribution of RyR2/RyR2P and affirming the general role of vmPFC in reward learning, this study provides information on the propensity of addictive drugs to redistribute RyR2P ion channels in a neuronal population engaged in drug-seeking.

In fact, the earliest abnormality associated with the disease is the presence of phosphorylated tau protein in locus coeruleus neurons, a brain structure highly responsive to stress and perceived threat. Here, we introduce allostatic load as a useful concept for understanding many of the complex, interacting neuropathological changes involved in the AD degenerative process. In response to chronic stress, aberrant tau proteins that begin to accumulate within the locus coeruleus decades prior to symptom onset appear to represent a primary pathological event in the AD cascade, triggering a wide range of interacting brain changes involving neuronal excitotoxicity, endocrine alterations, inflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid plaque exacerbation.

The onset of AD involves a complex interplay among various factors, including age, genetics, chronic inflammation, and impaired energy metabolism. Despite significant efforts, there are currently no effective therapies capable of modifying the course of AD, likely owing to an excessive focus on the amyloid hypothesis and a limited consideration of other intracellular pathways. In the present review, we emphasize the emerging concept of AD as a metabolic disease, where alterations in energy metabolism play a critical role in its development and progression. Notably, glucose metabolism impairment is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and protein misfolding, forming interconnected processes that perpetuate a detrimental self-feeding loop sustaining AD progression. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), neurotoxic compounds that accumulate in AD, are considered an important consequence of glucose metabolism disruption, and glyceraldehyde (GA), a glycolytic intermediate, is a key contributor to AGEs formation in both neurons and astrocytes. Exploring the impact of GA-induced glucose metabolism impairment opens up exciting possibilities for creating an easy-to-handle in vitro model that recapitulates the early stage of the disease. This model holds great potential for advancing the development of novel therapeutics targeting various intracellular pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis.

By performing the Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, Western blotting analyses, and Circular Dichroism experiments, we found that ISOAC1 was able to reduce the A\u03b21-42 aggregation and conformational transition towards \u03b2-sheet structures. Interestingly, in silico studies revealed that ISOAC1 was able to bind to both the monomer and a pentameric protofibril of A\u03b21-42, establishing a hydrophobic interaction with the PHE19 residue of the A\u03b21-42 KLVFF motif. In vitro analyses on primary cortical neurons showed that ISOAC1 counteracted the increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels and decreased the A\u03b21-42-induced toxicity, in terms of mitochondrial activity reduction and increase of reactive oxygen species production. In addition, confocal microscopy analyses showed that ISOAC1 was able to reduce the A\u03b21-42 intraneuronal accumulation.

Brain insulin resistance has been implicated as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-diabetic drugs sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2-i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4-i) improve insulin sensitivity and provide neuroprotection. However, the effects of these two inhibitors on the brain metabolism and insulin resistance remain uninvestigated. We developed a T2D-AD mouse model using a high-fat diet (HFD) for 19 weeks along with a single dose of streptozotocin (100\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at the fourth week of HFD initiation. Subsequently, the animals were treated with SGLT2-i (empagliflozin, 25\u00a0mg/kg/day orally [p.o.]) and DPP4-i (sitagliptin, 100\u00a0mg/kg/day p.o.) for 7 weeks. Subsequently, behavioral tests were performed, and the expression of insulin signaling, AD-related, and other signaling pathway proteins in the brain were examined. T2D-AD mice not only showed increased blood glucose levels and body weight but also insulin resistance. SGLT2-i and DPP4-i effectively ameliorated insulin sensitivity and reduced body weight in these mice. Furthermore, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i significantly improved hippocampal-dependent learning, memory, and cognitive functions in the T2D-AD mouse model. Interestingly, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i reduced the hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) levels and amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation and enhanced brain insulin signaling. SGLT2-i reduced pTau accumulation through the angiotensin converting enzyme-2/angiotensin (1-7)/ mitochondrial assembly receptor axis, whereas DPP4-i reduced A\u03b2 accumulation by increasing insulin-degrading enzyme levels. These findings suggest that SGLT2-i and DPP4-i prevent AD-like pathology and cognitive dysfunction in T2D mice potentially through affecting brain insulin signaling via different mechanisms.", "query": "cancer"}, "37936044": {"ArticleTitle": "Association of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate with adverse outcomes in chronic hemodialysis patients.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a fatal, incurable, chronic neurodegenerative disease. Diagnosis in its early and even preclinical stages will be beneficial for its prevention and treatment. In the accepted pathological theory, abnormal accumulation of A\u03b2 protein and abnormal mitochondrial function, including changes in mitochondrial viscosity, is closely related to Alzheimer's disease. To date, rare fluorescent probes have been reported that can simultaneously image A\u03b2 plaques and mitochondrial viscosity. Therefore, the development of a dual-functional fluorescent probe for real-time fluorescence imaging of A\u03b2 plaques and mitochondrial viscosity is crucial to discover a novel approach and strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and to understand the pathological process and crosstalk between different biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of fluorescent probes QM-SF-1\u223c5 with dimethylamino-quinolinium as the skeleton and thiophene as the \u03c0 bridge to connect the groups with different electron-push/pull capacities.

Methods: We proposed an AD risk gene prediction framework based on spatial and temporal features of gene expression data. The gene expression data of providers of different tissues and ages were used as model features. Human genes were classified as AD risk or non-risk sets based on information extracted from relevant databases. Support vector machine (SVM) models were constructed to capture the expression patterns of genes believed to contribute to the risk of AD. Results: The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was utilized for feature selection. Data for 64 tissue-age features were obtained before feature selection, and this number was reduced to 19 after RFE was performed. The SVM models were built and evaluated using 19 selected and full features.

Here, the engineering of hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes to overexpress Fe65, enabled the development of a novel exosome-based targeted drug delivery system, which carried Corynoxine-B (Cory-B, an autophagy inducer) to the APP overexpressed-neuron cells in the brain of AD mice. The Fe65-engineered HT22 hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes (Fe65-EXO) loaded with Cory-B (Fe65-EXO-Cory-B) hijacked the signaling and blocked the natural interaction between Fe65 and APP, enabling APP-targeted delivery of Cory-B. Notably, Fe65-EXO-Cory-B induced autophagy in APP-expressing neuronal cells, leading to amelioration of the cognitive decline and pathogenesis in AD mice, demonstrating the potential of Fe65-EXO-Cory-B as an effective therapeutic intervention for AD.", "query": "cancer"}, "37935565": {"ArticleTitle": "Loss of ADAR1 in macrophages in combination with interferon gamma suppresses tumor growth by remodeling the tumor microenvironment.", "AbstractText": "The potential association between antimicrobial mouthwash use and systemic health has gained attention in recent years with reports highlighting how some common systemic conditions are influenced by the use of different types of mouthwashes.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a signaling molecule known to downregulate oxidative stress and inflammation. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the blood is widely used as a biomarker to monitor inflammation and immunity. This study examined the hypothesis that plasma AChE levels have a negative association with H2S levels and that a positive association exists between levels of NLR, HbA1c, and ROS with the AChE in the peripheral blood. The fasting blood sample was taken from 114 African Americans who had provided written informed consent approved by the IRB. The effect of H2S and high-glucose treatment on AChE activity levels was also investigated in THP-1 human monocytes. There was a significant negative relationship between AChE and the levels of H2S (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.41, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001); a positive association between the levels of AChE with age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.26, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), NLR (r\u00a0=\u00a00.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), ROS (r\u00a0=\u00a00.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and HbA1c levels (r\u00a0=\u00a00.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), in AA subjects.

In AD, the brain experiences three main structural changes: a significant decrease in the quantity of neurons, the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and the formation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) or senile plaques, which are protein deposits found outside cells and surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Genetic studies have identified four genes associated with autosomal dominant or familial early-onset AD (FAD): amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The formation of plaques primarily involves the accumulation of A\u03b2, which can be influenced by mutations in APP, PS1, PS2, or ApoE genes. Mutations in the APP and presenilin (PS) proteins can cause an increased amyloid \u03b2 peptides production, especially the further form of amyloidogenic known as A\u03b242. Apart from genetic factors, environmental factors such as cytokines and neurotoxins may also have a significant impact on the development and progression of AD by influencing the formation of amyloid plaques and intracellular tangles. Exploring the causes and implications of protein aggregation in the brain could lead to innovative therapeutic approaches. Some promising therapy strategies that have reached the clinical stage include using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antioxidants, and antiapoptotic agents. The most hopeful therapeutic strategies involve inhibiting activity of secretase and preventing the \u03b2-amyloid oligomers and fibrils formation, which are associated with the \u03b2-amyloid fibrils accumulation in AD. Additionally, immunotherapy development holds promise as a progressive therapeutic approach for treatment of AD. Recently, the two primary categories of brain stimulation techniques that have been studied for the treatment of AD are invasive brain stimulation (IBS) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS).

These proteins are more abundant in Alzheimer's patient brains, and their levels are positively correlated with cognitive decline, amyloid plaque deposition and neurofibrillary tangle burden. The MSN FERM domain interacts with the phospholipid PIP2 and the cytoplasmic tail of CD44. Inhibiting the MSN-CD44 interaction may help limit AD-associated neuronal damage. Here, we investigated the feasibility of developing inhibitors that target this protein-protein interaction. We have employed structural, mutational and phage-display studies to examine how CD44 binds to the FERM domain of MSN. Interestingly, we have identified an allosteric site located close to the PIP2 binding pocket that influences CD44 binding. These findings suggest a mechanism in which PIP2 binding to the FERM domain stimulates CD44 binding through an allosteric effect, leading to the formation of a neighboring pocket capable of accommodating a receptor tail. Furthermore, high-throughput screening of a chemical library identified two compounds that disrupt the MSN-CD44 interaction. One compound series was further optimized for biochemical activity, specificity, and solubility. Our results suggest that the FERM domain holds potential as a drug development target.

Some evidence indicates that mid-life depression may be an AD risk factor, while a chronic course of depression in late life may be a precursor to or symptom of dementia. Recently, multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the bidirectional relationship between depression and AD, including genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, the accumulation of AD-related biomarkers (e.g., amyloid beta and tau), and alterations in brain structure. That being the case, numerous therapeutic approaches, such as pharmacology treatments, psychotherapy, and lifestyle interventions, have been suggested as potential means of interfering with these pathways. However, the current literature on this topic remains fragmented and lacks a comprehensive review characterizing the association between depression and AD. In this review, we aim to address these gaps by providing an overview of the co-occurrence and temporal relationship between depression and AD, as well as exploring their underlying mechanisms.

Insulin resistance serves as a pivotal link between these two conditions, leading to diminished insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, and impaired glucose uptake. The brain, a vital organ in AD context, is also significantly impacted by insulin resistance, resulting in energy deficits and neuronal damage, which are hallmark features of the neurodegenerative disorder. To pave the way for potential therapeutic interventions targeting the insulin resistance pathway, it is crucial to comprehend the intricate pathophysiology of T3DM and identify the overlapped features between diabetes and AD. This comprehensive review article aims to explore various pathway such as AMPK, PPAR\u03b3, cAMP and P13K/Akt pathway as potential target for management of T3DM. Through the analysis of these complex mechanisms, our goal is to reveal their interdependencies and support the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies. The review extensively discusses several promising pharmaceutical candidates that have demonstrated dual drug action mechanisms, addressing both peripheral and cerebral insulin resistance observed in T3DM. These candidates hold significant promise for restoring insulin function and mitigating the detrimental effects of insulin resistance on the brain.

ALP dysfunction due to inherited defects in lysosomal or non-lysosomal proteins causes a group of diseases called lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) because of abnormal accumulation of lysosomal degradation substrates.

Especially in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), remarkable effort has been put into investigating molecular mechanisms behind this disease. Then, with the advent of 3D neuronal cultures and cerebral organoids (COs), several studies have demonstrated that this model can adequately mimic familial and sporadic AD. Therefore, we created an AD-CO model using iPSCs derived from patients with familial AD forms and explored early events and the progression of AD pathogenesis. Our study demonstrated that COs derived from three AD-iPSC lines with PSEN1(A246E) or PSEN2(N141I) mutations developed the AD-specific markers in\u00a0vitro, yet they also uncover tissue patterning defects and altered development.

Consumption of coffee is thought to reduce Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanism is still unexplored. Primarily, it is thought that components of coffee are the key players in making it a neuroprotectant. Caffeic acid (CA) is found in high quantities in coffee; thus, it is being increasingly explored to decipher its neuroprotection by various mechanisms. Iron is a toxic element in a free form capable of causing oxidative damage and ultimately contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, maintaining the proper iron levels is vital and human transferrin (Htf), a glycoprotein, is a key player in this aspect. In this work, we explored the binding mechanism of CA with Htf at the atomistic level, employing molecular docking and extensive molecular dynamics simulation (MD) approaches coupled with spectroscopic techniques in a bid to decipher the mode of interaction of CA with Htf. Molecular docking results demonstrated a strong binding affinity between CA and Htf. Furthermore, MD study highlighted the Htf-CA complex's stability and the ligand's minimal impact on Htf's overall structure. In silico approaches were further backed up by experimental approaches. Strong binding of CA with Htf was ascertained by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy observations.

It is also effective in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), ischemic stroke, and the CNS complications of diabetes, all of which share some pathological features with HD. Potent derivatives of fisetin with improved pharmacology were made that maintain its multiple biological activities (J. Med. Chem. 55:378, 2012). From 160 synthetic fisetin derivatives, one, CMS121, was selected for further study in the context of HD based on pharmacological parameters and its efficacy in animal models of AD. Both R6/2 and YAC128 mouse models of HD were used in these studies. We examined motor function using multiple assays as well as survival. In the R6/2 mice, we also looked at the effects of CMS121 on striatal gene expression. In both models, we found a slowing of motor dysfunction and an increase in median life span. Interestingly, in the YAC128 mice, the effects on the slowing in motor function loss became increasingly more pronounced as the mice aged. CMS121 also reduced HD-driven changes in the expression of genes associated with the proteasome and oxidative phosphorylation.

Here, we demonstrated that cognitive function was damaged in diabetic mice versus normal mice and treatment with TSA improved cognitive function in diabetic mice. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus revealed 174 differentially expressed proteins in diabetic mice compared with normal mice. TSA treatment reversed the expression levels of 111 differentially expressed proteins grouped into functional clusters, including the longevity regulating pathway, the insulin signaling pathway, peroxisomes, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction network analysis of TSA-reversed proteins revealed that UBA52, CAT, RPL29, RPL35A, CANX, RPL37, and PRKAA2 were the main hub proteins. Multiple KEGG pathway-enriched CAT and PRKAA2 levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of diabetic mice versus normal mice, which was reversed by TSA administration.

Here, we report in a tauopathy mouse model that APOE4 promoted the nucleocytoplasmic translocation and release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from hippocampal neurons, which correlated with the severity of hippocampal microgliosis and degeneration. Injection of HMGB1 into the hippocampus of young APOE4-tauopathy mice induced considerable and persistent gliosis. Selective removal of neuronal APOE4 reduced HMGB1 translocation and release. Treatment of APOE4-tauopathy mice with HMGB1 inhibitors effectively blocked the intraneuronal translocation and release of HMGB1 and ameliorated the development of APOE4-driven gliosis, Tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and myelin deficits. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that treatment with HMGB1 inhibitors diminished disease-associated and enriched disease-protective subpopulations of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in APOE4-tauopathy mice.

Methods: The present work was designed to explore the effects of chronic (28 days) treatment with low doses of cannabinoids: CBD (0.273\u2009mg/kg), THC (0.205\u2009mg/kg) or a combination of both (CBD:THC; 0.273\u2009mg/kg:0.205\u2009mg/kg) in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. Results: Our data revealed that THC-treated 5xFAD mice (but not other treatment groups) exhibited anxiogenic and depressant-like behavior. A significant improvement in spatial memory was observed only in the CBD:THC-treated group. Interestingly, all cannabinoid-treated groups showed significantly increased cortical levels of the insoluble form of beta amyloid 1-42.

Expression of apoE3 in microglia/CAMs improves cognitive function, increases microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and reduces amyloid pathology and associated toxicity, whereas apoE4 expression either compromises or has no effects on these outcomes by impairing lipid metabolism.

We aimed to clarify whether the anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin could prevent A\u03b2-mediated activation of the inflammasome. We demonstrated that A\u03b2 upregulated NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD, and cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase caspase (caspase 1) expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1).

These virtual visits could have been used to provide urgent medical care than the regular scheduled visits. We hypothesize that regular non-COVID-19-related virtual visits in the evaluated nursing home facilities were lower than COVID-19-related virtual visits during this period. The objective was to compare the frequency of COVID-19-related virtual visits with non-COVID-19-related virtual visits performed in three suburban nursing homes in Michigan from December 2020 through February 2022. Methods: Retrospective chart review of 283 patients, comprising 563 virtual visits. The most frequent ICD-10 diagnostic codes used by providers for primary encounters were analyzed for three participating facilities Results: Only 13.8% (78/563) of all virtual visits during the study period were for COVID-19 as a primary encounter.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in the regulation of AD. However, the function of most lncRNAs in AD remains to be elucidated. In this study, the effects of lncRNA ENST00000440246.1 on the biological characteristics of AD were explored. Differentially expressed lncRNAs in AD were identified through bioinformatics analysis and peripheral blood from thirty AD patients was collected to verify the expression of these lncRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The correlations between lncRNAs and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were assessed by Pearson's correlation analysis. Immunofluorescence (IF), Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays were conducted to evaluate the biological effect of ENST00000440246.1 and protein phosphatase 2\u00a0A (PP2A) in SK-N-SH cells. Gene expression at the protein and mRNA levels was analyzed by Western blotting and RT-qPCR. The interaction between PP2A and ENST00000440246.1 was confirmed by IntaRNA and RNA pulldown assays. ENST00000440246.1 was upregulated and significantly negatively correlated with the MMSE and MoCA scores and the overexpression of ENST00000440246.1 inhibited cell proliferation and facilitated apoptosis and A\u03b2 expression in SK-N-SH cells. Mechanistically, ENST00000440246.1 targeted PP2A and regulated AD-related gene expression. The silencing of ENST00000440246.1 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, PP2A overexpression reversed the influence of ENST00000440246.1 overexpression in SK-N-SH cells.

BPA can be found in epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics, which are frequently used in food storage and baby bottles. However, BPA can bind mainly to estrogen receptors, interfering with various neurologic functions, its use is a topic of significant concern. Nonetheless, the neurotoxicity of BPA has not been fully understood despite numerous investigations on its disruptive effects. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the most recent studies on the implications of BPA on the neurologic system. Our findings suggest that BPA exposure impairs various structural and molecular brain changes, promoting oxidative stress, changing expression levels of several crucial genes and proteins, destructive effects on neurotransmitters, excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation, damaged blood-brain barrier function, neuronal damage, apoptosis effects, disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, increase in reactive oxygen species, promoted apoptosis and intracellular lactate dehydrogenase release, a decrease of axon length, microglial DNA damage, astrogliosis, and significantly reduced myelination. Moreover, BPA exposure increases the risk of developing neurologic diseases, including neurovascular (e.g. stroke) and neurodegenerative (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) diseases. Furthermore, epidemiological studies showed that the adverse effects of BPA on neurodevelopment in children contributed to the emergence of serious neurological diseases like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), depression, emotional problems, anxiety, and cognitive disorders. In summary, BPA exposure compromises human health, promoting the development and progression of neurologic disorders.

In contrast, naturally occurring cancer represents the leading cause of death in pet dogs, and specific breeds like the Golden Retriever (GR) carry up to a 65% cancer-related death rate. We hypothesized that GWAS of long-lived GRs might lead to the identification of genetic variants capable of modifying longevity within this cancer-predisposed breed. A GWAS was performed comparing GR dogs\u2009\u2265\u200914\u00a0years to dogs dying prior to age 12 which revealed a significant association to ERBB4, the only member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family capable of serving as both a tumor suppressor gene and an oncogene. No coding variants were identified, however, distinct haplotypes in the 5'UTR were associated with reduced lifespan in two separate populations of GR dogs. When all GR dogs were analyzed together (n\u2009=\u2009304), the presence of haplotype 3 was associated with shorter survival (11.8\u00a0years vs. 12.8\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.024). GRs homozygous for haplotype 3 had the shortest survival, and GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 had the longest survival (11.6\u00a0years vs. 13.5\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.0008). Sub-analyses revealed that the difference in lifespan for GRs carrying at least 1 copy of haplotype 3 was specific to female dogs (p\u2009=\u20090.009), whereas survival remained significantly different in both male and female GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 or haplotype 3 (p\u2009=\u20090.026 and p\u2009=\u20090.009, respectively).

How the transfer of aSyn between cells occurs is still being studied, but one important hypothesis involves receptor-mediated transport. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that the cellular prion protein (PrPC ) may play a crucial role in this process. PrPC has been shown to act as a receptor/sensor for protein aggregates in different neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the interaction between aSyn and PrPC and discuss its role in synucleinopathies.

Neurotoxicity manifests when exposure to these chemicals disrupts the normal functioning of the nervous system, and some neurotoxic agents have been linked to neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The growing concern surrounding the neurotoxic impacts of both naturally occurring and man-made toxic substances necessitates the identification of animal models for rapid testing across a wide spectrum of substances and concentrations, and the utilization of tools capable of detecting nervous system alterations spanning from the molecular level up to the behavioural one. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is gaining prominence in the field of neuroscience due to its versatility. The possibility of analysing all developmental stages (embryo, larva and adult), applying the most common \"omics\" approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, etc.) and conducting a wide range of behavioural tests makes zebrafish an excellent model for neurotoxicity studies. This review delves into the main experimental approaches adopted and the main markers analysed in neurotoxicity studies in zebrafish, showing that neurotoxic phenomena can be triggered not only by exposure to chemical substances but also by fluctuations in temperature.

Plasma phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau) have shown potential as such biomarkers. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), threonine 217 (p-tau217) and threonine 231 (p-tau231) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. All p-tau isoforms increase as a function of A\u03b2-accumulation and discriminate healthy individuals from those at preclinical AD stages with high accuracy. P-tau231 increases earliest, followed by p-tau181 and p-tau217. In advanced stages, all p-tau isoforms are associated with the clinical classification of AD and increase with disease severity, with the greatest increase seen for p-tau217. This is also reflected by a better correlation of p-tau217 with A\u03b2 scans, whereas both, p-tau217 and p-tau181 correlated equally with tau scans. However, at the very advanced stages, p-tau181 begins to plateau, which may mirror the trajectory of the A\u03b2 pathology and indicate an association with a more intermediate risk of AD. Across the AD continuum, the incremental increase in all biomarkers is associated with structural changes in widespread brain regions and underlying cognitive decline. Furthermore, all isoforms differentiate AD from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, making them specific for AD. Incorporating p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 in clinical use requires further studies to examine ideal cut-points and harmonize assays.", "query": "cancer"}, "37933213": {"ArticleTitle": "Does Laterality in Breast Cancer still have the Importance to be Studied?

Tau seeding may underlie its predictable spread in these diseases. Molecular chaperones can modulate tau pathology, but their effects have mainly been studied in isolation. This study employed a semi-high throughput assay to identify molecular chaperones influencing tau seeding using Tau RD P301S FRET Biosensor cells, which express a portion of tau containing the frontotemporal dementia-related P301S tau mutation fused to a FRET biosensor. Approximately fifty chaperones from five major families were screened using live cell imaging to monitor FRET-positive tau seeding. Among the tested chaperones, five exhibited significant effects on tau in the primary screen. Notably, three of these were from the DnaJ family. In subsequent studies, overexpression of DnaJA2, DnaJB1, and DnaJB6b resulted in significant reductions in tau levels. Knockdown experiments by shRNA revealed an inverse correlation between DnaJB1 and DnaJB6b with tau levels. DnaJB6b overexpression, specifically, reduced total tau levels in a cellular model with a pre-existing pool of tau, partially through enhanced proteasomal degradation. Further, DnaJB6b interacted with tau complexes. These findings highlight the potent chaperone activity within the DnaJ family, particularly DnaJB6b, towards tau.", "query": "cancer"}}
