    "**Explanation:** To determine the best quality score in the given string, I first create a list to hold the quality scores and calculate the quality scores for each character in the string, appending each to the list. Then, when reporting the answer, I find the maximum score in the list, extract the index of that score, and report the character corresponding to that index in the original string. To calculate the average quality score, I sum all the quality scores in the list and divide by the length of the list; this returned a float. To report this as a character, I chose to truncate the float by casting it as an integer, and then converting it to a character. Consequently, the average character may be inflated or deflated compared to the actual average depending on the decimal. To simultaneously report the best quality measurement, the average quality measurement, and the single-character quality score, I chose to return a dictionary. I am convinced that the function works because it correctly reports the best quality character, `F`, which has the highest code point in Unicode; it provides a reasonable average quality score; and the average character is the correct conversion from the average score."

    "**Explanation, discussion of findings, and clinical significance:** Calling `administer_meds(0.25, 1)` causes the loop to run four times, administering four doses. Because the function administers the dose first before incrementing the time, the doses are administered starting at $time = 0$, incrementing by $0.25$ for a total of four doses until $1.0$ is reached. This is expected behavior, as $1/0.25 = 4$ doses were expected, and all of the exact times were reached. The clinical significance of this result is that the doses are administered correctly, but administered a bit in advance before the time limit is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, calling `administer_meds(0.1, 1)` causes the loop to run 11 times, administering 11 doses at odd time intervals. This is unexpected behavior, because $1/0.1=10$ doses were expected, the time intervals were not consistent, and there were strange floating point numbers (`t=0.30000000000000004`, `t=0.7999999999999999`, `t=0.8999999999999999`, `t=0.9999999999999999`). The clinical significance of this result is that the function administers more doses than intended, may be administering them at unintended times, and administers them a bit in advance before the time limit is reached."
